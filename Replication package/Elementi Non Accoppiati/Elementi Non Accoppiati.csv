In some circumstances, the keywords that the user searches on are only semantically related to the data rather than via an exact or fuzzy match. Hence, semantic-based keyword search over encrypted cloud data becomes of paramount importance. However, existing schemes usually depend upon a global dictionary, which not only affects the accuracy of search results but also causes inefficiency in data updating. Additionally, although compound keyword search is common in practice, the existing approaches only process them as single words, which split the original semantics and achieve low accuracy. To address these limitations, we initially propose a compound concept semantic similarity (CCSS) calculation method to measure the semantic similarity between compound concepts. Next, by integrating CCSS with Locality-Sensitive Hashing function and the secure kk<; inline-graphic xlink:href=""wang-ieq1-2847318.gif""/>-Nearest Neighbor scheme, a semantic-based compound keyword search (SCKS) scheme is proposed. SCKS achieves not only semantic-based search but also multi-keyword search and ranked keyword search. Additionally, SCKS also eliminates the predefined global library and can efficiently support data update. The experimental results on real-world dataset indicate that SCKS introduces low overhead on computation and the search accuracy outperforms the existing schemes.","2021-06-01","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","850-863","","3","14","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Searchable encryption; Keyword search; semantic similarity; Encryption; compound concept; Compounds; Indexes; semantic-based keyword search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So, vendor lock-in problem appeared. One solution to this problem is to use generic APIs with specific adapters. However, any update in a PaaS specific-API makes its corresponding adapter is unusable which causes, what we call, API synchronization problem. Therefore, STAGER (SemanTic-based GenERation of Generic-API Adapters) framework is proposed. STAGER framework provides a semi-automatic adapter generation process, which generates specific adapters of generic APIs for PaaS services (e.g., blob storage and datastore services) for target PaaS platforms. The adapter generation process is based on semantic annotations of the generic APIs and their corresponding PaaS specific-APIs. In order to evaluate STAGER framework, two generic APIs for blob storage and NoSQL datastore services have been proposed. STAGER framework is used to generate the adapters of these generic APIs for two PaaS platforms: Google App Engine (GAE) and Windows Azure. Although there is some overhead for semantically annotating the PaaS APIs, the evaluation results prove the feasibility of STAGER framework and promote the usage of the generated adapters for implementing portable cloud applications.","2021-06-01","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","903-914","","3","14","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontologies; Computer architecture; semantic annotation; Adaptation models; generic API; Java; PaaS heterogeneity; vendor lock-in; Computational modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

KGFabric is able to manage Peta-scale data and has supported graph fabric and analysis with over 100 billion relations at Ant Group. We conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate the performance of KGFabric.
