	abstract = {Keyword search over encrypted data is essential for accessing outsourced sensitive data in cloud computing. In some circumstances, the keywords that the user searches on are only semantically related to the data rather than via an exact or fuzzy match. Hence, semantic-based keyword search over encrypted cloud data becomes of paramount importance. However, existing schemes usually depend upon a global dictionary, which not only affects the accuracy of search results but also causes inefficiency in data updating. Additionally, although compound keyword search is common in practice, the existing approaches only process them as single words, which split the original semantics and achieve low accuracy. To address these limitations, we initially propose a compound concept semantic similarity (CCSS) calculation method to measure the semantic similarity between compound concepts. Next, by integrating CCSS with Locality-Sensitive Hashing function and the secure kk{\textless}; inline-graphic xlink:href="wang-ieq1-2847318.gif"/{\textgreater}-Nearest Neighbor scheme, a semantic-based compound keyword search (SCKS) scheme is proposed. SCKS achieves not only semantic-based search but also multi-keyword search and ranked keyword search. Additionally, SCKS also eliminates the predefined global library and can efficiently support data update. The experimental results on real-world dataset indicate that SCKS introduces low overhead on computation and the search accuracy outperforms the existing schemes.},

	abstract = {In PaaS model, providers have different proprietary APIs, which make developers locked inside a specific platform and not able to easily port their applications among different platforms. So, vendor lock-in problem appeared. One solution to this problem is to use generic APIs with specific adapters. However, any update in a PaaS specific-API makes its corresponding adapter is unusable which causes, what we call, API synchronization problem. Therefore, STAGER (SemanTic-based GenERation of Generic-API Adapters) framework is proposed. STAGER framework provides a semi-automatic adapter generation process, which generates specific adapters of generic APIs for PaaS services (e.g., blob storage and datastore services) for target PaaS platforms. The adapter generation process is based on semantic annotations of the generic APIs and their corresponding PaaS specific-APIs. In order to evaluate STAGER framework, two generic APIs for blob storage and NoSQL datastore services have been proposed. STAGER framework is used to generate the adapters of these generic APIs for two PaaS platforms: Google App Engine (GAE) and Windows Azure. Although there is some overhead for semantically annotating the PaaS APIs, the evaluation results prove the feasibility of STAGER framework and promote the usage of the generated adapters for implementing portable cloud applications.},

	abstract = {Based on the diversified application scenarios at Ant Group, we built the Ant Knowledge Graph Platform (AKGP). It has constructed numerous domain-specific knowledge graphs related to merchants, companies, accounts, products, and more. AKGP manages trillions of structured knowledge graphs, serving search, recommendation, risk control and other businesses. However, as the demand increasing for various workloads such as graph pattern matching, graph representation learning, and cross-domain knowledge reuse, the existing warehouse systems based on relational DBMS or graph databases are unable to meet the requirements. To address these issues, we propose KGFabric, an industrial-scale knowledge graph management system built on the distributed file system (DFS). KGFabric offers a nearline knowledge storage engine that utilizes a Semantic-enhanced Programmable Graph (SPG) model, which is compatible with the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model. The data is persistently stored in DFS, such as HDFS, which leverages the POSIX file system API, making it suitable for deployment in multi-cloud environment at low cost. KGFabric provides a native graph-based and hybrid storage format that can serve as a shared backend for parallel graph computing systems, significantly accelerating the analysis of multi-workload. Additionally, KGFabric includes a graph fabric framework that minimizes data duplication and guarantees data security. KGFabric is able to manage Peta-scale data and has supported graph fabric and analysis with over 100 billion relations at Ant Group. We conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate the performance of KGFabric. Compared with popular relational DBMS and graph databases, the storage space for semantic relations is reduced by over 90\%. The performance of graph fabric improves by 21X in real-world workloads. In multi-hop semantic graph analysis, KGFabric enhances performance by 100X. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
