  abstract={During the last years we have seen a dramatic increase of new Cloud providers, applications, services, management platforms, data, etc. reaching a level of complexity that implies the necessity of new solutions to deal with such vast, shared and heterogeneous services and resources. Consequently, challenges often related to interoperability, portability, security, discovery, selection, negotiation and description of cloud service and resource may take place. In this sense, Semantic Web Technologies, holding a great potential to cloud computing, have been proven as an efficient means to relive these challenges. This paper examines and explores the role of Semantic Web Technologies in the cloud from a wide variety of literatures. Various approaches, architectures, and frameworks are screened and evaluated based on eight prime research questions. At the end of the review, research opportunities in the form of a roadmap are discussed.},

  pages={433-442},
  abstract={Cloud services have been adopted by more and more consumers and different types of businesses. An intrinsically difficult problem faced by service consumers and businesses is that no standard way to evaluate and compare cloud services' trustworthiness, while trust has already become a critical factor for service and service provider selection. In this paper, we propose a trustworthiness evaluation and comparison framework to help make customized selection decisions based on trustworthiness. This framework utilizes fuzzy processing and neural network to handle subjectivity and inaccuracy, and customized recommendation. A feedback learning mechanism is also incorporated to make the entire framework be adaptive to users' preferences. The framework is implemented as prototype system to evaluate and recommend different types of cloud services. Experiments on different types of services and different types of trustworthiness prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

  abstract={Cyber Security breaches and attacks are on the ascendancy as corporations, governments, universities, and private individuals are conducting their business and personal transactions on the web. This increasing participating on the web necessitates that robust and efficient cyber security systems need to be put in place by these entities to safeguard their cyber assets. Intelligent Systems needs to be employed to buttress the cyber security protocols established in cloud computing for proper decision-making, which may depend on the effective knowledge representation. However, as one of the dominant industry standards for knowledge representation, Web Ontology Language (OWL) has limitations, such as the lack of support for custom relations. Pace University has extended OWL to support Knowledge Graph as a replacement to better support knowledge representation and decision making. This paper examines using KG as the basis in the design of a knowledge-representation system that drives the filtration process of a company's cyber security ecosystem in cloud computing by employing a use case of cyber security communications in-order to identify the entity relations of threat types for the filtration process.},

  pages={301-306},
  abstract={As a recent emerging industry, cybersecurity insurance has been growing ambitiously fast, which mainly serves the financial industry and assists financial firms to reduce cybersecurity risks. Understanding the risk classification is an important hemisphere for operating cybersecurity insurance. However, the classification representation will be complicated when the service system becomes large. Improper presentation of the risks can result in financial loss or operational mistakes. This paper addresses this concern and proposes an approach using ontology-based knowledge representation for cybersecurity insurance. The approach is named as Semantic Cyber Incident Classification (SCIC) model, which uses knowledge representation deriving from semantic techniques. Our approach is specifically designed for targeting at cybersecurity insurance domain, which has been assessed by our experiments.},

  abstract={Developing countries have very high patients-per-doctor ratios. Therefore, analysing the adaptability of self-care for developing countries is of prime importance. We have investigated how health posts and pharmacies could promote self-care in developing countries. We have restricted ourselves on the ways these organizations could assist patients in exploiting health-oriented network services such as Personal Health Records (PHRs) and public medical data sources. Our ultimate goal is to promote information therapy (Ix) as it aims to prescribe the right information to right people at right time. In our solution, Ix is carried out by a SPARQL engine, which is capable for accessing PHRs and other medical data sources within a query. Thus we can augment patient's data in PHR by external data sources. Such automatic augmentation is based on the overlapping ontologies that model PHRs' data as well the data in public medical data sources.},

  abstract={The United States and its Allied Forces have had tremendous success in combat operations. This includes combat in Germany, Japan and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. However not all of our stabilization and reconstruction operations (SARO) have been as successful. Several studies have been carried out on SARO by organizations such as the National Defense University and the Naval Post Graduate School. These studies have shown that security as well as power and jobs are key ingredients for success during SARO. One of the major conclusions is that we need to plan for SARO while we are planning for combat. These studies have also analyzed the various technologies that are needed for successfully carrying out SARO which include sensors, robotics and information management. As stated in the work by the Naval Postgraduate School, we need to determine the social, political and economic relationships between the local communities as well as determine who the important people are. One particular task during SARO is managing emergencies and crisis situations as well as carrying out humanitarian operations. In such situations, it is critical that the information between various individuals as well as agencies be shared. Furthermore, social relationships between the different parties need to be analyzed. To address the key technical challenges for emergency management and crisis response during SARO and related humanitarian efforts we are exploring assured information sharing and secure social networking to develop novel technologies to support emergency management and crisis response.},

  number={},
  pages={1024-1032},
  abstract={Linked data mining has become one of the key questions in HPC graph mining in recent years. However, the existing RDF database engines are not scalable and are less reliable in heterogeneous clouds. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Acacia-RDF which is a scalable distributed RDF graph database engine developed with X10 programming language to solve this issue. Acacia-RDF partitions the RDF data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable SPARQL processor for Acacia-RDF which operates on top of partitioned RDF data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the implementation of scalable graph algorithms such as Triangle counting with such partitioned data sets. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of LUBM RDF benchmark data sets and make a comparison of Acacia's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-RDF scales well with LUBM data sets. Acacia-RDF reported approximately 2 seconds elapsed time on 4 places for running the first and third queries of the LUBM benchmark on LUBM scale 40 data set. Through this work we introduce the use of X10 language for scalable RDF graph data management.},

  title={Semantic validation of affinity constrained service function chain requests}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={202-210},
  abstract={Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has been proposed as a paradigm to increase the cost-efficiency, flexibility and innovation in network service provisioning. By leveraging IT virtualization techniques in combination with programmable networks, NFV is able to decouple network functionality from the physical devices on which they are deployed. This opens up new business opportunities for both Infrastructure Providers (InPs) as well as Service Providers (SPs), where the SP can request to deploy a chain of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on top of which its service can run. However, current NFV approaches lack the possibility for SPs to define location requirements and constraints on the mapping of virtual functions and paths onto physical hosts and links. Nevertheless, many scenarios can be envisioned in which the SP would like to attach placement constraints for efficiency, resilience, legislative, privacy and economic reasons. Therefore, we propose a set of affinity and anti-affinity constraints, which can be used by SPs to define such placement restrictions. This newfound ability to add constraints to Service Function Chain (SFC) requests also introduces an additional risk that SFCs with conflicting constraints are requested or automatically generated. Therefore, a framework is proposed that allows the InP to check the validity of a set of constraints and provide feedback to the SP. To achieve this, the SFC request and relevant information on the physical topology are modeled as an ontology of which the consistency can be checked using a semantic reasoner. Enabling semantic validation of SFC requests, eliminates inconsistent SFCs requests from being transferred to the embedding algorithm.},

  year={2016},

  pages={139-142},
  abstract={To effectively manage cloud based services, organizations need to continuously monitor the performance metrics listed in the Cloud service contracts. However, these legal documents, like Service Level Agreements (SLA) or privacy policy documents, are currently managed as plain text files meant principally for human consumption. Additionally, providers often define their own performance metrics for their services. These factors hinder the automation of SLA management and require manual effort to monitor the cloud service performance. We have significantly automated the process of extracting, managing and monitoring cloud SLA using natural language processing techniques and Semantic Web technologies. In this paper, we describe our technical approach and the ontology that we have developed to describe, manage, and reason about cloud SLAs. We also describe the prototype system that we have developed to automatically extract information from legal Terms of Service that are available on cloud provider websites.},

  pages={147-150},
  abstract={Appealing features of cloud services motivate consumers to migrate their core businesses to them. However, there are challenges about security, privacy, and compliance. Building compliant systems is difficult because of the complex nature of regulations and cloud systems. In addition, the lack of reference architectures (RAs) makes compliance even harder. RAs should be complete, precise, abstract, vendor neutral, platform independent, with no implementation details, however, their levels of detail and abstraction are still debatable and there is no accepted definition about what an RA should contain. Existing approaches used to build RAs lack structured templates and systematic procedures. In addition, most approaches do not take full advantage of patterns and best practices that promote architectural qualities such as modularity, reusability, flexibility and usability. We propose here a five-step approach to build an RA that can improve the quality of the concrete architectures derived from it and from which we can derive more specialized RAs. These RAs take advantage of patterns and best practices that promote software quality.},

We propose Semantic Data Platform (SDP), built around the semantics of the information derived out of product integration. This approach of semantic model based data sharing provides extreme loose coupling among products, makes extension of information from a given product possible with zero impact on rest of the system. Easy certification of integration enables evolution of products fairly independent of each other. SDP offers semantic federation and querying, therefore it can fetch any data irrespective of the product where the data lives. Thus, 'Any Data from a product can be offered as a Service'.},

  pages={55-70},
  abstract={Cloud monitoring is of a source of big data that are constantly produced from traces of infrastructures, platforms, and applications. Analysis of monitoring data delivers insights of the system's workload and usage pattern and ensures workloads are operating at optimum levels. The analysis process involves data query and extraction, data analysis, and result visualization. Since the volume of monitoring data is big, these operations require a scalable and reliable architecture to extract, aggregate, and analyze data in an arbitrary range of granularity. Ultimately, the results of analysis become the knowledge of the system and should be shared and communicated. This paper presents our cloud service architecture that explores a search cluster for data indexing and query. We develop REST APIs that the data can be accessed by different analysis modules. This architecture enables extensions to integrate with software frameworks of both batch processing (such as Hadoop) and stream processing (such as Spark) of big data. The analysis results are structured in Semantic Media Wiki pages in the context of the monitoring data source and the analysis process. This cloud architecture is empirically assessed to evaluate its responsiveness when processing a large set of data records under node failures.},

  pages={2546-2559},
  abstract={In cloud computing, searchable encryption scheme over outsourced data is a hot research field. However, most existing works on encrypted search over outsourced cloud data follow the model of “one size fits all” and ignore personalized search intention. Moreover, most of them support only exact keyword search, which greatly affects data usability and user experience. So how to design a searchable encryption scheme that supports personalized search and improves user search experience remains a very challenging task. In this paper, for the first time, we study and solve the problem of personalized multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data (PRSE) while preserving privacy in cloud computing. With the help of semantic ontology WordNet, we build a user interest model for individual user by analyzing the user's search history, and adopt a scoring mechanism to express user interest smartly. To address the limitations of the model of “one size fit all” and keyword exact search, we propose two PRSE schemes for different search intentions. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate our analysis and show that our proposed solution is very efficient and effective.},

It facilitates scalability and virtualized resources over internet as a service providing cost effective and scalable solution to customers. As the customer needs are growing for the solutions of the complex problem, there is the need for the services from different cloud service providers so that resources will be properly utilized. To execute and handle the complex business application over clouds as demands by the users, interoperable solution is provided. Federated cloud computation gives the advantage of cost reduction and energy saving. Cloud architecture uses virtualization technique for having the provision of more than one virtual machine on the same physical host. Interoperable cloud architecture solves the problem of vendor lock-in and portability, saves energy reduce power consumption and promote green cloud computing. This paper describes Interoperability issues and standard architecture of cloud computing suitable for the use of services from multiple service providers to provide portability.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is a model delivery of infrastructure, platform and software services over the net. The lack of standardization of heterogeneous Cloud service descriptions makes service discovery and selection very complex tasks for Cloud users. To ease this complexity, it is crucial to describe the various Cloud service pertinent information in a homogeneous model. To provide for such model, this paper offers to contributions. First, it proposes a Cloud description ontology that integrates service descriptions obtained from heterogeneous sources. The ontology model accounts for the functional and non-functional properties, attributes and relations of infrastructure, platform and software services in order to facilitate the discovery and selection of suitable Cloud services. Second, this paper presents a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed ontology. For the qualitative evaluation, we use a reasoner to identify defects in the ontology, whilst for the quantitative evaluation we compare our search results with those obtained through a web search engine.},

  abstract={The proposed eHealth Recommendation Service System (eHeaRSS) is to recommend health service information to patients whenever and wherever. Nowadays, depending on online networks popularity, there are a lot of research starting to focus on patient-context to apply health care fields like tele-health, tele-care, medical traveling, and so on. The proposed eHeaRSS is like a family doctor to care patients, especially to use generated patients-context. eHeaRSS is a recommendation system for immediate and appropriate medical services using crowd sourcing in cloud computing environment. To do this, it is necessary to classify the data into symptoms, diseases, departments and doctors related data types. To consider hierarchies or subsume relationships among them, eHeaRSS Ontology (eHeaRSS-Ont) is developed through integration of 4-static ontology (4-Ont) which is comprised of symptom-, disease-, department-and doctor-Ont to create tailored recommendations depending on patient-context. For the recommendation service, Case-based reasoning (CBR) is applied. The extracted cases using 4-Ont are integrated by eHeaRSS-Ont depending on the patient-context. For customization, it is necessary to reconfigure the case using eHeaRSS Constraints Value Compatibility Map (eHeaRSS-CVCM). To prove the significance and efficiency of the eHeaRSS, we experimented using ontology-based data processing and proved the superiority of eHeaRSS with the provision of better recommendation than other DB-based systems.},

  pages={1139-1142},
  abstract={With the explosive growth of medical information, the users not only query information efficiently and accurately, but also pay attention to the information of sensitivity and privacy. In medical domains, the current privacy preserving methods either use the technology of Access Control List, or need to prepare training documents for each privacy policy. However, it is a time-consuming and impractical way for data owners to assign a privacy policy on each document. In this paper, by exploiting the privacy medical queries, we propose a novel approach based on semantic and ontology to achieve the topic-level privacy preserving search. With the support of them, we first mine all the potential hierarchy and semantics from a user query and acquire sensitive terms relative to privacy policies automatically without training documents.},

  year={2015},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={601-606},
  abstract={The term "trust" in the area of cloud computing has always been one of the most problematic issues. The cloud user becomes willing to accept insecure conditions and unconsciously increases these conditions' security level if he is able to find a strategy that provides trust. This level of trust, once established, is difficult to maintain if any deception takes place. The indications of proven trust can only be seen in future usage of a cloud service. For this reason, specific control instruments are required to ascertain the accuracy of one's trust. The establishment of trust in a public cloud environment requires a paradigm change: a holistic strategy that enforces regulation requirements throughout the cloud architecture. The movement of the root of trust into hardware reduces vulnerability to compromise, as hardware attacks require a high expenditure of time and effort. Cloud users would define regulation standards through trust-worthy IT instruments and enforce them in specific cloud-service layers. The extension of this approach is the regulation of SaaS-based applications to enforce requirements for separation and availability. This work introduces a conceptual approach to establish a chain of policy by using hardware-oriented root of trust. The conceptual description of a chain of policy outlines the main principles to enforce regulations accurately for each architectural cloud layer based on an established chain of trust.},

  abstract={One of the most important challenges that have threatened cloud computing and caused its slow adoption is security. Since clouds have diverse groups of users with different sets of security requirements, restricting the users' accesses and protecting information from unauthorized accesses have become the most difficult tasks. To address these critical challenges, in this paper we first formalize Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) and propose a new access control model, called Attribute-Rule ABAC (AR-ABAC), for cloud computing to meet critical access control requirements in clouds. Our model supports the attribute-rules that deal with the association between users and objects, as well as the capability for accessing objects based on their sensitivity levels. The attribute-rules specify an agreement that determines what kind of attributes should be used and the number of attributes considered for making access decisions. In addition, our model ensures secure resource sharing among potential untrusted tenants and supports different access permissions to the same user at the same session.},

  abstract={The ad-hoc mobile market is the environment that allows the interconnectivity of mobile devices within community of users that are ready to communicate and share services between providers and consumers. Issues like service discovery and selection are major obstacle in ad-hoc mobile. With the growing of this market, researchers are concentrating on service discovery with little on selection. Provision of optimal service in ad-hoc mobile is a challenge and our goal. To address this, most scholars use various algorithms. For example, the dynamic programming or greedy algorithm, but the complexity of these algorithms especially when the number of consumers and providers in the market are many poses a challenge. To tackle this, we propose Analytic Hierarchy Model (AHM). This model uses the QoS criteria as required by consumers and then systematically process it to rank the services to obtain the optimal service. Experiment is conducted using reputation and location as our criteria. The optimal service is selected based on the required QoS of the consumer.},

  pages={414-419},
  abstract={Cloud computing environment is influenced by user-dependent quality of service (QoS) parameters in evaluating the performance of Web services apart from others factors. Among the performance QoS parameters, mainly response-time and throughput could be modulated to provide very efficient services for cloud users. As per user's requirement, the service provider's recommendation of appropriate Web services to the end-users with proper QoS satisfaction is one of the critical issues. This can be recommended to end-users in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) under Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) of WS-Policy. Generally, the matrix of collected QoS parameter values is sparse and the accurate prediction of the missing QoS values is important for the recommendation of appropriate web services to the end users. To address this issue, we worked out an artificial neural network model for the prediction of missing QoS-values using past QoS performance parameter data. In this current work, the performances of different learning algorithms of ANN are analyzed for enhanced prediction of QoS performance values. The ANN model with Bayesian-Regularization is found to be better performing when compared to other learning algorithms.},

Service matching is discussed in web services composition and user oriented service marketplaces contexts. The suggested approaches have different problem definitions and have to be examined closer in order to identify comparable results and to find out which approaches have built on the former ones. One of the most important use cases is service requesters with limited technical knowledge who need to compare services based on their QoS requirements in cloud service marketplaces. Our survey examines the service matching approaches in order to find out the relation between their context and their objectives. Moreover, it evaluates their applicability for the cloud service marketplaces context.},

In this paper, a novel system is presented, designed as part of the RAPP project that aims to assist senior citizens with mild cognitive impairment in performing cognitive tests as a means of exercise, while also keeping track of their performance. Our goal is to provide an interactive and intriguing user friendly alternative to the classic cognitive tests that will keep the patient interested and thus increase compliance. Tracking the patient's performance in the cognitive tests can prove invaluable as the data can be further associated with medical treatment or lifestyle changes and conclusively lead to better understanding of the nature of cognitive decline.},

We used Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to represent access control policies as rules, and we verified the rules with an OWL-DL reasoner. Additionally, we implemented HIPAA security rules through access control policies in a cloud-based simulated healthcare environment. More specifically, we investigated access control policy specification and enforcement for cloud based healthcare information systems using an open source cloud platform, OpenStack. The results manifest HIPAA compliance through authorization policies that are capable of addressing vulnerabilities of multi-tenancy.},

  abstract={The implementation of cloud computing in tele-health has enabled enormous benefits of improving health-care services as well as active health approaches, such as Patient-Centered Telehealth (PCT). Applying cloud systems enables healthcare users to obtain medical information from multiple cloud-based platforms or sources. Various service deployments meet different customers' needs. As one of the popular information sharing manners on clouds, Online Self-Diagnosis (OSD) has been widely implemented for recommending medicines or treatment plans in the varied medical fields. However, there is a great risk for users when executing OSD since lack of professional pharmacological knowledge. This paper concentrates on this issue and proposes an ontology-based approach representing the medical knowledge for alarming potential risks. The proposed mechanism is named Secure Ontology-based Self-diagnosis (SOS) Model that is designed to generate knowledge of medical treatments or incompatibility of medicines to avoid improper behaviors of diagnoses. Based on the proposed model, our algorithm uses structure-level technique applying semantic schemas, which is Propositional Satisfiability Matching Algorithm (PSMA). Our experiment has proved the feasibility of our proposed mechanism.},

  abstract={With the increasing use of web services in everyday tasks, we are entering an era of Internet of Services (IoS). Service discovery and selection has become critical issue in the area of web services. Traditional service discovery approaches are often supported by centralized registries that could suffer from single point failure, performance bottleneck, and scalability issues in large scale systems. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a context-aware service discovery and selection approach in a decentralized peer-to-peer environment. In the approach homophily similarity was used for bootstrapping and distribution of nodes. The discovery process is based on the similarity of nodes, previous interaction and behaviour of the nodes, which will help the discovery process in a dynamic environment. Our approach is not only considering service discovery, but also the selection of the best available web service by taking into account the QoS properties of the web services. Experimental results were based on real world semantic web service dataset, the results showed that the approach achieved better performance and efficiency in both discovery and selection processes.},

In this paper we describe our prototype system that uses a Hadoop cluster to extract knowledge from unstructured legal text documents. For this prototype we have considered publicly available SLA/terms of service documents of various cloud providers.

These applications require a variety of features and services, particularly on the management of context. When applications/services lack part or some of these services, they must be consumed from other suppliers who can provide them via a middleware. In addition, due to the changes undergone by the context mean that such services consumed by the ACC must be dynamic; and due to the amount of data involved to define the context, it may require more computation capacity than that provided by a mobile device. For these reason it is necessary the use of the Cloud. In this way, to support these requirements is proposed CARMiCLOC (Context Awareness in Reflective Middleware Cloud Computing), a web-service based middleware, which can behave as a SaaS (Software as a Service) or as a PaaS (Platform as a Service).},

  abstract={The Department of Computer Science at the University of Los Andes has proposed a new curriculum model based on the profile defined by ACM/IEEE, and a pedagogical model based on the "learning by doing" paradigm, in order to ensure a process of self-formation of the student. The knowledge management and the learning process are based on the concept of clouds. The new educational model is based on three clouds: a) the self-formation cloud which is composed of everything related to the student's education (curriculum, etc.); b) the learning paradigm cloud which is related to the paradigms, strategies, forms of assessment, and learning tools; and c) the knowledge sources cloud which is composed of all existing knowledge in the world, in all its forms, from all possible sources. To give support to the educational model, a web platform based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is proposed in this work. The system consists of three management layers; each one manages each one of the clouds described above. The implementation of each layer is made as web services.

  abstract={Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have been playing a dramatically important role in tele-health domains. One of the major benefits of using EHR systems is assisting physicians to gain patients' healthcare information and shorten the process of the medical decision making. However, physicians' inputs still have a great impact on making decisions that cannot be checked by EHR systems. This consequence can be influenced by human behaviors or physicians' knowledge structures. An efficient approach of alerting to the unusual decisions is an urgent requirement for current EHR systems. This paper proposes a schema using ontology in big data to generate an alerting mechanism to assist physicians to make a proper medical diagnosis. The proposed model is Ontology-based EHR Error Prevention Model (OEHR-EPM), which is implemented by a proposed algorithm, Error Prevention Adjustment Algorithm (EPAA). The ontological approach uses Protege to represent the knowledge-based ontology. The proposed schema has been examined by our experiments and the experimental results show that our schema has a higher-level accuracy rate and acceptable operating time performance.},

  abstract={Despite its attractive benefits, cloud adoption is challenged by some criteria of security and privacy. Access Control is one of the traditional and essential security tools of data protection. The decision to grant access to a resource must ensure secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In particular, the challenge is more important with public clouds as many governing authorities could be involved in one cloud scenario. This implies a difficulty to work out which regulation should be applicable in case of conflict. In recent years, many access control models were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their security policies specification and enforcement. In this paper, we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies for the context of public cloud. Throughout the use of ontology tools, we propose an approach for checking privacy enforcement with access control conditions. We also suggest the use of privacy safeguards notification where the threat to privacy protection is related to the secondary usage of personal data more than just the data access itself.},

  abstract={Data collection, storage and manipulation have become more critical due to the growth of magnitude of their misuse or mismanagement impact in business and political scenarios nowadays. While research has pushed technology to deliver more powerful information discovery algorithms, and responsive on-demanding storage and processing capacity through data analysis and distributed cloud infrastructure, concerns about privacy have globally raised several discussions involving different sectors of the society. In particular, individual rights are highly impacted by privacy issues due to nowadays geographic distribution of sensitive information and its discovery. In this work, we present a model for privacy awareness during the data analytics process in a context of scalable computing using the cloud. Our approach addresses privacy issues both in data analytics process and in the infrastructure resource allocation according to privacy regulation in Service Level Agreements (SLA). The proposed model for Privacy-Aware Information Discovery (PAID-M) provides privacy awareness by executing data analytics algorithms encapsulated with privacy preserving techniques. The model also presents how it intends to address the privacy issue in the cloud deployment process by considering differences in privacy regulations and jurisdictions.},

  abstract={One of the open issues in cloud computing is service discovery. Another issue, which has received less attention by practitioners in the cloud computing industry, is service composition based on formal methods, particularly those based on automata and formal languages. In recent years, semantic techniques and cloud ontology have been used to improve the process of finding similar services in the cloud environment. Cloudle, which is the most recent agent-based and semantic-supported search engine in cloud systems, exploits such techniques. Though many models and architectures have been proposed to develop Cloudle, none of them used formal methods for composing services. In this paper, behavior composition, as a formal approach and a sound and complete controller synthesis technique, is adapted to provide a formal approach for resource matching and service composition.},

  abstract={Over the past few years, cloud computing has been more and more attractive as a new computing paradigm due to high flexibility for provisioning on-demand computing resources that are used as services through the Internet. In cloud computing, the unique characteristics in cloud services such as dynamic and diverse services offered at different levels, together with the lack of standardized description languages pose significant challenges for effective cloud service discovery. In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service categories to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching in real environments. Our approach has the capability to automatically identify and categorize cloud services by detecting cloud service concepts from cloud service sources. Initially, we focus on building the cloud service ontology by using NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology). Then, we utilize our cloud service categorization method to investigate cloud service ontology's concepts in a real-world cloud services dataset which contains the metadata of 5,883 real cloud services. After that, we generate cloud service clusters by using cosine similarity to build the cloud service categorization. Our cloud service categorization is helpful in determining whether a given web source is a cloud service. Furthermore, the new web resource which has been categorized as a cloud service can be used to boost knowledge of cloud service categorization cumulatively. The proposed approach is validated by using real-world cloud services available on the World Wide Web and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in cloud service discovery.},

The proposed approach is based on the following assumptions: a) Data graphs are arbitrarily partitioned in the distributed file system is such a way that replication of data triples between the data segments is allowed. b) Data triples are replicated is such a way that answers to a special form of queries, called subject-object star queries, can be obtained from a single data segment. c) Each query posed by the user, can be transformed into a set of subject-object star sub queries. We propose a one and a half phase, scalable, Map-Reduce algorithm that efficiently computes the answers of the initial query by computing and appropriately combining the sub query answers. We prove that, under certain conditions, query can be answered in a single map-reduce phase.},

  pages={1440-1445},
  abstract={In this paper, we design a Hybrid-cloud-based Wheel Manufacturing Service (HC-WMS), aimed at recommending cutting tools with the Ontology inference technology on hybrid cloud platforms for satisfying both the computation scalability and the data safety. On one hand, for the data safety purpose, the wheel manufacturing data are maintained in the private cloud and protected by an authority module. On the other hand, for the computation scalability purpose, the workers which are virtual machines equipped with the wheel manufacturing software are deployed in the public cloud. When a manufacturing job is issued by a user, the job request would be divided into certain manufacturing task requests which are then send to workers through the bulletin board storage. Such the bulletin board storage is designed to exchange data between the public cloud and the private cloud without knowing any cloud information for cloud manufacturing modules, and thus, the burdens of developing manufacturing system are greatly reduced in the hybrid-cloud environment. Finally, we deploy the HC-WMS to a composition of a public cloud, namely Windows Azure, and a private cloud built by using VMWare, and apply the HC-WMS to a wheel manufacturing factory for conducting integrated tests. Testing results show that the HC-WMS can successfully recommend suitable cutting tools for machining jobs, validating its competence of acting as a cloud manufacturing service.},

  abstract={Scientists gain benefits from scalable resource provisioning on-demand, and various computing environments by using cloud computing resources for their applications. However, many cloud computing providers offer their cloud resources according to their own rules. The descriptions of various cloud resources also differ for each vendor. Subsequently, it becomes difficult to find suitable cloud resources given the characteristics of an application. Scientists therefore, select resources used in previous experiments or best performance resources without considering the characteristics of their applications. There is the need to standardize notations to support simple selection of cloud resources without the constraints of providers. Intercloud can use cloud resources without considering cloud providers in hybrid cloud environments. Intercloud project has been studied for interoperability and creates mOSAIC ontology to conceptualize various resources. However, the mOSAIC ontology attributes are limited when considering characteristics of an application. We propose a semantic engine to provide semantic cloud resource services in intercloud environment. We define a rule of categorized resource description with reference to mOSAIC ontology attributes which includes added factors needed to represent application characteristics. We also develop a semantic engine which can choose semantically similar cloud resources using statistical analysis while considering the characteristics of an application. The semantic engine can also classify resources dynamically according to application specifications.},

Access control is an important aspect of cloud computing to enhance the system security. This paper focus on securing the pay-as-you-go model used by cloud service access model (CSAC) using combination of RSA and AES algorithm to ensure that only authorized user access the services from cloud. It also provides the mechanism to detect the conflicts between policies and inhibits the access due to conflicts in the environment of cloud computing. This paper gives an insight into the enhancement of the security to access the services from cloud by proposed access control model. With this aim, this paper presents a secure access control model which allows legal access of services.},

  abstract={As new materials, new technology such as cloud computing and new configurations for the manufacturing enterprise emerge, the distinctions among mechatronics, manufacturing, and service industries become blurred. Consequently, it is expected that the definitions of Industrial Processes become even broader. Outsourcing industrial processes is a common practice and also strategy weapon for many companies to reduce costs and enhance the utilization of internal resources forming core competencies. This paper presents the concept of an industrial product-service system for oil sands mining (om-iPSS) based on the utility enhancement of oil sands mining systems. The intelligent technologies such as the cloud computing are proposed as embedding knowledge in the outsourcing-oriented om-iPSS for the whole life cycle of production process. As a result, the om-iPSS with advanced characteristics such as distributed, intelligence, adaptation and self-organization is developed in which a novel approach for enabling individualized and highly-customized production is proposed. Architecture is proposed to enable the om-iPSS from the aspects of both hardware and software. Key techniques for implementing the architecture are discussed for illustrating the use of the om-iPSS concept.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a framework for Web service migration in Service-oriented Architecture (SOA). The framework utilizes service migration between devices acting as Web service providers to increase the adaptability of SOA in a mobile environment. It allows an automatic discovery of new providers and their services joining a system and extraction of their context, preferences, and rules for a Web service migration ontology. If the preferences and the rules, which specify requirements of each provider to its hosted services and requirements of the services to be hosted by a provider, do not meet the current status and context of providers or services, the framework initiates a Web service migration. In this case, the ontology is added to a core domain model and reasoned together by Jena reasoners to retrieve a set of alternate migration decisions. These are processed by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) decision-making method to find the best possible Web service migrations which modify the status and context of providers and services to better meet their preferences and rules. By the Web service migration, the framework extends significantly the adaptability of SOA systems and helps to keep a required quality of their services (QoS).},

  abstract={Cloud is a set of services and these services are provided to the users on demand. Different providers provide their services to the users through the cloud. With the exponential growth of the cloud services, it has become very difficult for the user to search a required service. Searching becomes still more difficult when user wishes to search a service using its functional properties. The cloud service discovery methods enable users to discover the cloud services based on the user demand. Cloud service discovery is considered as one of the important research areas because of different types and features of cloud providers, their own naming conventions and descriptions. The results of the discovery process can be improved by using a well defined repository. To improve the effectiveness of the discovery, cloud repository requires a good structure to represent the information regarding a cloud service. Information stored in the repository can also be used for selecting the services. In this paper we propose a representational model to store the description of infrastructure services using XML. The proposed data representational model also includes the semantic information.},

The term open learning is used in order to encouraging the development of the concept of Indonesia Open Educational Resources (IOER) and as well as the adoption of concept of cloud computing. There are several phase that we conducted in this research such as analysis, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation phase. The design of the proposed architecture consists of six layers: (1) Infrastructure, (2) Platform, (3) Application, (4) Service, (5) Access, (6) User. As a result of the implementation from this architecture is a prototype of Indonesia - Virtual Open Learning System (iVOLS). In experiment, personalization e-learning runs as a service that need large storage and other shared facilities to conduct the program so the system can delivered different learning materials to different learners. The e-learning personalization in cloud environment classified successful if the learners got the best performance on learning and it shown by their evaluation score. Based on the test results and evaluation showed that the availability on Cloud-Based Open Learning further meet user needs. This is indicated by the presence of a simple infrastructure services, application services with just one stage and the availability of a wider range of data and the resource sharing. In accessibility, Cloud-Based Open Learning provides easy access to the user. By economically, the result of evaluation showed that Cloud-Based Open Learning has an investment of 35.61% efficiency, increase Return On Investment (ROI) of 60.95% and Net Present Value (NPV) of 81.97% from the user's perspective. While from the provider's perspective, Cloud-Based Open Learning has an investment of 200% efficiency, increase Return On Investment (RoI) of 220.4% and Net Present Value (NPV) of 109.55%.},

  abstract={The cloud lock-in problem is commonly addressed by three strategies: (i) use of intermediate layer between cloud services consumers and providers, (ii) use of standardized interfaces to access cloud services, or (iii) use of models with open specifications. This paper evaluated these strategies and concluded that despite the advances they introduced, none of them actually solves the cloud lock-in problem. To address this issue, this paper proposes the use of Semantic Web concepts to avoid cloud lock-in. The strategy consists of using RDF models to specify the features of a cloud service, which are managed by SPARQL queries. The contribution of this paper is fourfold: (i) to evaluate three multi-cloud solutions for the cloud lock-in problem in the context of three cloud platforms, (ii) to propose a strategy using RDF and SPARQL for managing cloud resources, (iii) to present the Cloud Query Manager (CQM), an SPARQL server that implements the proposal, and (vi) to compare three multi-cloud solutions with CQM in terms of response time and the effectiveness in the resolution of the cloud lock-in problem.},

  abstract={This paper describes a cloud-based platform, called RP-SMARF, for supporting research collaboration in the area of smart facilities management. More precisely, the proposed system delivers sophisticated domain-specific services to users by linking together disparate privately-owned elements such as data repositories, specialized hardware resources and specialized software applications into a unified framework. This allows research collaborators within a knowledge domain to easily run complex applications developed by researchers within the domain on complex datasets. Both batch-type processing as well as interactive application access are supported by the platform. The processing of live data streams generated in one site by an application residing in another site can also be performed. An authorization framework allows element owners to precisely control which users can access various elements. RP-SMARF unifies geographically dispersed heterogeneous resources for research collaborators. This simplifies making software created by researchers more usable by other researchers thereby making many researchers more productive.},

  abstract={Porting applications to Clouds is one of the key challenges in software industry. The available approaches to perform this task are basically either services derived from alliances of major software vendors and Cloud providers focusing on their own products, or small platform providers focusing on the most popular software stacks. For migrating other types of software, the options are limited to Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions which require a lot of programming effort for adapting the software to a Cloud provider's API. Moreover, if it must be deployed in different providers, new integration procedures must be designed and implemented which could be a nightmare. This paper presents a solution for facilitating the migration of any application to the cloud, inferring the most suitable deployment model for the application and automatically deploying it in the available Cloud providers.},

  abstract={Cloud services are becoming an essential part of many organizations. Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology.},

  abstract={With the increasing adoption of Cloud Computing, Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) has recently emerged as the delivery of business process outsourcing services that are sourced from the cloud and constructed for multitenancy. BPaaS providers may look for available business processes from other cloud providers to improve their processes. However, today's BPaaS solutions lack an explicit and formal semantics which prevent an easy and dynamic interoperability between different cloud providers. In this paper, we propose firstly to semantically populate a shared knowledge base of process models deployed by BPaaS providers. Therefore, using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve similar process fragments that can be used to design new process variants. We also performed experiments on large public datasets and experimental results show that our approach is feasible and efficient.},

  abstract={The development of Cloud Computing drives the change of value creation towards services and creates a new networked economic structure for challenging organizations to adapt their existing business models. Despite agreement on that the transformation of business model is importance to an organization's success, the evolution of business model enabled by Cloud is still fuzzy and vague within many research fields including both Management Strategy Theory and Information Systems. This paper, following a review of existing works and a series of case studies from several typical industries, employs a deductive reasoning method to investigate the influence of cloud computing on business model evolution and presents a specific service-centric business model. First, the evolution of business model in cloud environment is developed. Second, by analyzing business model innovations on business model nine building blocks in cloud environment, the element of service-centric business model is defined. Then, an ontological framework which includes value, service, and business model dimension for service-centric innovative business model is proposed. Finally, several industrial cases validate that this paper provides a comprehensive framework of organization's business model which can properly reveals an organization's complex nature of business logic and operation management in cloud environment.},

  abstract={In the contemporary cloud computing environment, the various cloud providers adopt different architectures for their systems and usually these are not compatible. The scalable exchange of information about these heterogeneous resources is often not addressed; still this represents an interesting challenge, since different Cloud systems and vendors have different ways to describe and invoke their services, to specify and communicate requirements. Hence a way to provide a common access to Cloud services and to discover and use required services in Cloud federations is highly desirable. The IEEE P2302 Intercloud approach is to define a scalable architecture and to adopt the OMN (Open-Multinet) ontology for supporting its operation. Our work specifically describes the inner workings of the Intercloud system in terms of the Intercloud Federation Application Programmers Interface (API), which are in turn based on the semantic definition of resources, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and Bearer Network Provisioning Metadata.},

  abstract={The numerous heterogeneities among different providers make platform as a service interoperability an interesting and complex research and practical problem. For example, each provider offers its own remote application programming interfaces (APIs). The main aim of this paper is to identify and address service-level interoperability issues when using APIs from different commercial providers of platform as a service. First, we define use case to add current user information from one platform as a service offer to the application hosted on another offer. To address interoperability problems, the ontology driven data mediation will be used and tested in this use case. Remote vendors' APIs are implemented as web services. Resulting web operations and their inputs/outputs are semantically annotated using cross-PaaS concepts from the developed platform as a service OWL ontology. Next, SAWSDL and XSLT are used to define service type mappings. Actual composition of platform as a service APIs is implemented by means of AI planner and developed Java web application. Testing and validation was performed on a case where current Sales force's user is added to data container in Vosao content management system deployed on Google App Engine. Novelty of the paper is a specific application domain (composition of operations defined in PaaS APIs) and new algorithm for identification of interoperability problems.},

  abstract={As the use of services available on the Web is becoming mainstream, contracts and legal aspects of the relationship between providers and consumers need to be formalized. However, current proposals to model service level agreements are mostly focused on technical aspects, do not explicitly provide semantics to agreement terms, and do not follow Web principles. These limitations prevent take-up, automatic processing, and effective sharing of agreements. Linked USDL Agreement is a Linked Data based semantic model to describe and share service agreements that extends Linked USDL, which offers a family of languages to describe various technical and business aspects of services. We followed a use case driven approach, evaluating the applicability of our proposal in a cloud computing scenario, and comparing its expressiveness with existing models. Finally, we show a concrete tool that helps to model and check the validity of agreements.},

  abstract={Learning software agents are able to assist Cloud providers in taking decisions about resource management at any level, as they are able to collect knowledge and improve their performances over time by means of learning strategies. On the other hand Cloud Federations allow providers to share computational infrastructures in order to build a distributed, interoperable multi-cloud context. In this work we present an evolutionary approach based on agent cloning, i.e. a mechanism of agent reproduction allowing providers to substitute an "unsatisfactory" agent acting in a "cloud context" with a clone of an existing agent having a suitable knowledge and a good reputation in the multi-cloud context. By this approach, cloud agents performances can be improved because they are substituted with agent clones that have shown a better behaviour.},

  abstract={Some time passed since the first definitions of Cloud architectures. During the years Cloud systems became more and more complex. The main idea is that all Cloud components offer their functions as a service. For this reason Cloud systems inherits many features from old Web Services and Service Oriented architectures. At the moment, the need for composition and automation of Cloud services is a hot research field. Orchestration is one of the topics that researchers are investigating. Unlike web services, it is not clear what orchestration means in Cloud Systems. It usually addresses automation, but no clear definitions and languages have been provided. Another hot topic regarding composition of cloud services is the definition of design, architectural and communication Patterns for solving well known and common problems. In this work we will show how Orchestration and some Patterns are tightly coupled. We will describe a methodology for definition of orchestrated workflows which exploits some common Cloud Design Patterns in order to verify composition soundness. In addition we will show how this methodology can be used to verify some requirements on the composed Cloud services. The whole methodology is based both on formal semantics definition of an Orchestration language, and on the use of Ontologies for the description of Cloud services interactions.},

  year={2015},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={790-795},
  abstract={This paper proposes a composition-based resource allocation approach to cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). A number of previous proposals have addressed resource allocation for IaaS services with bandwidth guarantee as the main obstacle to accessing datacenter-based cloud resources. Less focus has been put on utilization of hosting resources, i.e. computing and storage. Shortcomings with these proposals (i) may ensue in a high blocking of IaaS requests and (ii) a less efficient use of datacenter resources, which may impact a provider's revenue. In this research paper, a Two-Phase IaaS resource allocation approach (2P-IaaS) is proposed to address these shortcomings: (i) hosting resources mapping phase, and (ii) connectivity composition phase. This approach adopts a semantic ontology model with its associated reasoning capabilities to represent, discover and assign diverse cloud resources to IaaS requests. Furthermore, the proposed approach utilizes semantic similarity and closeness centrality to define an efficient cloud IaaS topology that connects the assigned resources. In this research, experiments on various sets of IaaS requests show significant advantages when compared with selected benchmarks.},

The number and complexity of these regulations is creating significant issues for governance, risk and compliance management especially for heavily-regulated sectors, such as the financial industry. This paper proposes a semantically-enabled compliance management framework that backs up the entire business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design-time verification, runtime and offline monitoring and analysis. In the heart of the framework is an integrated semantic repository incorporating domain, business and regulatory knowledge, at different levels of abstraction, which provides a shared conceptualization of the interrelated compliance and business specifics. Furthermore, given the technological revolution caused by cloud computing, we draw our vision on providing compliance-related ontologies as a service (COaaS) on the cloud. As an initial validation step, we have considered the financial sector with an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) case study and applied our semantic-based approach on.},

  abstract={Advances in the field of cloud computing and networking have led to rapid development and market growth in areas such as online retail, gaming and healthcare. In the field of advanced manufacturing however, the impact has been significantly lesser than expected due to limitations in cloud platforms for fostering community engagement. To address this problem, we study a new cloud-based architecture that provides Platform-asa-Service (PaaS) management capabilities to the manufacturing community for delivering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) “Apps” to their customers. Our architecture aims at supporting an “App Marketplace” that thrives on agile development, organic collaboration and scalable sales of next generation manufacturing Apps requiring high-performance simulation and modeling. Towards realizing the vision of the above architecture, our paper involves investigation and implementation of an Ontology Service that interoperates with other common web services related to resource brokering and accounting. Our Ontology Service uses principles of mapping and merging to translate a manufacturing App's collaboration requirements to suitable resource specifications on public cloud platforms. Integrated resultant ontology can be queried to provision the required resource parameters such as amount of memory/storage, number of processing units, and network protocol configurations needed for deployment of an App. We validate the effectiveness of our Ontology Service using the Protégé framework in a pilot testbed of a real-world “WheelSim” App in the NSF GENI Cloud platform.

  abstract={Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the core technology of Semantic Web and has been more and more popular in recent years. With the rapid growth of the RDF data, the Triple Store, which is the query engine and RDF data storage, requires more scalable and efficient technologies. To improve the scalability and the performance of triple query, which is called SPARQL query processing, Map Reduce programming model and NoSQL database system such as H Base are well-known solutions for large scale data processing. However, in general case, the subject of a triple is regarded as Row Key in the table. In some queries, finding matched triple patterns is a time-consuming job. Therefore, we design another table with different storage schema called Transformed Table to reduce the time cost for read operation. The experimental results show that using Transformed Table can improve the triple query performance significantly.},

  abstract={This position paper describes a framework, i.e. a set of design and architecture recommendations, for achieving agile training. The approach for the design is to be process and data driven, focused on reusability, and borrowing basic principles derived from web-based architectures, semantic processing, user-centered design, composability, complexity management, machine-understandability, scalability, gaming and open linked data. The fundamental features of the framework are open, easily understood, easily implemented, and tool-agnostic. With such a framework defined, the training community could collaborate to build out the more extensive cloud content, extend the capability and ensure that the benefits of agile training are achieved, namely more focused and faster training on shared processes anytime, anywhere at reduced cost and without a large support staff.},

  abstract={In the agricultural domain, the main challenge is to present the new information and research to the farmers so that they can leverage the power of ICT to improve their agricultural practices and thereby the production. Huge amount of agriculture related data like weather data, soil health records, cropping pattern, location specific crop disease and pest are collected from different sources like services, remote satellites, and network of sensors. An agro advisory system presented in this paper helps to bridge the gap between farmers and the agriculture domain experts and developed for the cotton farmers in Gujarat region of India. The system consists of three basic components; Cotton Ontology, Web Services, and Mobile Application Development. The cotton ontology maintains domain knowledge required for answering farmer queries. The ontology contains information regarding crop, soil, cultivation process, disease, pest, and other relevant information. Protégé ontology development tool is used to develop this ontology. Appropriate Web services were built which help interactions with different data sources. The RESTful Web services are programmed in Java using the JAX-RS/Jersey API and the Eclipse EE IDE. The services are developed and deployed on a cloud based application server provided by Heroku. The Web services are invoked from the mobile device and in turn they connect to various data sources like Open Weather API, SQL database and the Ontologies. The farmers can use this application based on very simple android mobile interfaces. The prototype is developed using Java, Android SDK - v14 and Eclipse IDE.},

  abstract={In recent years, cloud environments have emerged as a new paradigm for the execution and the deployment of cost-reduced and optimized business processes. Nevertheless, due to the lack of explicit and formal description of the resource perspective in existing business processes, cloud resources cannot be efficiently and optimally managed. With the aim of formalizing the consumed cloud resources using a shared knowledge base, we propose in this paper a semantic framework for resource-aware business process development in the cloud. Basically, our proposed semantic framework allows for (1) resource description in a formal and unique way, (2) resource allocation management and (3) resource constraints verification. In order to show its feasibility, our approach has been implemented as an extension of Signavio process editor and tested using a real use case study from an industrial partner.},

  pages={785-790},
  abstract={Software as a Service is the most adopted cloud service (46%) compared with Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) (35%) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) (34%) [1]. Currently, the capability of discovering a SaaS of interest online across multiple cloud providers and reviews websites is a significant challenge, especially when using general search mechanisms (Google and Yahoo!) and search tools provided by existing reviews and directories. Discovering a SaaS is time-consuming, requiring consumers to browse several websites to select the appropriate service. This paper addresses the issues related to the efficient discovery of SaaS across review websites by developing the SaaS Nutch Hadoop-based Crawler Engine - SaaS Nhbased Crawler. The crawler is capable of crawling cloud reviews to find SaaSs of interest and enable the establishment of a central repository that could be used to discover SaaSs much more efficiently. The results show that the SaaS Nhbased crawler can effectively crawl review websites and provide a list of the latest SaaS being offered.},

This paper proposes Autonomous Decentralized L3 cache driver based URL filtering system, that uses two knowledge bases and proposal of L3 cache, to achieve low latency with high accuracy. The system creates ontology TDB files in way that most used relationships in ontology are in separate files. Thus the system caches the most frequently used relations of the ontology to minimize the time required by the inference engine of the text categorizer. Evaluation shows L3 cache achieved significant performance improvement in terms of processing time.},

  abstract={Cloud related legal documents, like terms of service or customer agreement are usually managed as plain text files. Hence extensive manual effort is required to monitor the cloud service performance by cross referencing the metrics and measures agreed upon in these documents. We have significantly automated the process of managing and monitoring cloud Service Level Agreements (SLA) using semantic web technologies like OWL, RDF and SPARQL. In this paper, we describe in detail the cloud SLA ontology and the prototype that we have developed to illustrate how the SLA measures can be automatically extracted from legal Terms of Service that are available on cloud provider websites.},

  abstract={Privacy Level Agreements (PLAs) are likely to be increasingly adopted as a standardized way for cloud providers to describe their data protection practices. In this paper we propose an ontology-based model to represent the information disclosed in the agreement to turn it into a means that allows software tools to use and further process that information for different purposes, including automated service offering discovery and comparison. A specific usage of the PLA ontology is presented, showing how to link high level policies to operational policies that are then enforced and monitored. Through this established link, cloud users gain greater assurance that what is expressed in such agreements is actually being met, and thereby can take this information into account when choosing cloud service providers. Furthermore, the created link can be used to enable policy enforcement tools to add semantics to the evidence they produce; this mainly takes the form of logs that are associated with the specific policy of which execution they provide evidence. Furthermore, the use of the ontology model allows a means of enabling interoperability among tools that are in charge of the enforcement and monitoring of possible violations to the terms of the agreement.},

  abstract={The Cloud Computing paradigm has been adopted in countless areas of application and forms the basis of a growing number of business cases. Similar to the situation with service providers in the 1980th, it becomes apparent that different Cloud providers build walled gardens around their offerings. While multiple projects and organizations are working on standards for federating Cloud domains, the scalable exchange of descriptions about heterogeneous resources are often not well considered. Our approach is to adopt both, ideas initially developed for the Internet to define a scalable architecture and concepts from the Semantic Web to define a canonical Intercloud ontology. An initial implementation of the architecture has been developed to form a basis for further refinement of the proposed concepts. As a result, we have defined an initial ontology for Intercloud resources and implemented a catalog for the IEEE Intercloud architecture.},

  abstract={The flexibility demands in manufacturing are severe, e.g., for rapid-change-over to new product variants, while robots are flexible machines that potentially can be adapted to a large variety of production tasks. Task definitions such as explicit robot programs are hardly reusable from an application point-of-view. To improve the situation, a knowledge-based approach exploiting distributed declarative information and cloud computing offers many possibilities for knowledge exchange and reuse, and it has the potential to facilitate new business models for industrial solutions. However, there are many unresolved questions yet, e.g., those related to reliability, consistency, or legal responsibility. To investigate some of these issues, different knowledge-based architectures have been prototyped and evaluated by confronting the solution candidates with key application demands. The conclusion is that distributed cloud-based approaches offer many possibilities, but there is still a need for further research and better infrastructure before this approach can become industrially attractive.},

  abstract={Maintaining security and privacy in the Cloud is a complex task. The task is made even more challenging as the number of vulnerabilities associated with the cloud infrastructure and applications are increasing very rapidly. Understanding the security service level agreements (SSLAs) and privacy policies offered by service and infrastructure providers is critical for consumers to assess the risks of the Cloud before they consider migrating their IT operations to the Cloud. To address these concerns relative to the assessment of security and privacy risks of the Cloud, we have developed ontologies for representing security SLAs (SSLA) in this paper. Our ontologies for SSLAs can be used to understand the security agreements of a provider, to negotiate desired security levels, and to audit the compliance of a provider with respect to federal regulations (such as HIPAA).},

  pages={432-443},
  abstract={The vision of the RoboEarth project is to design a knowledge-based system to provide web and cloud services that can transform a simple robot into an intelligent one. In this work, we describe the RoboEarth semantic mapping system. The semantic map is composed of: 1) an ontology to code the concepts and relations in maps and objects and 2) a SLAM map providing the scene geometry and the object locations with respect to the robot. We propose to ground the terminological knowledge in the robot perceptions by means of the SLAM map of objects. RoboEarth boosts mapping by providing: 1) a subdatabase of object models relevant for the task at hand, obtained by semantic reasoning, which improves recognition by reducing computation and the false positive rate; 2) the sharing of semantic maps between robots; and 3) software as a service to externalize in the cloud the more intensive mapping computations, while meeting the mandatory hard real time constraints of the robot. To demonstrate the RoboEarth cloud mapping system, we investigate two action recipes that embody semantic map building in a simple mobile robot. The first recipe enables semantic map building for a novel environment while exploiting available prior information about the environment. The second recipe searches for a novel object, with the efficiency boosted thanks to the reasoning on a semantically annotated map. Our experimental results demonstrate that, by using RoboEarth cloud services, a simple robot can reliably and efficiently build the semantic maps needed to perform its quotidian tasks. In addition, we show the synergetic relation of the SLAM map of objects that grounds the terminological knowledge coded in the ontology.},
