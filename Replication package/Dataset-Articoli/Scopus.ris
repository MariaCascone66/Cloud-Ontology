AB  - The existing landscape of context-aware mobile applications reveals a significant gap in standardized approaches for knowledge representation, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by intelligence requirements such as automation, dynamism, and intelligent support. To address these critical issues, this study proposes the integration of Semantic-aware Service into Cloud Computing Architecture (SSCCA) as an innovative solution. SSCCA serves as a unified framework designed to empower intelligent context-aware mobile applications by leveraging a foundational cloud service model. By amalgamating principles from Cloud Computing and Semantic Web research, SSCCA aims to facilitate the development of advanced cloud computing applications with built-in intelligence. To validate the efficacy of this novel approach, we present the Smart Context-aware Invoice Platform (SCIP), a sophisticated cloud computing application built upon SSCCA. SCIP is engineered to aggregate personal electronic invoices seamlessly and deliver context-aware mobile services on demand, thereby addressing the pressing need for intelligence-driven solutions in the realm of mobile context-awareness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The practical application of infectious disease emergency plans in mental health institutions during the ongoing pandemic has revealed significant shortcomings. These manifest as chaotic management of mental health care, a lack of hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) knowledge among medical staff, and unskilled practical operation. These factors result in suboptimal decision-making and emergency response execution. Consequently, we have developed a digital-based emergency prevention and control system to reinforce IPC management in psychiatric hospitals and enhance the hospital IPC capabilities of medical staff. Methods: The system incorporates modern technologies such as cloud computing, big data, streaming media, and knowledge graphs. A cloud service platform was established at the PaaS layer using Docker container technology to manage infectious disease emergency-related services. The system provides application services to various users through a Browser/Server Architecture. The system was implemented in a class A tertiary mental health center from March 1st, 2022, to February 28th, 2023. Twelve months of emergency IPC training and education were conducted based on the system. The system’s functions and the users’ IPC capabilities were evaluated. Results: A total of 116 employees participated in using the system. The system performance evaluation indicated that functionality (3.78 ± 0.68), practicality (4.02 ± 0.74), reliability (3.45 ± 0.50), efficiency (4.14 ± 0.69), accuracy (3.36 ± 0.58), and assessability (3.05 ± 0.47) met basic levels (> 3), with efficiency improvement and practicality achieving a good level (> 4). After 12 months of training and study based on the system, the participants demonstrated improved emergency knowledge (χ2 = 37.69, p < 0.001) and skills (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that the digital-based emergency IPC system has the potential to enhance the emergency IPC knowledge base and operational skills of medical personnel in psychiatric hospitals. Furthermore, the medical personnel appear to be better adapted to the system. Consequently, the system has the capacity to facilitate the emergency IPC response of psychiatric institutions to infectious diseases, while simultaneously optimising the training and educational methodologies employed in emergency prevention and control. The promotion and application of this system in psychiatric institutions has the potential to accelerate the digitalisation and intelligence construction of psychiatric hospitals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Spatial technologies examining the cell and tissue microenvironment at near single-cell resolution are revealing important molecular insights. However, few tools enable integrated, interactive analysis of spatial-omics with tissue morphology in the same functional tissue unit. Here, we present FUSION (Functional Unit State Identification in Whole Slide Images), a web-based platform for visualizing and analyzing spatial-omics data with high-resolution histology. FUSION provides workflows for assessing cell compositions, quantitative morphometrics, and comparative tissue analyses. We demonstrate applicability across spatial assays, including 10x Visium, Visium HD, 10x Xenium, Cell DIVE, and PhenoCycler, applied to healthy and diseased tissues from kidney, small intestine, lung, and skin in the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program. FUSION is cloud-based, open-source, and accessible at https://fusion.hubmapconsortium.org/, hosting over 50 paired datasets and tutorials. In a series of use cases, we show its capacity to distinguish renal glomeruli injury states, quantify morphometric changes, and characterize fibrosis with immune infiltration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As cloud computing continues to experience rapid growth, the demand for cloud-native applications is escalating, leading to more complex and diverse development requirements. In this context, automated code generation plays a pivotal role in accelerating cloud-native application development. However, existing studies often overlook the full potential of leveraging multiple program representations, typically focusing on a single form derived from well-structured programs. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating multiple program representations, specifically, code snippets and their associated ASTs can significantly enhance code generation for cloud-native applications. We construct a code knowledge graph (CodeKG) to retrieve related programs based on textual and structural similarities, enabling richer contextual information for generation. To realize this integration, we design a framework that employs shared-retentive networks (shared-RetNet) and an AST-based Transformer to extract and align features from natural language, code tokens, and ASTs. By applying contrastive loss and cross-attention mechanisms, our method effectively fuses diverse modalities to strengthen code generation performance. Experiments on two processed open-source datasets demonstrate that our method, without relying on extensive pre-training, achieves superior results compared to existing pretrained models across BLEU-4, CodeBLEU, and ROUGE-L metrics, paving the way for more efficient and intelligent cloud-native software development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The privacy and security of cloud data have drawn much attention, leading to more data owners outsourcing encrypted data. However, the common practice of encryption can reduce data searchability. Semantic searchable encryption aims to support flexible queries over encrypted data and achieve efficient search while ensuring that search results match the user's search intent. Although semantic searchable encryption schemes have made progress, they still have limitations in properly balancing accuracy, efficiency, and security. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Enhanced Semantic Searchable Encryption (CESSE) scheme to achieve accurate and highly efficient secure semantic search over encrypted cloud data. To achieve it, we first adopt a context-enhanced pre-trained model component to mine the relevance between queries and documents by contrastive learning and obtain context-enhanced vector representations to improve search accuracy. Then, to ensure privacy protection, we utilize an optimized asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryption (optimized ASPE) algorithm to encrypt vectors before outsourcing to the cloud. Additionally, we construct the approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) index to accelerate vector searching. At last, we give a formal definition of security and theoretically prove the safety of our scheme under a more practical threat model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CESSE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better accuracy and efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to address the core issues of vocational education in the current cloud computing environment, such as the curriculum system lagging behind technological development and the lack of dynamic data support for talent skill assessment. It aims to build a digital education mechanism and system platform based on cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology, and achieve accurate matching of vocational education with industry needs by establishing an education model of "data-driven-intelligent adaptation-dynamic feedback". First, crawler technology is used to integrate 46,000 cloud computing job recruitment data and 32 vocational college teaching data to construct a job capability knowledge graph; secondly, learner portraits are classified based on the K-means clustering algorithm, and a dynamic evaluation system containing 8 dimensions and 64 indicators is established; then a system architecture with three core functions of intelligent course recommendation, virtual training environment, and real-time capability assessment is designed, and an LSTM neural network is introduced for learning behavior prediction. Within a 12-month period of three pilot colleges, the system enables learners to achieve a job adaptation rate of 85.2%, a mean resource allocation delay of 9.24ms, and an employment rate of 92.5%, which verifies the remarkable effect of this mechanism in improving the adaptability of vocational education and provides a replicable technical path for vocational education reform under the background of digital transformation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The semantic segmentation is a critical task in LiDAR point cloud processing. Leveraging temporal information to provide contextual data for regions with low visibility or sparse observations has recently become a popular research direction, especially in autonomous driving. Existing methods, however, are often over-reliant on past frames, leading to cumulative errors (drift) caused by unconstrained frame-by-frame stacking. This paper proposes a dynamic alignment of historical frame memory information to ensure consistency with the observations of the current frame, reducing deviations caused by viewpoint changes or object movements and ensuring more accurate capture of current frame features. In addition, a new multi-scale feature fusion method, to the best of our knowledge, was introduced using the spatiotemporal (ST) method to extract the ST features, which reduces the inconsistencies between 2D range image coordinates and 3D Cartesian outputs. This approach enhances feature representation by optimizing and fusing the aligned channel features. This method was evaluated on the SemanticKITTI and SensatUrban datasets. The experimental results showed that it outperforms existing state-ofthe- art methods regarding accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the cloud-based product form design process, traditional collaborative-filtering recommendation methods fail to effectively calculate similarity metrics or generate relevant knowledge recommendations for newly joined designers, due to their lack of historical knowledge scores, resulting in inefficient knowledge acquisition. Since designers show a clear tendency of professional trust in the knowledge adoption process, they are more inclined to accept knowledge resources recommended by people with similar professional backgrounds to theirs or by authorities in their fields. Therefore, this paper proposes a knowledge recommendation method for product form design integrating crowd-intelligence context similarity and trust relationships in cloud environments. The method first constructs an ontology model and a product form design knowledge ontology, containing task context, designer’s context, and computational context to facilitate the acquisition, storage, processing, and invocation of contextual information and knowledge. Second, the neighboring set of target designers is determined by calculating the multidimensional contextual similarity and trust relationship between designers. Finally, the missing knowledge score of the target designer is predicted by the knowledge evaluation of the neighboring designers, and the recommendation list is generated. The method’s effectiveness and feasibility are confirmed through a case study of coffee machine product form design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Trusted Research Environments (TREs) are increasingly used as platforms for secure health data research, but they can also be used for implementing research findings or for action-research (researchers supporting health professionals to solve problems with advanced data analytics). Most TREs have been designed to support analysis of well-structured and coded data, however, with much clinical data recorded as unstructured notes, especially in mental health care, there needs to be a greater variety of tools and data management services available for safe research that includes natural language processing and anonymisation of data sources. The Mental Health Research for Innovation Centre (M-RIC), co-hosted by the University of Liverpool and Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, has implemented a novel TRE design that incorporates modern data engineering concepts to improve how researchers access a wider variety of linked data and machine learning tools, to be able to both undertake research and then deploy these tools directly into mental health care. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper addresses information transmission security issues within cloud computing security management platforms. Focusing on the symmetric encryption algorithm, it proposes a cloud computing data security transmission system, followed by model validation and simulation analysis. The key findings are as follows: (1) The use of a symmetric encryption algorithm ensures both user data security and the secure distribution of encryption keys. (2) The proposed encryption algorithm effectively conceals the distribution characteristics of explicit data, enhancing the information transmission security of the ship communication network. (3) The joint robust optimization algorithm outperforms other benchmark methods in terms of average safety rate. (4) The maximum speed between sampling nodes is calculated, revealing a speed difference of 0.3km/h between the embedded data and the original data. The average speed difference is 0.001km/h, with a speed change rate of only 0.01%. These results indicate that the algorithm proposed in this paper provides high secrecy and a large hidden capacity, making it suitable for secure information transmission in vehicle-to-network communications and from roadside intelligent facilities to cloud servers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The widespread use of point clouds has spurred the rapid development of neural networks for point cloud processing. A crucial property of these networks is maintaining consistent output results under random rotations of the input point cloud, namely, rotation invariance. The dominant approach achieves rotation invariance is to construct local coordinate systems for computing invariant local point cloud coordinates. However, this method neglects the relative pose relationships between local point cloud structures, leading to a decline in network performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Rotation-Invariant Point Cloud Transformer (RotInv-PCT). This method extracts the local abstract shape features of the point cloud using Local Reference Frames (LRFs) and explicitly computes the spatial relative pose features between local point clouds, both of which are proven to be rotation-invariant. Furthermore, to capture the long-range pose dependencies between points, we introduce an innovative Feature Aggregation Transformer (FAT) model, which seamlessly fuses the pose features with the shape features to obtain a globally rotation-invariant representation. Moreover, to manage large-scale point clouds, we utilize hierarchical random downsampling to gradually decrease the scale of point clouds, followed by feature aggregation through FAT. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RotInv-PCT, we conducted comparative experiments across various tasks and datasets, including point cloud classification on ScanObjectNN and ModelNet40, part segmentation on ShapeNet, and semantic segmentation on S3DIS and KITTI. Thanks to our provable rotation-invariant features and FAT, our method generally outperforms state-of-the-art networks. In particular, we highlight that RotInv-PCT achieved a 2% improvement in real-world point cloud classification tasks compared to the strongest baseline. Furthermore, in the semantic segmentation task, we improved the performance on the S3DIS dataset by 10% and, for the first time, realized rotation-invariant point cloud semantic segmentation on the KITTI dataset. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In light of the growing significance of data privacy in cloud computing, searchable encryption has emerged as a prominent area of research in recent years. Given that the majority of achievements are only concentrated on keyword-based search, there is a clear need to explore secure semantic extension to enhance the utilization of information. Nevertheless, majority of secure semantic schemes mainly focus on the direct combination of traditional searchable encryption and semantic extension techniques, which results in the high computation and communication overheads for multi-keyword queries. Besides, to enhance the flexibility and extensibility of secure semantic search, some researchers have already proposed encryption methods for structured data. However, the effectiveness and practicality of these methods above are often limited by their rigid structure description and redundant index building. To handle these problems, we present a secure sublinear semantic search scheme based on the knowledge graph, which can achieve sublinear knowledge graph (KG) search and smart sentence queries concurrently. The knowledge graph encryption index is constructed with the same structure as the inverted index, thereby enabling sublinear efficiency. Furthermore, the system also offers functions for both node and edge semantic extension in the knowledge graph. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is adaptively secure and present a series of experiments to analyze its performance. The experimental results show that our scheme exhibits significant advantages in all computation, communication and expression situations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing presents itself as one of the leading technologies in the IT solutions field, providing a variety of services and capabilities. Meanwhile, blockchain-based solutions emerge as advantageous as they permit data immutability, transaction efficiency, transparency, and trust due to decentralization and the use of smart contracts. In this paper, we are consolidating these two technologies into a secure framework for access control in cloud environments. A cross-chain-based methodology is used, in which transactions and interactions between multiple blockchains and cloud computing systems are supported, such that no separate third-party certificates are required in the authentication and authorization processes. This paper presents a cross-chain-based framework that integrates a full, fine-grained, attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanism that evaluates cloud user access transaction attributes. It grants or denies access to the cloud resources by inferring knowledge about the attributes received using semantic reasoning based on ontologies, resulting in a more reliable method for information sharing over the cloud network. Our implemented cross-chain framework on the Cosmos ecosystem with the integrated semantic ABAC scored an overall access control (AC) processing time of 9.72 ms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The internet of vehicles (IoV) connects vehicles, infrastructure, and users, generating a large amount of sensitive data that requires strong privacy protection. To address the limitations of traditional keyword-based exact search methods, this paper proposes an efficient encrypted semantic search method for IoV. The method introduces an encrypted search architecture that combines edge and cloud computing to achieve low-latency processing and high-capacity storage. An encrypted knowledge graph-based semantic search (EKGSS) method is developed to combine symmetric encryption with knowledge graphs to achieve privacy-preserving and semantically relevant content retrieval. Experiment results show that EKGSS improves precision by 3.2% and recall by 36% while ensuring data privacy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN’s), the part of the cloud computing environment, are equipped with several applications and are susceptible to attacks by intruders. Existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) are able to identify simple attacks instead of complex attacks. Complex attacks comprise multiple forms of attacks that can only be identified through reasoning and maintaining relationships between sensor nodes and patrol nodes in the network. Therefore, the given paper proposes a smart knowledge-based framework to detect intrusions in the given network with the use of ontology. The proposed framework begins with the capturing of live network packets, followed by the construction of ‘NETWORK TRAFFIC Ontology’ in order to represent the relationship between the captured packets and attributes associated with several nodes. The designed ontology serves as a knowledge base comprising a set of classes, properties, and instances in the context of packets captured from autonomous cloud computing environment. After this, the features from the designed ontology are extracted using semantic web rule language (SWRL) and Pellet reasoner. It is used to identify intrusion in the form of malicious packets in the network. Lastly, the performance of the proposed framework is validated against recent studies based on evaluation metrics such as attack estimation rate (AER), accuracy (%), and false alarm rate (FAR). The results show that the proposed framework outperforms the recent studies in terms of performance metrics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid advancement of financial technology (FinTech) has led to the integration of advanced technologies like data science, blockchain, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. However, trust evaluation remains a critical challenge in dynamic landscape. Existing trust evaluation methods often neglect key aspects of timeliness, reliability, and non-invasiveness, leading to imprecise trust assessments and insufficient detection of malicious user behavior. This paper introduces a robust four-layer architectural framework with the blockchain layer, edge computing service layer, cloud computing service layer, and terminal user application layer leveraging blockchain technology for authentication and trust evaluation. Blockchain technology transforms FinTech data into linked data, ensuring data security and decentralization during information transfers. A novel hybrid consensus protocol combining Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) and Proof of Stake (PoS) is introduced to enhance the efficiency and security of the blockchain. Extensive simulation experiments have demonstrated significant improvements in data security, reliability, and accuracy of trust assessments compared to existing methods. This paper presents a comprehensive solution for enhancing trust evaluation in FinTech, emphasizing timeliness, reliability, and non-invasiveness of assessments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is cementing its presence in IT strategies and CIOs’ priorities across industries. Companies have been heavily adopting different cloud services and integrating them into their IT portfolios. Meanwhile, research has been striving to understand, articulate, and explore the cloud ecosystem. Using 13 expert interviews and 3 case studies, and while applying transaction costs theories, this research contributes to the explicitness of cloud computing. This paper introduces a new concept, that should be added to existing cloud computing ontologies: Meta-Services. The paper provides a working definition for cloud Meta-Services and explains their inter-relationships with other cloud services and available ontologies. It also discusses four examples of Meta-Services that emerge during the cloud adoption journey. This discussion and conceptualization of Meta-Services will help cloud customers make more informed decisions about their entire cloud adoption journey. It will also help cloud providers make more realistic promises to their customers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Premna puberula Pamp. is a plant with similarities to both food and medicine, which has attracted the attention of researchers because of the rich pectin in its leaves. However, the mechanism of efficient pectin accumulation remains unclear. Through transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, this study investigated the differentially expressed genes and proteins associated with pectin during various developmental stages of P. puberula. The combined omics approach revealed that the majority of differential genes are mainly involved in the anabolic metabolism of primary and secondary metabolites. Notable differential pathways include starch and sucrose metabolism, amino acid sugar metabolism, and nucleotide sugar metabolism. The SWEET gene family was identified and analyzed, leading to the cloning of PpSWEET15 and subcellular localization. Overexpression of PpSWEET15 resulted in a significant decrease in sucrose content in leaves from 134.44 μg·g−1 to <10 μg·g−1. Glucose content decreased from 407.75 μg·g−1 to 318.38 μg·g−1, while fructose levels showed no significant difference between the two groups of leaves. This comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic analysis provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficient accumulation of pectin in P. puberula. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of the rapid development of service-oriented computing and cloud computing, selecting the service that meets the user’s needs from an ever-increasing number of Web services is always challenging. Exploiting auxiliary information such as a Knowledge Graph (KG) can significantly improve the effectiveness of service recommendations. However, current KG-based service recommendation methods usually merely integrate the knowledge semantic information into the user-service interaction model, which ignores the importance of global structure and does not fully consider the in-depth learning of individual user preferences. To this end, this paper proposes a Multi-Level View Contrastive Learning for Service Recommendation (MCSR) approach to address the above challenges. In particular, unlike traditional approaches that consider only two views, we consider three views, i.e., the global structure view, the local collaboration view, and the semantic view. Specifically, the user-service graph is regarded as the collaboration view, the service-entity graph as the semantic view, and the user-service-entity graph as the structural view. By applying contrastive learning across these views at different levels, MCSR fully leverages graph features and structural information, integrating auxiliary relational semantics into user-service interaction modeling. Furthermore, recognizing that the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly improving recommendation accuracy., since the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy. The experimental results show that MCSR significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, with the positive impact of its key components on the recommended performance verified by ablation experiments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Because more people need scalable and private Large Language Model (LLM) processing in the cloud, better orchestration methods for using different cloud resources are required. This research proposes a new architecture for handling Multi-Cloud Semantic Orchestration of AI-driven data pipelines to make LLM inference workflows more efficient, secure and in line with company policies. The framework makes it possible to effectively assign tasks and control data with the help of ontology-based knowledge graphs and added metadata by semantic enrichment. Our system uses distributed coordination engines, ensures both differential privacy and secure multiparty computation and selects appropriate models for proper latency, throughput and compliance. Experimental findings from using well-known NLP datasets show that the orchestration strategy proposed here reduces latency by up to 38% and ensures more privacy by 22% than standard single-cloud systems. This research supports better LLM operations (LLMOps) in areas like healthcare and finance, since both need to pay close attention to data protection and privacy laws. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing need for secure and transparent data management in educational institutions has brought attention to Blockchain technology. This study explores the implementation of Blockchain for educational data integrity, focusing on how decentralized ledger technologies (DLTs) and Merkle root methods enhance trust, transparency, and security in academic environments. By integrating an ontology-based framework, this research provides a structured approach to organizing and verifying digital credentials, student records, and institutional data. The ontology aids in reducing conceptual ambiguity and supports interoperability among diverse educational technologies. Through technical analysis of Blockchain components, such as Merkle trees, cryptographic hashes, and block structures, the study demonstrates how Blockchain ensures tamper-proof and verifiable data transactions. Case studies from universities applying Blockchain-Based certification further highlight the feasibility and challenges of adoption, including infrastructure readiness, stakeholder resistance, and integration with legacy systems. The findings suggest that combining Blockchain with emerging technologies like AI and cloud computing can establish a resilient, scalable, and secure educational ecosystem. This paper contributes a theoretical and practical perspective for institutions aiming to modernize academic record keeping while addressing privacy, authenticity, and long-term data sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Web shell detection has become increasingly crucial with the expansion of cloud computing, where automated malware analysis serves as a foundational approach. A key challenge in malware detection lies in balancing the reduction of false positives with maintaining detection accuracy amid rapid software ecosystem evolution. Existing methods require substantial expert intervention to mitigate false positives and often neglect the resource-intensive measures required to address model degradation caused by software updates. This study introduces ASTBAR, a novel method that extracts fine-grained AST fragments to distill benign behavioral knowledge from webserver software. By leveraging program structure and semantic analysis, ASTBAR generates fragment-level representations of benign samples and employs fragment matching to identify malware. Unlike prior techniques, ASTBAR achieves simultaneous improvements in precision, recall, and adaptability to software evolution. The evaluation results demonstrate that ASTBAR achieves an F1 score of 65.35%, outperforming the state-of-theart methods by 10.39%. In a12-month industrial deployment spanning over one million users, ASTBAR maintained a 97.63% recall rat while reducing false positives by 700+ cases daily (equivalent to 30 expert hours). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing (CC) has the potential to augment collaboration, scalability, and accessibility, while providing cost-saving opportunities via enhanced and efficient computing, thus enabling enterprises to maintain focus. Cloud-based security ontologies are organized frameworks that delineate and classify topics pertinent to security in CC settings. They assist in standardizing language and enhance communication, interoperability, and comprehension among diverse stakeholders, including security experts, developers, and organizations. The ontology-based security strategy is one of the security solutions used by relevant parties. Nevertheless, target customers and cloud service providers see it as complex and lacking in security, since the applicable paradigms for various contexts are not clearly defined. Previous research has identified many security ideas that service providers might use, employing several evaluation methodologies. This highlights the growing need for reviewing the literature on Cloud Security Ontology (CSO). This research outlines the current state of the art in cloud computing ontology (CCO) and conducts a comprehensive literature review on the topic. Using the systematic literature review (SLR) approach, we identified 100 papers; 60 were selected based on established criteria, and 25 were assessed to be pertinent to the study. Scholars have shown active interest in four main areas of CC - service description, cloud security (CS), cloud resource management, cloud interoperability, and cloud service discovery - where cloud ontologies have had a significant impact. According to the research, fifteen of the thirty-one methods described in the literature for using ontologies in the cloud domain are still in use in legacy computing settings. The findings reveal several issues with improving company operations in cloud and multi-cloud settings via the use of ontologies. This paper delineates unsolved difficulties and potential future paths for academics in cloud ontology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid adoption of cloud computing has revolutionized data management worldwide, offering unmatched flexibility, significant cost savings, and seamless scalability. However, this transformation also introduces a host of security challenges data theft, denial-of-service attacks, insider threats, misconfiguration errors, and malware infections all of which expose the limitations of traditional security approaches. This study explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can strengthen cloud security by leveraging machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, predictive analytics, and automated incident response. To create a well-structured understanding of the intricate connections between security threats, AI-driven solutions, and protection strategies, an ontology has been incorporated into the proposed model. This integration not only enhances issue identification but also improves the assessment of AI-based defense mechanisms, leading to practical and effective security recommendations. By enabling early risk detection, swift attack responses, and reinforced data protection, this approach ensures a more resilient and secure cloud environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In fully managed serverless environments, cloud service providers handle the underlying infrastructure, reducing application developers' operational and maintenance efforts. However, these environments limit the use of traditional cybersecurity frameworks and tools, compromising observability and situational awareness capabilities for security tasks (e.g., risk assessment, incident response). Additionally, existing security frameworks for serverless applications often lack generalizability across architectures and require specialized expertise. In this paper, we propose a three-layer security stack for fully managed serverless applications. The first layer establishes a foundational generic ontology that models serverless application resources and their interactions using API logs. In the second layer, the ontology is leveraged via perimeterless pipeline, to map the logs into a unified application activity KG, and in the third layer, two situational awareness tools that utilize the graph-based representation are implemented: (1) an incident response dashboard that leverages the ontology to visualize and examine application activity logs in the context of cybersecurity alerts; our user study showed that this dashboard enabled participants to respond 10% more accurately and almost twice as fast than the examined baseline tool, and (2) a criticality of asset (CoA) risk assessment framework that enables efficient expert-based prioritization in cybersecurity contexts; our expert-based questionnaire demonstrated strong agreement, achieving a Kendall-W score of 0.7179. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has revolutionized the IT landscape, offering scalable and cost-efficient solutions for data storage and access. In recent years, multi-cloud environments have emerged as a strategic approach to leverage the strengths of various cloud service providers, mitigating vendor lock-in risks and optimizing performance. In the paper, we propose an improved ontological model to formalize the domain's concepts and relationships. This comprehensive strategic approach aims to enhance data management practices automation and facilitate informed decision-making in multi-cloud environments. The main idea focuses on combining a two scaling mechanism together in the same time. The paper focuses on scaling of containerized applications in Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) on the AWS platform using Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler (KCA) and Auto Scaling Group (ASG). Theoretical provisions are supported by experimental studies. Simulations were conducted that included automatically adding and removing EC2 instances running ASG and comparing the results to other scaling methods. The results provide insight into the effectiveness of ASG in combination with Cluster Autoscaler to provide performance indicators, stability and cost of scaling in various load servicing scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

In recent years, multi-cloud environments have emerged as a strategic approach to leverage the strengths of various cloud service providers, mitigating vendor lock-in risks and optimizing performance. This paper focuses on the research domain of cloud computing, with a specific emphasis on data storage and access in multi-cloud environments. The importance of this research lies in its significant implications for data security, scalability, cost optimization, and resource management, due to the lack of versatility of the existing multi-cloud frameworks and approaches these concepts. The paper highlights key scientific goals, such as designing distributed storage techniques, optimizing data access latency, and developing security frameworks to safeguard data in multi-cloud settings according to the selected requirements of the subject are. Therefore, we propose an ontological model to formalize the domain’s concepts, relationships, and properties, while introducing an optimization function for selecting the best public cloud provider based on the proposed features.

AB  - With the rapid development of cloud computing and service computing, service recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping users efficiently filter the appropriate services. However, the sparsity of service data and the presence of noise in interactions make it extremely challenging to accurately capture user preferences. Existing service recommendation methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily rely on ID aggregation, often neglecting the richness of textual semantics and are susceptible to interaction noise, resulting in suboptimal modeling of user-service relationships. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable advantages in capturing textual semantics, current methods struggle to effectively align structural representations with textual representations, limiting improvements in recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-semantic graph diffusion model for service recommendation, DiffMSR, which aims to align textual and structural representations while learning the generation process of interaction graphs in a denoising manner. This approach mitigates data sparsity and effectively reduces noise interference. Specifically, the model leverages LLMs to capture the textual semantic features of service descriptions and integrates them with structured semantic information from knowledge graphs. Through cross-semantic contrastive learning, it achieves heterogeneous semantic alignment. Furthermore, the model introduces a multisemantic diffusion-based generation framework, which iteratively denoises to construct high-quality user-service interaction graphs. This significantly enhances the multi-semantic awareness of user representations, thereby improving recommendation performance. Experiments on public service datasets demonstrate that DiffMSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving improvements of 4.13% and 6.37% in recommendation accuracy and recall, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

These marketplaces, led by major providers such as Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud, feature services exclusively available on their own platforms, introducing limitations for end users. This paper explores the convergence of cloud computing, blockchain, and semantics, envisioning a marketplace where cloud providers can offer their cloud services and cloud consumers can efficiently discover, procure, and potentially resell these services. Semantic representations streamline service discovery and composition, enhancing interoperability. Blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens play pivotal roles in establishing a fully decentralized marketplace characterized by data verification and immutability. This enables autonomous contract validation and execution between cloud consumers and cloud providers, reducing reliance on intermediaries. This innovative fusion promises to reshape the landscape of cloud service procurement, making it more transparent and independent. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As cloud computing and mobile work blur traditional network boundaries, security measures like static firewalls and signature-based systems are becoming inadequate. Audit logs contain fine-grained OS-level information, but due to their vast volume and the complex relationships between entities, processing and analyzing them remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce MPKAN, a new method for detecting APT attacks, which enhances the information input of nodes and edges, integrates node-level and edge-level information, and improves graph-level semantics. It uses meta-path random walks to enhance semantic connections between nodes, merges multiple edges in the provenance graph into a single edge while retaining the original edge information and operation sequence relationships, and by associating heterogeneous graph neighbors, utilizing the message passing mechanism to iteratively update states based on neighbor node information, and using a knowledge association network to integrate node-level and edge-level information, we can effectively capture local and global structural information in the graph. MPKAN's evaluations on the ATLAS and Darpa datasets demonstrate its excellent performance in complex attack scenarios, achieving an average accuracy of 0.9899 and an F1 score of 0.9853, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fault injection ensures the resilience of cloud-edge computing systems. System observability for conducting effective and comprehensive fault injection experiments must be enhanced, particularly due to the complex and distributed architectures of cloud-edge environments, where a single failure can trigger cascading effects, creating a dynamic and expanding fault blast radius. Additionally, accurate fault diagnosis becomes even more challenging when multiple teams simultaneously inject faults into interdependent components, highlighting the need for collaborative fault injection rather than confounding concurrent activities. This work addresses these challenges by proposing a collaborative fault injection framework powered by knowledge graph technologies. The framework enhances collaboration by enabling teams to seamlessly synchronize fault injection experiments within a shared environment. By extracting dynamic fault blast radius information from the proposed fault observation knowledge graph after fault injection, the system observability is improved and more efficient fault injection experiments are ensured. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we use an evolutionary game theory model to analyze the dynamic interactions among stakeholders. Utilizing a simulated OpenStack platform as our testbed, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional fault injection techniques, achieving a remarkable 42.76% reduction in the average time required to observe the complete fault blast radius. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - End-cloud collaboration offers a promising strategy to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) in DNN inference by offloading portions of the inference workload from end devices to cloud servers. Despite the potential, the complex model architectures and dynamic network conditions will introduce numerous bubbles (i.e., idle waiting time) in pipeline execution, resulting in inefficient resource utilization and degraded QoS. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named COACH, designed for near bubble-free pipeline collaborative inference, thereby achieving low inference latency and high system throughput. Initially, COACH employs an offline component that utilizes an efficient recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm to optimize both model partitioning and transmission quantization, aiming to minimize the occurrence of pipeline bubbles. Subsequently, the online component in COACH employs an adaptive quantization adjustment and a context-aware caching strategy to further stabilize pipeline execution. Specifically, COACH analyzes the correlation between intermediate data and label semantic centers in the cache, along with its influence on the quantization adjustment, thereby effectively accommodating network fluctuations. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of COACH in reducing inference latency and enhancing system throughput. Notably, while maintaining comparable accuracy, COACH achieves up to 1.7× faster inference and 2.1× higher system throughput than baselines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - International students and job seekers need assessments of credential equivalence between nations and learning institutions to enter educational programs worldwide. Current manual assessment methods, such as educational equivalency, operate at a slow pace and rely on unreliable methods, which limits their potential for widespread adoption. Study results indicate Word Mover's Distance (WMD) developed within Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers the most effective solution for analyzing the meaning of academic qualifications. When use WMD analysis on course descriptions and learning outcomes, it may get better contextual equivalence assessment methods that fix problems with older assessment methods. The recommended system implements WMD technology for automatic equivalence assessment through cloud infrastructure processing. The recommended system integrates cloud computing benefits and computational capabilities to manage large quantities of information and perform thorough semantic evaluations. Multiple course description datasets from different institutions examine the effectiveness of WMD against known similarity measurements such as cosine and Jaccard similarity. According to the study, WMD is better at finding similar courses because it uses contextual connections between different course sections. Using both developed heatmaps and semantic embeddings together makes it easier to see outcome data because they show the same information in ways that are easy to understand. The worldwide business sector benefits from cloud computing, which delivers adaptive system frameworks together with real-time computing operations throughout expandable resources that users at any location can reach. The system creates a full automated way to compare credentials by combining educational outcomes with employee requirements and academic standards around the world. According to research, cloud platforms based on natural language processing can set up objective structured systems that help countries work together on education and the workforce. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has become necessary to current undertakings, however the intricacy of cloud conditions presents critical difficulties in overseeing and keeping up with framework execution. Abnormalities in asset use, like equipment disappointments or misconfigurations, can prompt extreme execution debasement and administration disturbances. Customary irregularity location techniques frequently miss the mark in addressing these difficulties because of high misleading positive rates and restricted adaptability. This paper presents an original structure that coordinates semantic examination with deep learning, explicitly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to improve the recognition of peculiarities in cloud conditions. By consolidating application semantics, our structure limits the extent of identification, decreasing computational above and further developing exactness. The RNN model is prepared on semantically labeled asset utilization information, permitting it to perceive typical examples and recognize deviations continuously. Exploratory outcomes, led by Apache Cassandra and MongoDB inside a cloud-based framework, show the viability of this methodology, accomplishing an identification precision of 98.3%. The framework likewise shows a 90% decrease in bogus up-sides and total disposal of misleading negatives in the wake of consolidating client criticism. These outcomes recommend that our structure can essentially further develop cloud unwavering quality, making it an important instrument for proactive cloud management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The selection of Software as a Service (SaaS) in cloud computing relies on providers’ ability to semantically describe the non-functional properties of their services and the non-functional requirements specified by customers. In this work, we model the SaaS selection process as a multi-criteria NP-hard optimization problem. To solve this, we propose a hybrid approach that employs a genetic algorithm, leveraging semantically described micro SaaS services using an ontology. Each micro SaaS is stored alongside compatible SaaS offerings with the same functionality within a single cloud, based on the concept of compatibility. While a single micro SaaS may not fulfill all functional requirements in some cases, a composition of multiple SaaS(s), termed virtual SaaS, can meet the customer’s needs. The selected SaaS must be optimal according to the customer’s specified criteria. The proposed multi-criteria approach integrates a QoS ontology tailored to cloud environments. Simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently enables significant SaaS selection within a cloud environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As an efficient characterization paradigm for 3D scene understanding, point clouds have been widely used in computer vision and robot perception. However, its unstructured nature is susceptible to noise interference, occlusion, density and scale variation problems, and there are challenges such as feature loss and boundary geometry distortion. To this end, this study proposes ASCFNet, a hierarchical point cloud network based on adaptive sampling and cross-domain feature interaction. the multi-scale adaptive sampling module (MAS) implements a dynamic sampling strategy that fuses local features with global information through the Gumbel-softmax function. Cross-domain feature interaction module (CFI), which employs a dual mechanism of intersection fusion and local context aggregation to enhance the learning ability of boundary features. Symmetric Feature Propagation Architecture (SFPA), which effectively suppresses feature bias in the traditional up-sampling process through consistency constraints in the encoding-decoding path. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40 and S3DIS show that the method achieves an average accuracy of 92.5% in the classification task (1.1% improvement over the benchmark model) and 74.4% mIoU in the semantic segmentation task, which validates the advantages of the framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid growth of surveillance video challenges traditional cloud computing with high bandwidth costs and transmission delays, while edge computing’s limited resources hinder efficient processing. Surveillance video analytics face unique challenges, including substantial content redundancy, varying inference complexity across frames, and strict real-time processing requirements. To address these issues, we propose CSVA, an efficient Complexity-driven and Semantic-aware Video Analytics approach leveraging edge-cloud collaboration.

AB  - Penetration of malware in mobile devices causes loss of information or theft of mobile data. Today, various methods have been proposed to malware detection in Cloud computing. In this paper, a semantic autonomous intrusion detection system (SAutoIDS) based on the ontology and cellular automata (CLA) and group method of data handling deep neural network (GMDH-DNN) is proposed to malware detection. The Semantic Multi-Level Approach (SMLA) processes of the data and transformed into semantic values based on a semantic level. The ontology method selects optimal features from malware data. Then the semantic data are divided into training and testing samples. Training data are implemented to the GMDH-DNN for creating the model and CLA to optimize the GMDH model. Finally, testing data are entered into the optimized GMDH model and malwares are detected. We have used CICMaldroid2020, malicious, ArvindMahindru66 and Android Applications dataset to evaluate the SAutoIDS. By implementing the SAutoIDS, it was observed that the accuracy improved by 1.1% compared to other methods MAFF, Federation, Machine learning and De-LADY Method. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The digital age has promoted the growth of the demand for a large number of computing resources, and the computing power network was born. Through distributed architecture, the computing power network can cover clouds, edges, and terminals to meet different levels of computing needs. Then, in reality, the network resources are complex, and there are many high-concurrent transmission tasks in the computing network. The OSPF routing algorithm adopted in the traditional network only supports multiple transmission tasks to seize the bandwidth resources of a single link, so it is difficult for users to flexibly choose computing resources according to the task requirements. Therefore, in order to achieve the heterogeneity of network resources, we propose a cross-network fusion scheduling mechanism for high-concurrent transmission tasks in the computing network. By sensing the performance parameters of multi-link heterogeneous networks, we assign a link with relatively abundant bandwidth and relatively short time to complete all transmission tasks to the new task flow for transmission, so as to ensure the bandwidth demand of high concurrent transmission tasks. Finally, the test results show that this method can make full use of network resources, and the throughput of each task flow is improved by more than 100 Mbps, and the transmission time of each task is reduced by more than 5 s. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Distributed estimation in interconnected systems has gained increasing attention due to its relevance in diverse applications such as sensor networks, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing. In real practice, the sensor network may suffer from communication and/or sensor failures. This might be due to cyber-attacks, faults, or environmental conditions. Distributed estimation resilient to such conditions is the topic of this paper. By representing the sensor network as a graph and exploiting its inherent structural properties, we introduce novel techniques that enhance the robustness of distributed estimators. As compared to the literature, the proposed estimator (i) relaxes the network connectivity of most existing single time-scale estimators and (ii) reduces the communication load of the existing double time-scale estimators by avoiding the inner consensus loop. On the other hand, the sensors might be subject to faults or attacks, resulting in biased measurements. Removing these sensor data may result in observability loss. Therefore, we propose resilient design on the definitions of q-node-connectivity and q-link-connectivity, which capture robust strong-connectivity under link or sensor node failure. By proper design of the sensor network, we prove Schur stability of the proposed distributed estimation protocol under failure of up to q sensors or q communication links. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Federation, a model where multiple cloud providers collaborate to offer interconnected services, has become increasingly renowned in cloud computing. In this environment, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) play a critical role by formalising service expectations and fostering transparency between providers and consumers. Although existing SLA ontologies provide a semantic foundation for standardised SLA management, they lack components for detailed risk management and representation within SLA. This paper presents our work on developing OTRA - Ontology for Transparent Agreement - specifically designed for risk management within SLAs in federated cloud environments. By integrating structured risk identification, prevention and mitigation strategies, our ontology extends the Gaia-X Core Ontology. We validate our ontology through a controlled simulation that demonstrates its effectiveness in structuring SLA risk information, offering a foundation for transparent, accountable service agreements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) are becoming integral in sectors such as energy and manufacturing, catalyzing applications from monitoring and analysis to optimization and autonomous management. However, data in different formats, volumes, and qualities require high processing capabilities for integration. Moreover, the functionalities in DTs must work together, bringing interoperability challenges that have necessitated extensive manual programming. To address these, we propose the Internet of Twins, a disaggregated DT deployed in a distributed cloud architecture where interconnections are made using a remote procedure call framework, gRPC. Using this, we develop DT as a platform with knowledge-graph-based orchestration. Here, we implement a recursive execution algorithm to ensure necessary data are processed in the correct sequence autonomously. Then, we implement a wind energy pilot application and evaluate the performance. The results show that our approach lowers data preprocessing and line-of-code overhead up to 20% and 26%, creating a flexible and scalable architecture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid expansion of cloud computing has led to increased energy consumption, raising concerns about its environmental impact. Despite advancements in scheduling algorithms, existing methods face critical challenges, including suboptimal energy efficiency, limited adaptability to dynamic cloud environments, and insufficient context-aware decision-making. Recent techniques, such as Meta Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and Energy-Aware Scheduling, show potential but often struggle with high computational complexity, static resource allocation, or scalability issues. These shortcomings result in inefficient resource utilization, elevated energy usage, and difficulties in meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Energy Efficient Semantic Scheduling Framework (ESSF), a novel approach combining semantic reasoning and energy profiling to optimize task scheduling in dynamic cloud environments. The framework integrates three key components: (1) Dynamic Energy Profiling (DEP) for real-time energy monitoring, (2) Semantic Resource Matching (SRM) utilizing knowledge graphs for context-aware allocation, and (3) Adaptive Workload Balancing (AWB) to dynamically redistribute tasks for improved resource utilization and energy efficiency. Experiments using the Google Cluster Trace Dataset demonstrate that ESSF reduces energy consumption by up to 25% compared to traditional methods while achieving 90% resource utilization and 97% SLA compliance. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to overcome existing limitations, offering a scalable, adaptive, and environmentally sustainable solution for task scheduling in cloud computing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Structural Genomics Consortium is an international open science research organization with a focus on accelerating early-stage drug discovery, namely hit discovery and optimization. We, as many others, believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to be a main accelerator in the field. The question is then how to best benefit from recent advances in AI and how to generate, format and disseminate data to enable future breakthroughs in AI-guided drug discovery. We present here the recommendations of a working group composed of experts from both the public and private sectors. Robust data management requires precise ontologies and standardized vocabulary while a centralized database architecture across laboratories facilitates data integration into high-value datasets. Lab automation and opening electronic lab notebooks to data mining push the boundaries of data sharing and data modeling. Important considerations for building robust machine-learning models include transparent and reproducible data processing, choosing the most relevant data representation, defining the right training and test sets, and estimating prediction uncertainty. Beyond data-sharing, cloud-based computing can be harnessed to build and disseminate machine-learning models. Important vectors of acceleration for hit and chemical probe discovery will be (1) the real-time integration of experimental data generation and modeling workflows within design-make-test-analyze (DMTA) cycles openly, and at scale and (2) the adoption of a mindset where data scientists and experimentalists work as a unified team, and where data science is incorporated into the experimental design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - E-health has become a top priority for healthcare organizations focused on advancing healthcare services. Thus, medical organizations have been widely adopting cloud services, resulting in the effective storage of sensitive data. To prevent privacy and security issues associated with the data, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been a popular choice for encrypting private data. Likewise, the attribute-based access control (ABAC) technique has been widely adopted for controlling data access. Researchers have proposed electronic health record (EHR) systems using ABE techniques like ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), key policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE), and multi authority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE). However, there is a lack of rigorous comparison among the various ABE schemes used in healthcare systems. To better understand the usability of ABE techniques in medical systems, we performed a comprehensive review and evaluation of the three popular ABE techniques by developing EHR systems using knowledge graphs with the same data but different encryption mechanisms. We have used the MIMIC-III dataset with varying record sizes for this study. This paper can help healthcare organizations or researchers using ABE in their systems to comprehend the correct usage scenario and the prospect of ABE deployment in the most recent technological evolution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, we have witnessed more and more data management, preparation, and wrangling services appearing in the cloud. Semantic type detection is important for these services that rely on semantic types to interpret data and provide useful functions accordingly. Meanwhile, deep learning (DL) has been introduced for semantic type detection and transforming the field. However, existing DL-based approaches, albeit successfully achieving high F1 scores, are not practical in the real cloud environment because they suffer from issues like low efficiency and high intrusiveness to user data sources. To address these issues, we present Taste, a novel semantic type detection framework with two phases, each associated with a DL-driven detection task. The intuition behind this framework is that metadata (e.g., column name, statistics) contain rich technical and business information, which can be leveraged to detect semantic types effectively while only incurring lightweight impact on user data sources. Thus, we design the detection task in the first phase purely using native metadata from user data sources as input. In contrast, the second phase is optional and only activated when there is a high uncertainty with the first task’s result. It then needs to retrieve both metadata and column content to derive semantic types more reliably. Furthermore, we adopt multi-task learning and develop a novel DL model, called Asymmetric Double-Tower Detection (ADTD), to support the two tasks simultaneously. This design enables caching and reuse of the latent representations from the first task to reduce inference time. In the implementation, we further introduce a pipelined execution mechanism to boost performance for massive user table processing. Evaluation results show that Taste achieves state-of-the-art performance in execution time and F1 score, and is more robust under different data privacy settings, demonstrating its potential for real application in cloud environment. 1 © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge graphs have proven vital for efficient data management, enhanced search capabilities, and improved decision-making in various information technology domains. However, constructing reliable knowledge graphs in decentralized ecosystems, with distributed autonomous actors, poses significant challenges related to asynchronous transmission, out-of-order knowledge-sharing, device heterogeneity, and trust issues. These challenges are also present in resource orchestration within multi-cloud edge ecosystems where multiple stakeholders must collaborate and share information to enable next-gen smart applications. In this paper, we propose a novel system design that utilizes Distributed Ledger Technology to build knowledge graphs. This approach ensures consistent and trustworthy knowledge sharing among orchestrators in a cloud-edge continuum. Our solution accommodates diverse requirements of both cloud and edge servers, allowing clients to construct complete historic graphs or build filtered sub-graphs. We deploy our solution in a multi-cloud edge environment and construct knowledge graphs representing the system state, including clusters, servers, microservices, and various resources. We validate the feasibility and performance of our solution through a real-world deployment and experiments in a smart shopping use case. Results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves the claimed benefits with minimal or acceptable delays in comparison to traditional event streaming services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional privacy-preserving search schemes have commonly used the TF-IDF model, which relies on keyword frequency statistics but neglects the semantic relationships between and documents. In recent years, a few secure multi-keyword ranked search schemes over encrypted cloud data have considered the data semantics. However, the search efficiency of these schemes can still be improved. This paper presents an efficient privacy-preserving semantic-aware multi-keyword ranked search scheme (EPSMR) over encrypted cloud data. EPSMR utilizes the LDA topic model to discover hidden semantic information in documents and convert documents into vector representations. vector encryption by using the secure inner product is employed to implement the privacy-preserving semantic relevance score computation between search keywords and documents. To achieve efficient multi-keyword searches, the bisecting k-means algorithm and search tree structure are introduced to design a novel ω-way balanced search tree index which benefits finding search results quickly. to further improve the search efficiency, a filtering-threshold lookup table is presented, which can be used to prune unqualified sub-trees in advance. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared to existing schemes in terms of both semantic search precision and search time cost. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a tremendous amount of data present on the web and accessing useful/relevant information from a cluster of random documents is a tedious and time-consuming task. Traditional information retrieval techniques and information management systems are not that intelligent to extract relevant information from pre-defined datasets or documents. This necessitates the researchers to create and enhance a sophisticated information retrieval system. Also, the similarity between information is equipped with uncertainties due to its computing measures. Keeping these issues in mind, a neuro-fuzzy and ontological-based model in a multi-tenant cloud environment is proposed in this research study. The model comprises modules like query expansion, the weighting of terms and queries, and hashing function to ease the retrieval process followed by validation of the dataset using a neuro-fuzzy network to retrieve relevant information from the cloud service provider. The simulation results prove the validation of the proposed model in terms of higher accuracy and better retrieval performance as compared to traditional models (support vector machines and deep neural networks) as well as existing recent works. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of industrial Internet, cloud computing, and big data technology is changing the business and management mode of the industry chain. However, the industry chain is characterized by a wide range of fields, complex environment, and many factors, which creates a challenge for efficient integration and leveraging of industrial big data. Aiming at the integration of physical space and virtual space of the current industry chain, we propose an industry chain digital twin (DT) system framework for the industrial Internet. In addition, an industry chain information model based on a knowledge graph (KG) is proposed to integrate complex and heterogeneous industry chain data and extract industrial knowledge. First, the ontology of the industry chain is established, and an entity alignment method based on scientific and technological achievements is proposed. Second, the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) based multi-head selection model is proposed for joint entity–relation extraction of industry chain information. Third, a relation completion model based on a relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN) and a graph sample and aggregate network (GraphSAGE) is proposed which considers both semantic information and graph structure information of KG. Experimental results show that the performances of the proposed joint entity–relation extraction model and relation completion model are significantly better than those of the baselines. Finally, an industry chain information model is established based on the data of 18 industry chains in the field of basic machinery, which proves the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ontological knowledge graph (OKG) is a well-formed visual representation that depicts knowledge organization in formal elements (e.g., entities and attributes) and their interrelationships. OKG is crucial for innovation management analysis as it provides a clear boundary to understand complex knowledge domain in detail. In the patent analysis field, it facilitates the definition of a well-defined patent portfolio, aiming for accurate and complete patent retrievals and subsequent analyses. In recent decade, the rapid growth of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector has rendered data centers (DCs) indispensable for data processing, storage, and cloud computing, while ensuring security and privacy during DC operations. However, their energy-intensive operations pose challenges to global efforts toward achieving net-zero emissions goals. In response, this research develops a formal OKG refinement process and uses DC net-zero technology OKG as case study for in-depth OKG refinement and application in patent portfolio analysis. The net-zero DC domain covers five sub-technologies. Utilizing the proposed OKG refinement and patent portfolio analysis framework, the 1801 most recent decade’s patents related to relevant “DC net-zero technologies” are retrieved and analyzed. Particularly in this case, DC colocation and server-as-a-service perspectives are the newly discovered sub-domains for OKG refinement. Furthermore, the research also adopts the technology function matrix and technology maturity to assess current and future technology development trends, providing crucial insights supporting strategic innovation management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This manuscript describes the development of a resource module that is part of a learning platform named ‘NIGMS Sandbox for Cloud-based Learning’ (https://github.com/NIGMS/NIGMS-Sandbox). The module delivers learning materials on Cloud-based Consensus Pathway Analysis in an interactive format that uses appropriate cloud resources for data access and analyses. Pathway analysis is important because it allows us to gain insights into biological mechanisms underlying conditions. But the availability of many pathway analysis methods, the requirement of coding skills, and the focus of current tools on only a few species all make it very difficult for biomedical researchers to self-learn and perform pathway analysis efficiently. Furthermore, there is a lack of tools that allow researchers to compare analysis results obtained from different experiments and different analysis methods to find consensus results. To address these challenges, we have designed a cloud-based, self-learning module that provides consensus results among established, state-of-the-art pathway analysis techniques to provide students and researchers with necessary training and example materials. The training module consists of five Jupyter Notebooks that provide complete tutorials for the following tasks: (i) process expression data, (ii) perform differential analysis, visualize and compare the results obtained from four differential analysis methods (limma, t-test, edgeR, DESeq2), (iii) process three pathway databases (GO, KEGG and Reactome), (iv) perform pathway analysis using eight methods (ORA, CAMERA, KS test, Wilcoxon test, FGSEA, GSA, SAFE and PADOG) and (v) combine results of multiple analyses. We also provide examples, source code, explanations and instructional videos for trainees to complete each Jupyter Notebook. The module supports the analysis for many model (e.g. human, mouse, fruit fly, zebra fish) and non-model species. The module is publicly available at https://github.com/NIGMS/ Consensus-Pathway-Analysis-in-the-Cloud. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid development of cloud computing paradigm and mobile devices, the number of cloud services and user interest data are growing explosively. It becomes harder for users to find suitable cloud services within satisfying response time. Thus a suitable cloud service automatic recommendation system is needed to solve the above problem. In this work, we propose KG2Rec, a novel recommendation method based on Knowledge Graph to provide users with appropriate recommendations to meet their real-time needs. The property-specific knowledge graph model is designed to model user–item and item–item bipartite relations. Based on the property-specific knowledge graph model, property-specific user–item relation features can be mined from it. Then the user–item relation features will be integrated into an improved collaborative filtering algorithm based on the local sensitive hash technique for Top-N item recommendation. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method in terms of Top-N recommendation on the MovieLens dataset, and prove it outperforms numbers of state-of-the-art recommendation systems. In addition, we prove it has well performance in term of long tail recommendation and big data processing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) is a collection of data commons, analysis platforms, and tools that make existing cancer data more findable and accessible by the cancer research community. In practice, the two biggest hurdles to finding and using data for discovery are the wide variety of models and ontologies used to describe data, and the dispersed storage of that data. Here, we outline core CRDC services to aggregate descriptive information from multiple studies for findability via a single interface and to provide a single access method that spans multiple data commons. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the continuous growth of cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and medical data, medical organizations are particularly concerned about storing patient data to provide fast services while adhering to privacy and security concerns. Existing EHR systems often face challenges in handling heterogeneous data and maintaining good performance with data growth. These systems mostly use relational databases or partially store data in a knowledge graph, making it challenging to handle big data and allowing flexible schema expansion. Hence, there is a need to address these problems. This paper provides a solution by proposing a novel graph-based EHR system integrating Attribute-Based Encryption and Semantic Web Technologies to ensure fine-grained EHR field-level security of patient records. Our approach leverages semantic context to query through a knowledge graph that stores encrypted medical data in the nodes, making it possible to handle heterogeneous data while ensuring optimal performance and preserving patient privacy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The rapid growth of omics technologies has led to the use of bioinformatics as a powerful tool for unravelling scientific puzzles. However, the obstacles of bioinformatics are compounded by the complexity of data processing and the distinct nature of omics data types, particularly in terms of visualization and statistics. Objectives: We developed a comprehensive and free platform, CFViSA, to facilitate effortless visualization and statistical analysis of omics data by the scientific community. Methods: CFViSA was constructed using the Scala programming language and utilizes the AKKA toolkit for the web server and MySQL for the database server. The visualization and statistical analysis were performed with the R program. Results: CFViSA integrates two omics data analysis pipelines (microbiome and transcriptome analysis) and an extensive array of 79 analysis tools spanning simple sequence processing, visualization, and statistics available for various omics data, including microbiome and transcriptome data. CFViSA starts from an analysis interface, paralleling a demonstration full course to help users understand operating principles and scientifically set the analysis parameters. Once analysis is conducted, users can enter the task history interface for figure adjustments, and then a complete series of results, including statistics, feature tables and figures. All the graphic layouts were printed with necessary statistics and a traceback function recording the options for analysis and visualization; these statistics were excluded from the five competing methods. Conclusion: CFViSA is a user-friendly bioinformatics cloud platform with detailed guidelines for integrating functions in multi-omics analysis with real-time visualization adjustment and complete series of results provision. CFViSA is available at http://www.cloud.biomicroclass.com/en/CFViSA/. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As an indispensable architecture for future 6G communication networks, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) integrates satellite networks, air networks and ground networks, greatly expanding the coverage of network space. Compared with the traditional mobile edge computing (MEC), the edge intelligence (EI) formed by combining artificial intelligence (AI) and MEC can intelligently process the edge data by embedding the AI algorithms into the edge devices with limited computing power. Therefore, this article considers applying EI to SAGIN to form the EI-driven SAGIN architecture, which can significantly enhance the communication, computing, sensing and storage capabilities of SAGIN architecture to solve the problem of efficient resource management for resource-constrained users. In this article, we first introduce the system network architecture and logical functional architecture, and give a detailed description of the components in the network architecture, and then discuss some key technologies in the system, including efficient resource utilization for microservice based on software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based on knowledge graph for efficient storage and intelligent computing, and efficient and realtime sensing for massive information. Finally, we propose a DRL-based resource allocation and computation offloading algorithm for microservices (DRCAM) and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that, compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm could greatly reduce the system cost under different weights. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The orchestration of cloud computing infrastructures is challenging, considering the number, heterogeneity and dynamicity of the involved resources, along with the highly distributed nature of the applications that use them for computation and storage. Evidently, the volume of relevant monitoring data can be significant, and the ability to collect, analyze, and act on this data in real time is critical for the infrastructure’s efficient use. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that adeptly manages the diverse, dynamic, and voluminous nature of cloud resources and the applications that they support. We use knowledge graphs to represent computing and storage resources and illustrate the relationships between them and the applications that utilize them. We then train GraphSAGE to acquire vector-based representations of the infrastructures’ properties, while preserving the structural properties of the graph. These are efficiently provided as input to two unsupervised machine learning algorithms, namely CBLOF and Isolation Forest, for the detection of storage and computing overusage events, where CBLOF demonstrates better performance across all our evaluation metrics. Following the detection of such events, we have also developed appropriate re-optimization mechanisms that ensure the performance of the served applications. Evaluated in a simulated environment, our methods demonstrate a significant advancement in anomaly detection and infrastructure optimization. The results underscore the potential of this closed-loop operation in dynamically adapting to the evolving demands of cloud infrastructures. By integrating data representation and machine learning methods with proactive management strategies, this research contributes substantially to the field of cloud computing, offering a scalable, intelligent solution for modern cloud infrastructures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the drive to create a decentralized digital economy, Web 3.0 has become a cornerstone of digital transformation, developed on the basis of computing power networks, distributed data storage, and blockchain. With the rapid realization of quantum devices, Web 3.0 is being developed in parallel with the deployment of quantum cloud computing and quantum Internet. In this regard, quantum computing first disrupts the original cryptographic systems that protect data security while reshaping modern cryptography with the advantages of quantum computing and communication. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a quantum blockchain-driven Web 3.0 framework that provides information-theoretic security for decentralized data transferring and payment transactions. First, we present the framework of quantum blockchain-driven Web 3.0 with futureproof security during the transmission of data and transaction information. Next, we discuss the potential applications and challenges of implementing quantum blockchain in Web 3.0. Finally, we describe a use case for quantum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and propose a quantum deep learning-based optimal auction for NFT trading to maximize the achievable revenue for sufficient liquidity in Web 3.0. In this way, the proposed framework can achieve proven security and sustainability for the next-generation decentralized digital society. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Computing has revolutionized the way applications are developed, deployed, and maintained. Over the past decade, we have observed dynamically growing interest in Cloud Computing. The benefits of the cloud approach caused the increasing popularity of Cloud-native applications. Cloud-native is an approach to developing and deploying applications according to the concepts of DevOps, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), containers and microservices. The knowledge about Cloud Computing has become extensive and complex. Fortunately, before Cloud-native applications development, there was a great deal of effort to develop tools for effective knowledge representation. Ontologies are a convenient way to show the relations between domain-specific concepts. In this paper, we propose an ontology named CNOnt that describes the state-of-the-art of Cloud-native applications. CNOnt covers aspects from the clusterization perspective. First, this paper presents the engineering perspective of building the CNOnt ontology. Second, we demonstrate a use case of our ontology that proves the correctness of CNOnt development. This ontology is exhausted in CNOnt Broker. It is a system that applies the information in the OWL file into the Kubernetes cluster and in reverse. The knowledge representation makes Cloud-native applications understandable to third-party systems and increases interoperability between different microservices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A continuing global desire to be using clinical systems within a digital health ecosystem, able to facilitate data flows and information exchange as required to support person-centred, predictive, preventative, participatory and precision (5p) health and medical care can best be supported through the use of the standard categorial structure able to represent not only the clinical nursing practice domain but also other clinical disciplines by the generic labelling of some high-level categories. It is hypothesised that adoption of this generic clinical categorial structure within any electronic health/medical record within a well connected digital health ecosystem, supported by a cloud based openEHR platform, will enable the 5p support to be realized. This presentation provides the results of the latest update of this technical standard based on the 20+ year nursing practice categorial structure development process adopted to achieve this aim and a summary about linking this categorial structure to standard terminologies and to standard EHR/EMR system architectures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this survey paper, the critical security and privacy issues in cloud computing are taken into consideration, and made use of improving data security measures and confidences concerning sensitive information against potential threats from both outside attackers and cloud providers toward bracing the serious barriers to the widespread adoption of cloud technology. It applies ontological approaches toward an overall security assurance model with the help of ontology-based approaches to facilitate improved data protection along with compliance verification. The key advantages of the new security protocols and methodologies developed under this proposed framework allow customers to maintain control over their information and to validly verify safety measures. This framework will address one of the fastest growing needs for improving data security in the cloud, encouraging further trust and facilitating wider acceptance of cloud services. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of the current ontologybased security solutions, summarizing their strengths and weaknesses and then advocating for a sophisticated security framework that would guarantee data protection in cloud environments. In fact, previous research has shown that different security risks exist in the cloud computing environment that can originate from various entities and activities. Therefore, different solutions have been created to tackle each of these unique concerns. The virtual machines of the clients should there-fore be effectively monitored and guarded by cloud providers through the use of a standardized cloud security platform. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cybersecurity compliance has become increasingly complex due to evolving threats, overlapping standards, and rapidly changing requirements driven by emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. Organizations face significant challenges in efficiently mapping compliance requirements to specific security controls. This paper addresses this issue within the cloud industry by presenting a systematic approach to deploying a knowledge graph or ontology that maps cloud security controls at the granular implementation level to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Unlike previous efforts focused on high-level mappings, this approach enhances compliance efficiency and supports integration with common software languages such as HTTP and Java. The proposed methodology can also be adapted to other compliance standards. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The evolution of cloud computing, driven by ad-vances in mobile, edge technologies, and AI, has led to the development of the Cognitive Cloud Continuum (COCLCON). However, this paradigm introduces new challenges in managing and optimizing computing resources across a heterogeneous environment. This paper explores best practices for declaring resources within COCLCON, with a focus on efficient resource allocation and transparently declaring available resources by de-vices. In this study, we undertook a non-holistic literature review to identify current technologies used to specify requirements and to determine current gaps in best practices. The main outcome of our work is a proposed schema for Resource Provisioning Declaration, which will allow for increased knowledge related to the available devices and resources within the COCLCON. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fault injection ensures resilience of cloud-edge computing systems. Recognizing the importance of fault injection underscores a critical challenge: the need to enhance system observability for conducting effective and comprehensive fault injection experiments. This is particularly crucial due to the complex, distributed architectures of cloud-edge environments, where a single failure can trigger cascading failures, creating a dynamic and expanding fault blast radius. To address these challenges, this work advocates for the adoption of knowledge graph technologies to significantly improve fault knowledge representation, system observability, and minimize resource expenditure on monitoring systems. We introduce the Fault Observation Knowledge Graph (FOKG), comprising three detailed sub-knowledge graphs that describe the nuances of application deployment, delineate known fault chains, and outline the monitoring mechanisms in place. By extracting dynamic fault blast radius information and refining monitoring strategies from FOKG after fault injection, we ensure a more targeted observation and efficient fault injection experiment. Our methodology, validated on a custom-developed OpenStack platform, surpasses traditional fault injection techniques by achieving a remarkable 42.76% reduction in the average time required to observe the complete fault blast radius. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, Information Systems (IS) in healthcare systems are being successively updated, either incorporating advanced Optimization tools combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM), or using innovative computing features for storage, processing, security, privacy, and friendly interface. Large efforts are required to design, validate and implement such developments, diverse communities in multiple scientific domains are involved, and new approaches are key to cope with the transdisciplinary gaps. In this paper we outline and discuss the relevant technologies and methodologies for IS within the context of health emergencies. Advanced and innovative approaches are being applied within the Health Informatics area, and we address a set of key technologies (e.g., Cloud Computing, AI-based platforms, Neural Networks) and methodologies (e.g., Knowledge Graphs, advanced Optimization, Multi-Criteria Decision Making) that are being relevant within the Health Emergency Responses (HER) framework, and also for the health informatics communities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid development of knowledge graphs and cloud computing, most people choose to store knowledge graphs on commercial cloud platforms. However, since cloud platforms are not completely trustworthy, this exposes graph data to security risks. Therefore, protecting knowledge graph data stored on third-party cloud platforms is essential. Based on these considerations, we propose a Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption-based Knowledge Graph scheme (DSSE-KG). DSSE-KG aims to address the privacy and security risks associated with storing knowledge graph data on cloud servers. Compared to existing schemes, DSSE-KG not only ensures the data security of knowledge graphs but also provides multi-hop relationship retrieval and dynamic update capabilities. Performance tests on multiple publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that the DSSE-KG scheme achieves a good balance between security, functionality, and efficiency for knowledge graphs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article aims to explore a data-driven financial risk prediction model based on cloud computing technology. This model achieves accurate identification and prediction of corporate financial risks by integrating advanced algorithms and knowledge graph technology. This article proposes a new risk prediction algorithm model that combines multiple methods such as machine learning, deep learning, and statistical analysis to learn patterns from historical data and predict future financial risks. In addition, the application of knowledge graph enables the model to better understand the internal connections of financial data and improve the accuracy of predictions. Finally, through system simulation experiments, this paper verifies the effectiveness and stability of the proposed model in practical applications. Experimental results show that this model can significantly improve the accuracy of financial risk prediction and provide powerful decision support for enterprises. This research not only enriches the theoretical system in the field of financial risk management, but also provides new ideas and technical means for the practice of financial risk management and control of enterprises. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The ever-evolving automotive domain undergoes a fundamental shift fromhardware-based to software-centric high-tech products with a high level of service integration. Connected and automated vehicles enable data-driven innovations throughmodern, upgradeable, flexible, and extensible software architectures, artificial intelligence, and specialized hardware with built-in connectivity. Such vehicles operate in a safety-critical and time-sensitive environment and are subjected to various nonfunctional requirements including quality, reliability, security, and safety. However, testing these requirements poses several challenges and requires large heterogeneous data sets fromreal-world scenarios. While on-road testing is a huge effort in both time and cost, traffic simulations in combination with further simulations allow to prove the technical feasibility and reduce the risks for sophisticated and expensive software developments. Currently, a lot of research is conducted in the domain of automated driving systems, but there is a lack of simulation-based testing approaches that focus on the connectivity dimension and, in particular,mobility services running in the cloud and servingmultiple vehicles at scale. Therefore, we propose amodeling approach to describe scenarios that involve cloud-basedmobility services. More precisely, an ontology along with a corresponding domain-specific language is introduced that allows one to formally represent the domain concepts, their characteristics, and interrelationships throughmodel-based scenario descriptions. Furthermore, we discuss the notation for the language and propose a web-based user interface that abstracts domain complexity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The usefulness of semantic technologies in the context of security has been demonstrated many times, e.g., for processing certification evidence, log files, and creating security policies. Integrating semantic technologies, like ontologies, in an automated workflow, however, is cumbersome since they introduce disruptions between the different technologies and data formats that are used. This is especially true for modern cloud-native applications, which rely heavily on technologies such as protobuf. In this paper we argue that these technology disruptions represent a major hindrance to the adoption of semantic technologies into the cloud and more effort and research is required to overcome them. We created one such approach called owl2proto, which provides an automatic translation of OWL ontologies into the protobuf data format. We showcase the seamless integration of an ontology and transmission of semantic data in an already existing cloud micro-service. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid expansion of cloud computing has necessitated the development of multi-cloud strategies, which leverage the strengths of multiple cloud service providers to mitigate risks such as vendor lock-in and enhance performance and reliability. Nevertheless, semantic interoperability remains a critical challenge in multi-cloud platforms, where diverse cloud services need to communicate and function seamlessly. Current solutions lack a unified semantic-based representation within reference architectures in multi-cloud platforms and mainly focus on the independent interoperability of a service model, i.e., SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. This study addresses the critical issue of semantic interoperability in multi-cloud platforms, where the heterogeneity of proprietary cloud solutions impedes seamless integration and communication. Thus, we proposed a reference architecture utilizing an ontology-based approach to facilitate semantic interoperability across diverse cloud platforms. The reference architecture is based on five semantic interoperability requirements identified in our previous study. This paper presents the design and development of a reference architecture that includes high-level and low-level components supported by a taxonomy of semantic interoperability in multi-cloud platforms. Expected outcomes of this study include a standardized framework using an ontology-based approach for semantic mapping and integration of cloud services, which will significantly enhance interoperability and efficiency in multi-cloud platforms. The significance of this research lies in its potential to advance the state of knowledge and practice in multi-cloud computing, enabling more robust and flexible cloud service ecosystems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The digitalization of scientific research has significantly advanced with the use of information and communication technologies, particularly in the field of physical and rehabilitation medicine and its telerehabilitation branch. A hybrid cloud platform for telerehabilitation medicine is implemented as a component-based collection of services, including a medical information system for rehabilitation, a dialog information and reference system (MedRehabBot), a predictive and analytical system for assessing rehabilitation process effectiveness, and services for optimizing rehabilitation process models. These services operate within an ontology-driven, service-oriented architecture. One of the key advantages of this type of architecture is its support for experimental design systems, where the design process of the target architecture is accompanied by scientific research. This paper examines the overall functional architecture of the platform (and its technical requirements) in the form of three interacting subsystems: medical-rehabilitation, information-analytical, and telerehabilitation. The architectural and technological organization of the platform is developed using a model that implements an advanced concept of an automated scientific research workstation. The main practical achievement is the implementation and deployment of this architectural and technological organization of the platform, which opens new opportunities for telerehabilitation in medicine. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the cloud computing environment, the application of data encryption technology is of great significance to the improvement of network information security. This paper discusses the key challenges and solutions of data encryption technology in cloud computing, focusing on the application of symmetric and asymmetric encryption technologies and their effects. Comparative experimental analyses show that symmetric encryption has a processing speed of about 10,000 encryption operations per second and low resource consumption, while asymmetric encryption has a processing speed of about 500 encryption operations per second but excels in security and key management. The experimental results show that the combined use of symmetric and asymmetric encryption can achieve more efficient and secure data protection in cloud computing environments. Ultimately, this paper suggests future research directions to further enhance data security in cloud computing environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A cloud computing resource scheduling algorithm based on sampled collaborative knowledge graph network is designed to address the issues of lag in the process of cloud computing resource scheduling, high overall load rate, and large transient amplitude and phase errors. Based on graph convolutional neural networks, analyze the target load of cloud platforms, construct multi hop data transmission paths one by one, and perform deep level information load balancing; Establish a multiplexing information transmission model, correct the initial weights of graph convolutional neural networks, combine reverse transmission calculation methods, integrate and balance cloud computing resources, and confirm the optimal resource scheduling plan; Integrating class convolution and human-machine interaction attention mechanism, the value of the previous time series neural unit is transferred to the current neural unit, and the classification output sequence of knowledge graph relational data feature fragments is analyzed. The knowledge graph data fragments are processed based on class convolution and human-machine interaction attention mechanism, and different sizes of linear aggregators are used to capture deep level information, completing the design of cloud computing resource scheduling algorithm. The experimental results show that although the load rate is on the rise, the highest is only 89%, and the scheduling rate is relatively high, ranging from 38.9 to 43.1bps; The energy consumption is relatively low, not exceeding 40.106mW. In terms of transient amplitude and phase, the proposed method can control the error within 2.0. Ensure the efficiency and practical application effectiveness of cloud computing resource scheduling algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Allergy disorders caused by biological particles, such as the proteins in some airborne pollen grains, are currently considered one of the most common chronic diseases, and European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology forecasts indicate that within 15 years 50% of Europeans will have some kind of allergy as a consequence of urbanization, industrialization, pollution, and climate change. Objective: The aim of this study was to monitor and analyze the dissemination of information about pollen symptoms from December 2006 to January 2022. By conducting a comprehensive evaluation of public comments and trends on Twitter, the research sought to provide valuable insights into the impact of pollen on sensitive individuals, ultimately enhancing our understanding of how pollen-related information spreads and its implications for public health awareness. Methods: Using a blend of large language models, dimensionality reduction, unsupervised clustering, and term frequency-inverse document frequency, alongside visual representations such as word clouds and semantic interaction graphs, our study analyzed Twitter data to uncover insights on respiratory allergies. This concise methodology enabled the extraction of significant themes and patterns, offering a deep dive into public knowledge and discussions surrounding respiratory allergies on Twitter. Results: The months between March and August had the highest volume of messages. The percentage of patient tweets appeared to increase notably during the later years, and there was also a potential increase in the prevalence of symptoms, mainly in the morning hours, indicating a potential rise in pollen allergies and related discussions on social media. While pollen allergy is a global issue, specific sociocultural, political, and economic contexts mean that patients experience symptomatology at a localized level, needing appropriate localized responses. Conclusions: The interpretation of tweet information represents a valuable tool to take preventive measures to mitigate the impact of pollen allergy on sensitive patients to achieve equity in living conditions and enhance access to health information and services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the diversified application scenarios at Ant Group, we built the Ant Knowledge Graph Platform (AKGP). It has constructed numerous domain-specific knowledge graphs related to merchants, companies, accounts, products, and more. AKGP manages trillions of structured knowledge graphs, serving search, recommendation, risk control and other businesses. However, as the demand increasing for various workloads such as graph pattern matching, graph representation learning, and cross-domain knowledge reuse, the existing warehouse systems based on relational DBMS or graph databases are unable to meet the requirements. To address these issues, we propose KGFabric, an industrial-scale knowledge graph management system built on the distributed file system (DFS). KGFabric offers a nearline knowledge storage engine that utilizes a Semantic-enhanced Programmable Graph (SPG) model, which is compatible with the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model. The data is persistently stored in DFS, such as HDFS, which leverages the POSIX file system API, making it suitable for deployment in multi-cloud environment at low cost. KGFabric provides a native graph-based and hybrid storage format that can serve as a shared backend for parallel graph computing systems, significantly accelerating the analysis of multi-workload. Additionally, KGFabric includes a graph fabric framework that minimizes data duplication and guarantees data security. KGFabric is able to manage Peta-scale data and has supported graph fabric and analysis with over 100 billion relations at Ant Group. We conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate the performance of KGFabric. Compared with popular relational DBMS and graph databases, the storage space for semantic relations is reduced by over 90%. The performance of graph fabric improves by 21X in real-world workloads. In multi-hop semantic graph analysis, KGFabric enhances performance by 100X. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Semantic interoperability (SI) is defined as the capability of interpreting the nature of the information exchanged inside cloud computing (CC). For SI, ontology is selected as a solution. A hierarchical structure is offered by an ontology that comprises semantic relations between the application and the cloud server (CS). Even though different methods are introduced, ontology centered on semantic relation between the application and CS is not yet attained for achieving accurate interoperability. An ontology-centered SI in CC utilizing a modified Shell Game optimization-centered recurrent neural network (MSGO-RNN) is presented in this work. Here, accessing the data from the data warehouse is initiated that experiences different standardization functions for improving the data’s quality, namely, data extraction, data cleaning, data transformation, data loading, and refreshing. Then, the data are passed via the semantic layer (SL), which offers a constant way of interpreting data. Then, for enhancing the accuracy rate of interoperability along with offering a low computational time, the relevant feature is chosen utilizing genetic crossover mutation-centered improved fertile field (GCM-IFF) optimization. Ontology is created utilizing the Protégé tool centered on the data, and respective manipulation is executed utilizing HermiT ontology web language (OWL) reasoner. Lastly, to attain cloud interoperability, the features are trained and tested by employing the MSGO-RNN. The experimental outcome exhibits that when compared with the top-notch methods, an accuracy of 96.32% is acquired by the framework for choosing the CS, and less time of 22567 ms is acquired by the framework for training. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper addresses the digitization of power standards in the power industry through the development of knowledge graphs and the application of intelligent technologies. We explore the transformation of standard management, leveraging technologies like cloud computing, big data, and AI, and discuss the strategies of international standardization bodies like ISO and IEC towards machine-readable standards. The core of our research is the construction and application of a power standard knowledge graph, aimed at enhancing the management of standardized knowledge. This involves stages from data collection, incorporating OCR technology, to data management with an emphasis on data quality and security. A significant contribution of this work is the development of the PLM-based Knowledge Graph Completion Model, particularly focusing on the KG-SBERT model, which integrates semantic and structured features from pre-trained language models and knowledge graphs. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of KG-SBERT over traditional KGE models in knowledge graph completion tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt information in improving model performance. surpassing traditional knowledge graph embedding techniques in link prediction accuracy, attaining an MRR of 47.67, and Hits@5 and Hits@10 scores of 25.15, 81.54, and 93.91, respectively. This study underlines the critical role of digital transformation in the power industry, demonstrating how advanced technologies can significantly enhance the management, security, and accessibility of power standards, with broad implications for the industry's future development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The creation and execution of applications in several disciplines have been greatly aided by the integration of cloud computing and semantic web technologies. Although they are independent entities, they may also be combined in many ways to provide answers - a subject that has been thoroughly researched lately. The number of 'new cloud providers, applications, facilities, management systems, and data' has significantly increased in recent years. The complexity that has resulted from this expansion emphasises the need for new technology in order to efficiently manage and support these varied and many services and resources. As a result, difficulties with 'cloud services and resources' transferability, compatibility, security, choice, negotiation, identity, and specification might arise. Semantic Technologies are a vital tool for reassessing these issues because of their enormous 'cloud computing' capacity. This study uses a variety of sources to examine and evaluate the impact of 'Semantic-Web Technology' in the cloud. Moreover, a cloud-based engagement strategy shows how we may leverage the features and advantages of cloud computing to build the semantic web and provide automatic semantic annotations to online applications on a large scale. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing technologies, including cloud-native and containerization, have gained prominence in recent years, attributed to their exceptional scalability, enhanced resource utilization, and expedited deployment capabilities. However, their inherent complexity and the intricate interplay of internal components heighten the risk of sporadic and unforeseen anomalies. To address these challenges, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is employed to accurately identify problematic services (pods) and mine the precise faults behind observed anomalies. Tailored to the limitations of conventional RCA algorithms, we propose a novel approach that jointly models operation entities and their relationships as learnable embeddings. Additionally, this method integrates fault propagation information to further improve RCA accuracy. Our evaluation involves developing a prototype within the Kubernetes cloud-native system. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Connectivity, whether between objects or with the Internet, has given rise to many new business ideas and associated terminologies. Especially in the automotive industry, new terms have emerged in the field of connected vehicles, which are defined multiple times in academia and industry. This is due to the lack of an ontology that establishes the connection between terminologies and a taxonomy that categorizes them clearly. Therefore, this paper closes this gap by providing an overview of paradigms, concepts, and technologies for vehicle communication, as well as potential execution platforms and concepts.Additionally, we propose use cases that deal with the connected vehicle in the commercial city bus sector. The first use case deals with the connectivity of the vehicle and the associated possibility of executing computationally intensive machine learning models in the cloud. The aim of this use case is to reduce the energy impact of air conditioning in the city bus. The second use case focuses on cooperative perception and cloud/edge connectivity to increase the efficiency of city buses in their daily operation in road traffic by implementing dynamic route optimization that can react promptly to events such as accidents. The paper closes with remarks on future research challenges in the fields of function offloading, the identification of the most suitable execution concept for vehicle functions and the selection of the most fitting variant of a function in the cloud. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the growth of cloud computing, a large number of innovative mashup applications and Web APIs have emerged on the Internet. The expansion of technology and information presents a significant challenge to the discovery of Web APIs from multiple service ecosystems. Various Web API recommendation methods have been proposed for Mashup creation, but most either treat different feature factor interactions equally or solely rely on requirements for API recommendation. These approaches face several challenges such as API compatibility dependencies, ambiguous definition and boundary dilemmas of APIs, and sparse API invocation records. In this work, we propose a Semantic-Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Network(SEHGN) for Mashup creation. To address the above deficiencies, we design a multi-semantic aggregator to capture semantic associations between features to encode multiple node-edge relationships. Then, we introduce a semantic embedding component to generate text embedding vectors for mashups and APIs to learn global and local semantic information about text documents at different levels of abstraction. Finally, we fuse the output vectors to obtain a list of candidate Web APIs. Experiences are performed on real datasets, and statistical results show that SEHGN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of overall and long-tail Web API recommendations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the advancement of mobile cloud computing technology, the demand for collaborative operation and maintenance technology is constantly increasing. Therefore, this article proposes a model that combines multi feature collaborative knowledge graph and blockchain technology to achieve secure and trustworthy collaborative operation and maintenance computing in cross domain environments. The model focuses on addressing data privacy and security issues, and improving the accuracy of collaborative operations. By introducing a multi feature collaborative knowledge graph, secure fusion of multi-source feature data can be achieved. Meanwhile, design a blockchain based trust verification mechanism to ensure the traceability of anonymous data sources, prevent data tampering, and ensure data authenticity. In addition, an adaptive recommendation algorithm based on MKGCN is proposed, which utilizes multi feature collaborative knowledge graph data to achieve secure and accurate collaborative computing. The experimental results show that this method improves the accuracy of recommendation calculation while ensuring privacy and security, promoting the development and practical application of cross domain operation and maintenance computing technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - E-governance is capable of driving the transition of government from an administrative power allocation of public resources to a citizen-service-oriented governance model. However, during this transformation, various governmental bodies often face the challenge of "data silos" caused by factors such as cross-regional, cross-business, and cross-departmental operations. Without altering the existing information platforms, transparent access technology serves as a key solution for data access within e-governance systems. It enables convenient access to information resources stored in different mediums and formats, facilitating the sharing and consolidation of information and data within and between governmental departments, thereby addressing the issue of "data silos" and enhancing the comprehensive service capabilities of e-governance. This paper firstly provides an overview of the concept, levels, characteristics, and application scenarios of transparent access to government big data. Secondly, it conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of transparent access technologies in the context of cloud computing and big data. Lastly, based on the requirements of various transparent access technologies and the application of transparent access to government big data, this paper proposes a visionary framework for transparent access to government big data based on cross-domain semantics and channel coupling. This framework includes modules for cross-domain semantic interoperability, coupling of heterogeneous information channels based on knowledge graph, and tracing of multi-source heterogeneous data, aiming to provide innovative solutions for achieving transparent access to government big data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, security attacks occurring in edge computing environments have emerged as an important research topic in the field of cybersecurity. Edge computing is a distributed computing technology that expands the existing cloud computing architecture to introduce a new layer, the edge layer, between the cloud layer and the user terminal layer. Edge computing has the advantage of greatly improving the data processing speed and efficiency but, at the same time, is complex, and various new attacks occur frequently. Therefore, for improving the security of edge computing, effective and intelligent security strategies and policies must be established in consideration of a wide range of vulnerabilities. Intelligent security systems, which have recently been studied, provide a way to detect and respond to security threats by integrating the latest technologies, such as machine learning and big data analysis. Intelligent security technology can quickly recognize attack patterns or abnormal behaviors within a large amount of data and continuously respond to new threats through learning. In particular, knowledge-based technologies using ontology or knowledge graph technology play an important role in more deeply understanding the meaning and relationships between of security data and more effectively detecting and responding to complex threats. This study proposed a method for recommending strategies to respond to edge computing security incidents based on the automatic generation and embedding of security knowledge graphs. An EdgeSecurity–BERT model, utilizing the latest security vulnerability data from edge computing, was designed to extract entities and their relational information. Also, a security vulnerability assessment method was proposed to recommend strategies to respond to edge computing security incidents through knowledge graph embedding. In the experiment, the classification accuracy of security news data for common vulnerability and exposure data was approximately 86% on average. In addition, the EdgeSecurityKG applying the security vulnerability similarity improved the Hits@10 performance to identify the correct link, but the MR performance was degraded owing to the increased complexity. In complex areas, such as security, careful evaluation of the model’s performance and data selection are important. The EdgeSecurityKG applying the security vulnerability similarity provides an important advantage in understanding complex security vulnerability relationships. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on cloud-edge computing, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is rapidly developing as a key part of greatly facilitating our lives in the era of Web 3.0. Plenty of delay-sensitive tasks are executed in adjacent edge servers (ESs) in IoV, incurring the increasing significance of the distribution of ESs. As a decentralized network, Web 3.0 allows for data and applications to be distributed across multiple nodes, making it more transparent and user-controlled and placing higher demands on security. Specifically, some attackers outside IoV transmit insecure tasks, which may damage the ESs or waste computing resources after being executed in ESs. To achieve the security of Web 3.0, zero-trust security, an enhanced security model, is used, which assumes that all the service requests are not trusted to access the system networks by default unless passing the anomaly detection. Therefore, in this article, a secure ESP method with the non-cooperative game for IoV in cloud-edge computing, named ESPS, is proposed. By incorporating an anomaly detection mechanism of tasks, ESPS enhances the security of ESP. Eventually, the experiments on the distribution of Telecom base stations in Shanghai, China show the effectiveness of ESPS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter discusses the challenges and requirements of modern Research Data Management (RDM), particularly for biomedical applications in the context of high-performance computing (HPC). The FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are of special importance. Data formats, publication platforms, annotation schemata, automated data management and staging, the data infrastructure in HPC centers, file transfer and staging methods in HPC, and the EUDAT components are discussed. Tools and approaches for automated data movement and replication in cross-center workflows are explained, as well as the development of ontologies for structuring and quality-checking of metadata in computational biomedicine. The CompBioMed project is used as a real-world example of implementing these principles and tools in practice. The LEXIS project has built a workflow-execution and data management platform that follows the paradigm of HPC-Cloud convergence for demanding Big Data applications. It is used for orchestrating workflows with YORC, utilizing the data documentation initiative (DDI) and distributed computing resources (DCI). The platform is accessed by a user-friendly LEXIS portal for workflow and data management, making HPC and Cloud Computing significantly more accessible. Checkpointing, duplicate runs, and spare images of the data are used to create resilient workflows. The CompBioMed project is completing the implementation of such a workflow, using data replication and brokering, which will enable urgent computing on exascale platforms.

AB  - Now a day’s ontologies are used to see the information in a vital role in cloud system. Ontologies use semantic assessment to portray data inside an environment with interconnection relationships between heterogeneous sets. In cloud computing, asset management includes checking, apportioning, and provisioning. Servers, memory, limit, arrange, central processor, application servers, and modernized systems, in addition, known as virtual machines, are representations of cloud resources. These machines are the handling units of the cloud. a framework that uses ontologies to present the result of extracting types of data from unstructured or semi-structured characteristic dialect content using a component guided by ontologies. An asset assignment is the process of delegating and managing resources to support an organization’s primary planning goals. Resource task is the strategy for perceiving and giving out resources for a specific period to various activities. These exercises, such as administration, back, operation, and so on, can be extended or non-project work. Quality, Kindness, Protest, and Modality are the four categories. Two capabilities shape the foundation of the fourfold design. The essential refinement is between non-significant substances like modes and characteristics and impressive substances like items and sorts. Ineffective asset management has a coordinated negative impact on execution and fetched as well as a sporadic effect on framework functionality. It can also become too expensive or ineffective due to ineffective execution. Asset administration may be a crucial task for any cloud framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud service owners need to continuously monitor their services to ensure high availability and reliability. Gaps in monitoring can lead to delay in incident detection and significant negative customer impact. Current process of monitor creation is ad-hoc and reactive in nature. Developers create monitors using their tribal knowledge and, primarily, a trial and error based process. As a result, monitors often have incomplete coverage which leads to production issues, or, redundancy which results in noise and wasted effort. In this work, we address this issue by proposing an intelli-gent monitoring framework that recommends monitors for cloud services based on their service properties. We start by mining the attributes of 30,000+ monitors from 791 production services at Microsoft and derive a structured ontology for monitors. We focus on two crucial dimensions: what to monitor (resources) and which metrics to monitor. We conduct an extensive empirical study and derive key insights on the major classes of monitors employed by cloud services at Microsoft, their associated dimensions, and the interrelationship between service properties and this ontology. Using these insights, we propose a deep learning based framework that recommends monitors based on the service properties. Finally, we conduct a user study with engineers from Microsoft which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed framework. The proposed framework along with the ontology driven projections, succeeded in creating production quality rec-ommendations for majority of resource classes. This was also validated by the users from the study who rated the framework's usefulness as 4.27 out of 5. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The process of selecting Software as a Service (SaaS) in Cloud Computing depends on providers' capabilities to articulate the non-functional attributes of their SaaS offerings semantically and understand customer requests along with their non-functional requirements. This study conceptualizes SaaS selection as a multi-criteria combinatorial problem within predefined constraints. To address this, we introduce a hybrid approach incorporating an entire optimization algorithm. Our method leverages semantic and microservice (individual) SaaS descriptions in the Ontology Web Language for Services (OWL-S). Each micro SaaS is linked to compatible SaaS instances (offering similar functionality) in a unified environment, guided by the compatibility concept. A micro-SaaS may not satisfy a particular functional need in specific contexts. However, it is possible to meet customer requirements by combining the available SaaS instances, called virtual SaaS. The chosen SaaS should be the best based on the defined quality and quantitative criteria. Our proposed approach, employing multi-criteria analysis, capitalizes on a dedicated Quality of Service (QoS) ontology tailored for the cloud environment and web applications. Moreover, a simulation design proved that a substantial selection of SaaS(s) could be achieved in a cloud. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid growth of cloud computing, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained popularity. However, current MOOCs platforms encounter challenges in personalized learning due to disorganized resources, and the inability to capture dynamic learning demands. We present a dynamic scheduling system for multi-module cloud course resources using deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, a knowledge graph and conceptualization ability model are constructed to evaluate students' knowledge mastery levels. The dynamic demands are modeled as Markov Decision Processes, and optimized matching strategies are derived via deep Q-learning to satisfy personalized requirements. A reward function is designed to maximize students' knowledge conceptualization ability. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. This work provides a new intelligent solution to adaptively schedule cloud course resources. The core innovations lie in accurate dynamic modeling, and adaptive resource provisioning strategies for personalized learning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing prominence and progress of cloud computing has prompted data owners to delegate data management to cloud servers, leading to substantial cost reduction and enhanced accessibility. To address privacy concerns, sensitive data must be encrypted before outsourcing, which impairs usability and renders traditional plaintext-based keyword search techniques obsolete. Several search schemes based on encrypted data have been proposed. However, most of these schemes use inverted indexes and tree indexes, resulting in a linear correlation between the index size and the size of the keyword dictionary, which is insufficient in terms of search efficiency. In this paper, we propose a secure multi-keyword ranking search scheme based on Singular Value Decomposition technology to provide more precise and efficient results for secure multi-keyword ranking searches. Experimental results show that our scheme can save at least 50% of the time compared to the traditional indexing scheme. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The multi-dimensional cloud model is proposed as the expansion of the one-dimensional cloud model. The features of ambiguity and stochasticity in complex information situations are considered; thus, this optimized model can be utilized upon multiple value classifications and ordering via which the objects’ attributes of physical and social can be reflected. Therefore, this promoted model is wildly used. This paper provides a knowledge graph by reviewing the theoretical research of the multi-dimensional cloud model and its related bibliographies, and Cite Space is applied here to give a visualization conclusion. In recent years, a multitude of theories and methods have emerged to address the challenges posed by fuzzy and stochastic uncertainty in various domains, such as image segmentation, data mining, prediction techniques, and comprehensive evaluation of multiple metrics and dimensions using uncertain linguistic variables. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Computer vision and deep learning have made substantial progress in the areas of agriculture and smart farming, particularly for enhancing crop production using image segmentation techniques for crop yield prediction. Further improvements to crop yield prediction results can be achieved by developing accurate and efficient methods. In response to such demands, this paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network architecture, called densely connected SegNet (D-SegNet) and demonstrates its advantages on plant segmentation using a new morning glory plant dataset, and also on a complimentary publicly available dataset to promote research in this direction. The D-SegNet is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. It achieves performance better than the state-of-the-art SegNet algorithm. The evaluated precision, recall and F1-score values are 98.20%, 90.64% and 94.26%, respectively, for the morning glory plant dataset. The intersection over union (IoU) value in the image segmentation tasks is 90.56%. A series of experiments on the morning glory plant dataset as well as on the publicly available dataset were conducted. The results show that the proposed method achieves accurate segmentation results and can be useful for assessing the plant weight during harvesting. In summary, this new plant segmentation network, D-SegNet, could form an important component of future cloud-based machine learning systems to predict crop yield from noisy smartphone images taken in the field. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Most of the traditional privacy-preserving search schemes in cloud adopt TF-IDF model which is on the basis of keyword frequency statistics. The embedding semantic association between keywords and documents are not considered. To solve this problem, we propose a novel semantic-aware search scheme based on BCI-tree index over encrypted cloud data. The LDA model is adopted to generate vectors for documents and queried keywords and the vectors contain topic-based semantic information. The homomorphic encryption on vectors is used to perform privacy-preserving semantic relevance score computation between queried keywords and documents. To achieve efficient search processing, a novel binary clustering tree-based index (BCI-tree index) is designed, which is constructed following the divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm. By using the BCI-tree index, a depth-first recursive search algorithm is proposed. In addition, a threshold presetting-based optimization is applied to further accelerate the search speed. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme performs good in the semantic precision of search results and the search time cost. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior research has introduced a new scenario of blockchain-assisted clouds where the data owner outsources original data to cloud servers and stores some metadata on the blockchain. Despite some research on key-value query and range query in this hybrid-storage scenario, other more complicated data types are not yet supported. In this article, we conduct pioneering research on authenticated queries for graph data, which is a popular data type such as the knowledge graph data, on the blockchain-assisted cloud. The primary challenge is how to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) that supports authenticated queries and can be easily maintained by the blockchain. To this end, we propose a novel ADS, named PAGB, based on the RSA accumulator and completeness set. It can also prevent the original data from being revealed to the public through blockchain or irrelevant queries. We further optimize our design to be more efficient in terms of communication and computation. The effectiveness and efficiency of PAGB are verified through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advancements in cloud computing and distributed computing have fostered research activities in Computer science. As a result, researchers have made significant progress in Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computing Algorithms like Genetic, and Differential evolution algorithms. These algorithms are used to develop clustering, recommendation, and question-and-answering systems using various text representation and similarity measurement techniques. In this research paper, Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) is used to capture the semantic similarity of text; And the transfer learning technique is used to apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms to search and retrieve relevant top N documents based on user query. The proposed approach is applied to the Stanford Question and Answer (SQuAD) Dataset to identify a user query. Finally, through experiments, we prove that text documents can be efficiently represented as sentence embedding vectors using USE to capture the semantic similarity, and by comparing the results of the Manhattan Distance, GA, and DE algorithms we prove that the evolutionary algorithms are good at finding the top N results than the traditional ranking approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As medical services increasingly trying to harness advances in connected medical devices and the use of artificial intelligence, a new modeling strategy is essentially required to enable developers of the emerging medical applications to organize, integrate, and retain information in this new era of service-oriented healthcare. Such strategy needs to adhere to the principle of knowledge coupling that was advocated by Lawrence Weed, the father of modern problem-oriented medical records, in early 1970s where he defined the way medical information should be described for higher decision making. There has never been a more compelling time to use knowledge coupling related to both medical knowledge and the services build around them. The new digital technologies such as microservices, graph-based databases, Internet of Healthcare Things, and Cloud Computing as well as the non-digital disruptive events such as the pandemic have accelerated the adoption of new notions of service integration and knowledge coupling to provide the long waited solution for interoperability in healthcare as well as higher level of knowledge integration and analytics. The cornerstone of every new change is pointing toward the use of microservices and knowledge graph APIs to be able to thrive and lead in the uncertainty and healthcare change. This research paper uses the notion of mindmap to push conversation and guide scholars in developing effective microservice-based care systems that utilize knowledge graphs and the new care standards including the HL7 FHIR. Central to our mindmap is the GraphQL graph-based technology and the medical diagnosis as a service. This mindmap is the starting research point of our MITACS 2021 and NSERC DDG 2021 projects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration and remoteness of mobile terminals, as well as local area network-based office issues, have basically been solved, that is, a solution established on the basis of a cloud service collaborative platform, which can be implemented between various service systems. Each place enters the office system at all times to process related business, which improves the overall efficiency of our company's collaboration, and each information management system is no longer an information island. Technically, this article provides the possibility for the implementation of the system, and analyzes in detail the business requirements, performance requirements and functional modules of the system. In addition, it briefly introduces the requirements for the key technical means used. The system designed in this paper can effectively process a large amount of data and improve the operation efficiency of the system by separating the front-end management and back-end management. More importantly, the collaborative office platform designed by this system increases the sharing degree of information to the maximum, which can effectively reduce useless work, maximize work efficiency, and stimulate the enthusiasm of workers. At the same time, the operating costs of the system are reduced. It realizes the integration of information processing of data and efficient management of data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Telecommunications systems management represents a technical challenge with profound economic implications. Many different sources of information must be integrated, and complex decisions must be automatically taken and executed. In this article, we review the usage of knowledge graphs in this domain since they are a powerful tool for dealing with data integration and complex knowledge representation. The main insights are that they have been applied in several areas of telecommunications management, such as resource/service discovery and monitoring, with a particular focus on software-defined networks. Their main advantages are their extensibility and interoperability. However, data quality and graph performance are still challenges, and work is yet to be done for its application to the rest of the telecommunication management areas. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As RDF becomes more widely established and the amount of linked data is rapidly increasing, the efficient querying of large amount of data becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a family of algorithms for querying large amount of linked data in a distributed manner. These query evaluation algorithms are independent of the way the data is stored, as well as of the particular implementation of the query evaluation. We then use the MapReduce paradigm to present a distributed implementation of these algorithms and experimentally evaluate them, although the algorithms could be straightforwardly translated into other distributed processing frameworks. We also investigate and propose multiple query decomposition approaches of Basic Graph Patterns (subclass of SPARQL queries) that are used to improve the overall performance of the distributed query answering. A deep analysis of the effectiveness of these decomposition algorithms is also provided. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Various stages of highway project construction process involve text, image, audio, video and other related data sources involving many participants, forming a huge amount of data. Accurately tracing the source of responsibility, refining and applying the unbalanced data in the highway project archives is of great significance for realizing the intelligent transformation of highway construction project management. This paper firstly sorts out the construction process of highway projects and the main data sources, constructs a data association network between construction entities and construction process, as well as a knowledge map of highway construction data. Then, according to the highway construction stage, an index system based on 12 key data is constructed by using the entropy weight cloud model method, and the importance of the data is evaluated. Thirdly, based on the unbalanced characteristics of highway project data, a method of mining big data in highway project archives using classification evaluation indexes is proposed, and the accuracy of this method is verified by case calculation. Finally, taking the Shizong Qiubei Expressway in China as an example, the intelligent management and control suggestions for key data of transportation projects are proposed. It is found that the key data with special importance rate in highway construction include construction data, supervision data and completion data. Boosting algorithm is more accurate than the traditional SMOTE algorithm for unbalanced data mining, which helps to save the project construction cost and improve the quality of data extraction in the project archives. This study provides a theoretical reference for key data traceability of highway project intelligent management and control platform and the improvement of intelligent management efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Continuous certification of cloud services requires a high degree of automation in collecting and evaluating evidences. Prior approaches to this topic are often specific to a cloud provider or a certain certification catalog. This makes it costly and complex to achieve conformance to multiple certification schemes and covering multi-cloud solutions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to continuous certification which is scheme- and vendor-independent. Leveraging an ontology of cloud resources and their security features, we generalize vendor- and scheme-specific terminology into a new model of so-called semantic evidence. In combination with generalized metrics that we elicited out of requirements from the EUCS and the CCMv4, we present a framework for the collection and assessment of such semantic evidence across multiple cloud providers. This allows to conduct continuous cloud certification while achieving re-usability of metrics and evidences in multiple certification schemes. The performance benchmark of the framework's prototype implementation shows that up to 200,000 evidences can be processed in less than a minute, making it suitable for short time intervals used in continuous certification. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: This study aims to identify endoplasmic reticulum stress response elements (ERSE) in the human genome to explore potentially regulated genes, including kinases and transcription factors, involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and its related diseases. Materials and methods: Python-based whole genome screening of ERSE was performed using the Amazon Web Services elastic computing system. The Kinome database was used to filter out the kinases from the extracted list of ERSE-related genes. Additionally, network analysis and genome enrichment were achieved using NDEx, the Network and Data Exchange software, and web-based computational tools. To validate the gene expression, quantitative RT-PCR was performed for selected kinases from the list by exposing the HeLa cells to tunicamycin and brefeldin, ER stress inducers, for various time points. Key findings: The overall number of ERSE-associated genes follows a similar pattern in humans, mice, and rats, demonstrating the ERSE's conservation in mammals. A total of 2705 ERSE sequences were discovered in the human genome (GRCh38.p14), from which we identified 36 kinases encoding genes. Gene expression analysis has shown a significant change in the expression of selected genes under ER stress conditions in HeLa cells, supporting our finding. Significance: In this study, we have introduced a rapid method using Amazon cloud-based services for genome-wide screening of ERSE sequences from both positive and negative strands, which covers the entire genome reference sequences. Approximately 10 % of human protein-protein interactomes were found to be associated with ERSE-related genes. Our study also provides a rich resource of human ER stress-response-based protein networks and transcription factor interactions and a reference point for future research aiming at targeted therapeutics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Wintershall Dea and IBM co-developed the Exploration Advisory Tool (EAT), a domain-specific cognitive search platform, to overcome the challenge of timely evaluating large unstructured data. EAT composes of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline that is trained to ingest a large number of prioritized document types by extracting texts, images and tables from these documents. Within text paragraphs, pre-defined geological concepts are identified using Named Entity Recognition (NER). Geological concepts such as ‘Seal’ or ‘Volumes’, which can have a broader meaning, are recognized within the geological context using transformers, rules, and dictionaries. Structuring of the information is done by means of a knowledge graph, where the nodes are formed by the geological concepts and the edges are defined by relationships between these concepts. The high-performance knowledge graph is used to search and explore the documents via the EAT user interface enhanced by a GIS-type mapping. EAT was developed within the DevOps and MLOps frameworks. The team has been working agile employing collaborative and incremental delivery using a more or less automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on a multi-cloud and hybrid environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the continuous development of artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has created new opportunities for intelligent applications. However, large language models may lack authenticity and accuracy when providing answers in specific professional domains, and they even generate "illusory facts." In response to the limitations of current large language models in solving specific professional fields, this paper proposes to use large language models and knowledge graph technology to construct an intelligent question answering system for specific fields. Through systematic training and optimization, efficient domain specific knowledge Q&A has been achieved, improving the satisfaction rate of domain specific knowledge Q&A. The intelligent question answering system based on large models and knowledge graphs brings more convenience to people's lives and work, which is beneficial for users to obtain intelligent solutions in fields such as education, healthcare, and customer service. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hybrid intelligence has emerged as an innovative approach that synergistically combines the strengths of human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI) to address complex problems. In this paradigm, knowledge graphs play a pivotal role by supplying vital background information and contextual understanding to hybrid intelligence systems. However, due to limitations in local storage capacity, managing large-scale graph data often requires outsourcing to cloud servers. Nevertheless, the use of untrusted cloud servers poses a risk of potential user data leaks. To address these concerns, this paper presents an encryption scheme specifically designed to protect graph data, enabling queries involving intermediate nodes in the shortest path between two nodes within the graph. The proposed scheme ensures the privacy and security of outsourced data by employing a novel method that utilizes padding dictionary structure encryption. This method ensures strict limitations on the cloud server's capabilities, restricting it solely to query operations, it effectively prevents any compromise of user data or unauthorized access to sensitive information, users can securely store and process their graph data on servers, significantly reducing the potential risk of data leakage and unauthorized breaches. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution, practical experiments were conducted using real-world data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Scalable solutions are required to handle fluctuating workloads in modern distribution grids in order to manage the flood of data from many sources, execute dynamic algorithms as needed, and effectively operate sparse actuators. In order to meet these needs, cloud computing technologies have surfaced as a suitable answer, facilitating effective data sharing and interchange. With semantic information integration playing a crucial role, this is especially important for fully exploiting the advantages of cloud computing in enabling sophisticated analytics and mining for smart grids. In order to analyze grid data for power distribution, this essay proposes integrating the semantic web into a cloud-based research platform. The idea recommends using a service restoration technique to reenergize loads after an electrical failure. This presentation is implemented using FIWARE, a platform composed of modular, open-source building pieces designed for future internet services and applications. Moreover, the SARGON ontology-which was created especially for the energy domain-is used here. We test the integration of semantic data into the cloud-based service restoration application using the IEC61850 data model. This integration provides an access to the distribution grid's field devices. The platform's performance test, measured in terms of computing time and network latency, validates the viability of the suggested solution. The results of these experiments provide as a standard against which to measure the performance of smart energy platforms in the future, therefore advancing the field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing offers more advantages to clients and associations regarding capital uses and working cost investment funds. This study gives an ontological model of the cloud fabricating space to help with the data trade between the cloud-producing assets. The ideas of the proposed model depend on a writing survey of models of the cloud and models of assembling. In the research article, the problem addressed is how cloud brokers are providing cloud services in an efficient way to cloud users. It is the main prologue to an ontology-based, process-situated, and specialist framework that is autonomous of a society that permits most associations to utilize it. The rising number of cloud providers, the nonappearance of interoperability, and the heterogeneity in current open cloud stages lead to the requirement for creative frameworks to track down the foremost fitting cloud resource plan as successfully and mechanized as may be anticipated. In this paper, we depicted the building arrangement of a cloud organization made of two agreeable modules. The Cloud Agency’s objective is to naturally secure assets from suppliers on the premise of SLA evaluation rules and find the foremost reasonable cloud supplier that fulfills users’ prerequisites, and the Semantic Motor’s objective is to make a rationalist depiction of assets based on users’ benefit prerequisites and a brokering framework. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The proliferation of information is increasing on a daily basis; however, it is often accompanied by issues of irrelevance and inadequate security measures. It is imperative to minimize time complexity by furnishing pertinent outcomes to users, thereby enabling them to access cloud services directly in accordance with the pay-per-use policy. The study presents an algorithm that utilizes ontology to execute encryption and decryption of input data within a cloud environment that caters to multiple tenants. The process entails the categorization of categories, attributes, and examples of unstructured language through the creation of an ontology that pertains to a particular field. The ontology has been developed utilizing the Protégé ontology editor and facilitates the retrieval of pertinent information from cloud service providers through a pay-per-use model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - —This paper focuses on semantic interoperability as one of the most significant issues in multi-cloud platforms. Organizations and individuals that adopt the multi-cloud strategy often use various cloud services and platforms. On top of that, cloud service providers may offer a range of services with unique data formats, structures, and semantics. Hence, semantic interoperability is required to enable applications and services to understand and use data consistently, regardless of the cloud service providers. The main goal of this study is to propose a reference architecture for semantic interoperability in multicloud platforms. Towards achieving the main goal, this paper presents two main contributions. First contribution is an extended cloud computing interoperability taxonomy, with semantic approach as one of the solutions for facilitating semantic cloud interoperability. Two fundamental semantic approaches have been identified, namely semantic technologies and frameworks which will be adopted as the main building blocks. Semantic technologies, such as ontologies, can be used to represent the semantics or meanings of data. Data may be reliably represented across multiple cloud platforms by employing a common ontology. This promotes semantic interoperability by ensuring that data is interpreted and processed uniformly within diverse cloud platforms. On the other hand, a framework offers a standardized and organized way for managing, exchanging, and representing data and services. For the second contribution of this paper, a review of recent (2018-2023) related works has been conducted by investigating the state-of-the-art of semantic interoperability in multi-cloud platforms. As a result, the proposed solution will be implemented in the context of a reference architecture. The reference architecture will act as a blueprint to systematically represent semantic interoperability in multi-cloud platforms using a hybrid approach of role-based and layer-based. Additionally, a semantic layer will be extended to the reference architecture to facilitate semantic interoperability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to apply knowledge graph construction techniques to textbooks, explicitly focusing on the challenge of the absence of domain-specific schema for each textbook. Various entity and relation extraction models are utilized to capture logical and semantic information related to the textbook s topic. These models include a Text-Encoding-Initiative (TEI) model to extract hierarchical concepts, spaCy Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Google Cloud Natural Language to extract semantic information from the main textual content. The study includes a case study on a cloud computing textbook, where each approach is evaluated and analyzed. Ultimately, the goal is to create knowledge graphs of textbooks, enabling the completion task of predicting missing entities or relations in a low-dimensional space. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper deals with issues of designing and creating knowledge bases in the field of nuclear science and technology. The authors present the results of searching for and testing optimal classification and semantic annotation algorithms applied to the textual network content for the convenience of computer-aided filling and updating of scalable semantic repositories (knowledge bases) in the field of nuclear physics and nuclear power engineering and, in the future, for other subject areas, both in Russian and English. The proposed algorithms will provide a methodological and technological basis for creating problem-oriented knowledge bases as artificial intelligence systems, as well as prerequisites for the development of semantic technologies for acquiring new knowledge on the Internet without direct human participation. Testing of the studied machine learning algorithms is carried out by the cross-validation method using corpora of spe-cialized texts. The novelty of the presented study lies in the application of the Pareto optimality principle for multi-cri-teria evaluation and ranking of the studied algorithms in the absence of a priori information about the comparative significance of the criteria. The project is implemented in accordance with the Semantic Web standards (RDF, OWL, SPARQL, etc.). There are no technological restrictions for integrating the created knowledge bases with third-party data repositories as well as metasearch, library, reference or information and question-answer systems. The proposed software solutions are based on cloud computing using DBaaS and PaaS service models to ensure the scalability of data warehouses and network services. The created software is in the public domain and can be freely replicated. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It is difficult for users to understand the complex cloud product information for product selection. Using this information to recommend satisfactory cloud products is a challenge. Previous studies focused on similar information of users and products while neglecting relevance; therefore, they could not create recommendation approaches that account for functional dependencies among cloud products. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a cloud product set recommendation model based on a hierarchical knowledge graph (KG) with a pre-post correlation of product functionality. There are two main contributions: First, we constructed a cloud product functionality and performance KG using the dependency information of layers and entities to represent complicated pre-post logical connections. The KG was designed according to the cloud service model. Second, we designed an improved PageRank algorithm to obtain the importance weight for each functionality and performance, which replaces the original average method with the proportion of connection weight. We considered the release time of the functionality, launch time of the product, and last update time of the product as crucial factors in the recommendation score to reflect the importance of the functionality and current development stage of the product. Finally, our method recommended a product set based on the weighted scores from the above results. In addition, we constructed a cloud product functionality dataset containing 339 functionalities. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate a closely related set of products, leading to improved accuracy and higher satisfaction compared to mainstream methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Digital Twin (DT) provides a digital representation of a physical system and allows users to interactively study the physical processes of a real system via the digital representation in different scenarios in real time. The development of a DT is highly complex; it requires not only expertise from multiple disciplines but also the integration of often heterogeneous software components, e.g., simulations, machine learning, visualization, and user interface components across distributed environments. This poster presents a Knowledge Graph-based ontological framework to boost automation and collaboration during the DT lifecycle stages. We implement our methods in developing a what-if analysis service for a DT of an ecosystem of wetlands and its automated deployment to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increasing development of cloud computing, a large number of innovative Mashup applications and Web APIs have emerged on the Internet. The expansion of technology and information presents a significant challenge to the discovery of Web APIs from multiple service ecosystems. Various Web API recommendation methods have been proposed in mashup creation, but most either assign equal weight to model factorization interactions or solely rely on requirements information for API recommendation. Unfortunately, these methods face several challenges, such as explicit and implicit dependencies among APIs, ambiguous API semantics, and the undervaluation of tail APIs. In this work, we propose a Functional and Structural Fusion Model (FSFM) based on Web API recommendation for Mashup creation. To address the above deficiencies, we first design the structural interaction component to encode the latent structural relationships in the heterogeneous network of Mashups and APIs and capture the topological structure signals between different Mashups and APIs. Then, we introduce the functional semantic component to generate text embedding vectors for Mashups and APIs, enhancing their requirement semantics at multiple levels of abstraction. Finally, we fuse the output vectors to obtain the list of candidate Web APIs. Experiences are performed on real datasets, and statistical results show that FSFM outperforms other state-of-the-art models in both overall and long-tail Web API recommendations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to address the existing data security and user privacy vulnerabilities in the “cloud” environment, which is essential for ensuring the safety and integrity of data in the era of big data and cloud computing. To achieve this purpose, we propose a novel approach that combines the logit link function with a longitudinal joint learning framework for the gamma regression model. This approach enhances the application of the model and the loss function, providing a robust solution for data security and user privacy in cloud-based systems. While cloud computing technology has greatly improved the convenience of work and life, it has also introduced significant challenges related to data security and user privacy. This study leverages semantic web technology and blockchain technology to establish a distributed and credit-guaranteed product quality and safety traceability application. By designing a concept verification system and ensuring data integrity at each stage of the product supply chain, this approach addresses these challenges effectively.

AB  - Discontinuous data is a kind of large-scale hierarchical data. Generally speaking, this kind of data has time attribute, and it hopes to show some time-varying characteristics on the basis of keeping the hierarchical structure clear. Using path mining to analyze discontinuous data paths in cloud computing environment, we can find the location and data state of discontinuous data paths. Classifying and counting discontinuous data is beneficial to the efficient use of data. In this paper, the optimization of discontinuous data path mining based on fuzzy clustering algorithm is studied. In order to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, this paper extracts the semantic directional features of discontinuous data and quantifies them. On the basis of quantization coding, FCM (fuzzy C means) algorithm is adopted to realize the directional beam clustering of semantic ontology features and improve the path mining algorithm. The research results show that the proposed algorithm is used to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, and the root mean square error of the path mining output is low, which shows that the path mining accuracy is higher than the traditional method and the anti-interference performance is strong. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to systematically review geospatial mapping and 3D virtual space networking tools, visual object tracking and deep learning algorithms, and cloud computing and cognitive artificial intelligence technologies. The findings and analyses highlight that extended reality environments require sensor fusion and 3D path planning algorithms, synthetic biometric data, and ontology-based semantic and 3D immersive virtual reality technologies. Throughout April 2023, a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases was performed, with search terms including “the blockchain-based metaverse” + “context awareness and deep learning algorithms,” “immersive visualization and autonomous cognitive systems,” and “natural language processing and digital twin modeling tools.” As research published in 2022 and 2023 was in-spected, only 181 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. By taking out controversial or ambiguous findings (insufficient/irrelevant data), outcomes unsubstantiated by replication, too general material, or studies with nearly identical titles, I selected 30 mainly empirical sources. Data visualization tools: Dimensions (bibliometric mapping) and VOSviewer (layout algorithms). Reporting quality assessment tool: PRISMA. Methodological quality assessment tools include: AMSTAR, Dedoose, Distiller SR, and SRDR. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the construction of the new power system, the installed proportion of the traditional synchronous generator continues to decline, and the stability of the grid voltage is greatly challenged. The participation of wind power in the emergency reactive power control after grid failure is faced with an urgent need. Aiming at the problem that it is difficult to take into account both the ontology constraint and the active power uncertainty constraint when the doubly-fed induction generator participates in the emergency reactive power control of the power grid, the influence mechanism of different reactive power output modes of the DFIG on the system reactive voltage sensitivity is analyzed, and the emergency reactive power support capacity of the wind power is divided into two levels: the turbine ontology constraint and the active power uncertainty constraint, The cloud model entropy is used to quantitatively describe the probability and uncertainty of wind farm output power, so as to determine the limit of reactive power support capacity of wind farm in real time. When the power grid is subject to voltage disturbance, the maximum reactive voltage support can be implemented to reduce the system transient overvoltage or low voltage without affecting the consumption of clean energy. It is verified by the simulation of the actual power grid. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Now-a-days cloud computing is growing exponentially and the preference to cloud services is increasing day by day due to their cost saving benefits. These services mostly seem to be significantly identical in their functionality except their key attributes like storage, computational power, price etc. Till now there is no uniform specification for defining a service in cloud domain. In order to specify the identical operations and publish the services on the websites, different cloud service providers tend to use completely different vocabulary. The process of requesting for a cloud service becomes merely challenging task. Hence, a reasoning mechanism is immensely essential for service discovery that could resolve the resemblance appearing across different services by inferring with the respective cloud ontology. In this paper, an effective mechanism has been proposed using ontology for most relevant cloud service discovery and selection using a distributed cloud application platform called Aneka PaaS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Existing Cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) services face challenges in handling heterogeneous data and maintaining performance with large records since they often use a relational database or only partially store information in a graph database. We have developed a novel approach that allows fine-grained field-level security for Cloud EHRs to protect patient privacy and data security. Our graph-based EHR has been developed by integrating Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) with ontology reasoning using Semantic Web technologies. The novelty of our approach lies in providing differential access to an EHR by using a comprehensive knowledge graph that stores all medical data as encrypted nodes, thereby handling heterogeneous patient data while preserving good performance. In this paper, we describe our system in detail, along with the results demonstrating that the system maintains consistent data retrieval performance with different data sizes and allows real-time updates on the data while supporting queries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: The paper deals with the issues of finding and researching optimum algorithms for classification and semantic annotation of textual network content in the interests of filling and updating nuclear knowledge graphs in Russian and English. Testing of the studied algorithms is carried out by the method of cross-validation. The novelty of the presented research is due to the application of the Pareto’s optimality principle for multi-criteria evaluation and ranking of the studied machine learning algorithms, provided that there is no a priori information about the comparative importance of the criteria. The features of the software implementation of efficient classification and semantic annotation algorithms as part of a scalable semantic web portal hosted on a cloud platform are discussed. The proposed software solutions are based on cloud computing using DBaaS and PaaS service models to ensure the scalability of data warehouses and network services. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Edge computing is a modern approach that may be considered as collecting and processing data near the source of its generation with further cloud computing. Therefore, the data processing that collected distributed and further collected at the central level may be considered an edge-based approach. NARCIS, SICRIS, and Research.fi systems exist to store and process scientific data in different countries of Europe, but in Ukraine, such a system is absent. The study foresees using the data collected in different instructions with its processing and collecting in a central database related to academic events. The list of relevant data stored in the academic events system and case diagram of the proposed system is developed. The essential EU legislation documents that should be considered are named. The list of systems that are proposed to provide interoperability with is investigated and described. Models' of receiving data, URIS as the main component of the decentralized approach in science, data exchange and interaction of proposed data base were illustrated and described. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article discusses the problem of implementing the Data Fabric architecture as a technology for sustainable data processing and storage for the modernization of industrial platforms in transport and road systems. To perform complex tasks like monitoring road transport facilities entails huge resources for storing interactive data online. The concept of transport enterprises moving to cloud systems opens up gaps in data management in hybrid and multi-cloud systems. To solve such problems, the implementation of the Data Fabric structure allows you to integrate data and metadata for use on various platforms. The sustainable development of such platforms is facilitated by the use of the Data Fabric mechanism as a built-in system for standardization and coding, the implementation of semantic compatibility, proprietary knowledge graphs and the domain of data values of the transport industry. Data Fabric helps organizations solve complex data problems and use cases by managing their data regardless of application types, platforms, and storage locations, while ensuring seamless data access and sharing in a distributed data environment. The article analyzes the stability of the Data Fabric platform as a domain-oriented decomposition model based on a distributed data architecture with centralized management, but not as a fragmented data warehouse. Using the example of such a decomposition, it is necessary to model an architecture that organizes analytical and other data by areas. In this architecture, the domain's interface with the rest of the organization includes not only operational capabilities, but also access to the analytical data that the domain serves to scale the system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In academic institutions, there is frequently the need to provide new services, in a cloud model, to be used either in teaching or in research activities. One of the main decisions to be addressed is related to the cloud model to adopt (private, public or hybrid), and what mixing of functionalities to use for the hybrid one. In this paper two different methodologies (cost/features and semantic-based) are been experimented in order to identify the best suited cloud model to adopt for a specific problem. The long-term perspective is to build a methodology to serve as a tool to be used as decision support for the ICT manager in order to help him in this decision. The comparison between the two different methodologies shows the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ontologies have become the de-facto information representation method in the semantic web domain, but recently gained popularity in other domains such as cloud computing. In this context, ontologies enable service discovery, effective comparison and selection of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS offerings and ease the application deployment process by tackling what is known as the vendor lock-in problem. In this paper we propose a novel ontology named HOCC: holistic ontology for effective cluster comparison. The ontology design process is based on four different information categories, namely Performance, SLA, cost and environmental impact. In addition we present our approach for populating, managing and taking advantage of the proposed ontology as developed in a real world Kubernetes cluster setting, as well as instantiating the ontology with example services and data (namely performance aspects of a serverless function). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Web services are products in the era of service-oriented computing and cloud computing. As the number of web services on the Internet grows, selecting and recommending them becomes more important. Consequently, in the realm of service computing, how to propose the finest Web services for researchers is now a popular research topic. To determine the proper recommendation, the BI-CSem model was proposed and tested with multiple baseline models using real-world Web Service datasets in this research. Aside from that, thesaurus is built using Web service keywords gathered from Web service repositories such as UDDI,WSDI, and from the World Wide Web Cloud. The extracted terms are then subjected to semantic similarity, which is determined using SemantoSim, Concept similarity, and KL divergence measure, and the terms from the user, such as query, user click, and previous historical data, are pre-processed the terms from the semantic alignment are then classified using XGBoost, while the Web service dataset is classified using XGBoost and GRU. Semantic similarity is determined using just SemantoSim, based on the classification intersection of the top 75 percent words from the extracted terms from the two classifiers and features from the created intermediate term tree generated using STM. Finally, terms are reranked and recommended to the user, and the precision, accuracy, recall, F-measure, and FDR for the Web service recommendation system are calculated, and the Bi-CSem model is found to have an excellent precision percentage of 94.37% and the lowest FDR of 0.06. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Most of the traditional privacy-preserving search schemes adopt TF-IDF model which is on the basis of keyword frequency statistics. The embedding semantic association between keywords and documents are not considered. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient semantic-aware privacy-preserving multi-keyword search scheme over encrypted cloud data. The LDA topic model is adopted to generate the topic information-embedded vectors for documents and queried keywords. The homomorphic encryption on vectors is used to perform privacy-preserving semantic relevance score computation between queried keywords and documents. To achieve efficient search processing, a novel tree-based index is designed, which is constructed following the divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm. By using the tree-based index, a depth-first privacy-preserving multi-keyword search algorithm is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of the semantic precision of search results and the search time cost. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the continuous development of cloud computing and storage, searchable encryption as a key technology has attracted wide attention. However, existing statistical-based models face long document feature vectors and can not fully catch the document semantics information. This leads to inefficient and unsatisfactory retrieval results. In this paper, we propose a deep structured semantic model of ranked search over encrypted data (DSRSE) based on a convolutional neural network for the first time. In this scheme, document index vectors and query trapdoors are generated by the convolutional neural network model (CNNM) and encrypted by the secure kNN algorithm. In order to protect documents’ privacy security, we use private cloud servers to train the CNNM distributively. All parameters are updated constantly, and the CNNM is updated regularly. Furthermore, a clustering tree based index structure is proposed. Through inner product of document vectors, semantically similar files are clustered together for building a bottom-up index tree which enhances the retrieval efficiency. Analysis and experiments on real datasets illustrate that our schemes perform well in terms of privacy security, search efficiency and accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Consumers evaluate and choose cloud-based services based on the Service Level Agreements (SLA). These agreements list the service terms and metrics to be agreed upon by the service providers and the customers. Current cloud SLAs are text documents that require significant manual effort to parse and determine if providers meet the SLAs. Moreover, due to the lack of standardization, providers differ in the way they define the terms and metrics, making it more difficult to compare different provider SLAs. We have developed a novel framework to significantly automate the process of extracting knowledge embedded in cloud SLAs and representing it in a semantically rich knowledge graph helping the user to make a calculated decision in choosing a provider. Our framework captures the key terms, measures, and deontic rules, in the form of obligations and permissions present in the cloud SLAs. In this article, we discuss our framework, technique, and challenges in automating the cloud services agreement. We also describe our results and their validation against well-established standards. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: As an important part of metabolomics analysis, untargeted metabolomics has become a powerful tool in the study of tumor mechanisms and the discovery of metabolic markers with high-throughput spectrometric data which also poses great challenges to data analysis, from the extraction of raw data to the identification of differential metabolites. To date, a large number of analytical tools and processes have been developed and constructed to serve untargeted metabolomics research. The different selection of analytical tools and parameter settings lead to varied results of untargeted metabolomics data. Our goal is to establish an easily operated platform and obtain a repeatable analysis result. Methods: We used the R language basic environment to construct the preprocessing system of the original data and the LAMP (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP) architecture to build a cloud mass spectrum data analysis system. Results: An open-source analysis software for untargeted metabolomics data (openNAU) was constructed. It includes the extraction of raw mass data and quality control for the identification of differential metabolic ion peaks. A reference metabolomics database based on public databases was also constructed. Conclusions: A complete analysis system platform for untargeted metabolomics was established. This platform provides a complete template interface for the addition and updating of the analysis process, so we can finish complex analyses of untargeted metabolomics with simple human-computer interactions.

AB  - Variable logging plays a vital role in software service management. Developers usually print a set of selected variables in logs to record software system status. Due to the lack of strict logging instructions and domain-specific knowledge, it is challenging for developers to decide which variables to log. Therefore, a technology that enables developers to log high- quality log variables is desirable. There are two reasons that make such a technology feasible. First, there exists semantic relevance between logged variables and other code statements. Second, the structural relationship between variables helps technology learn more information. In this paper, we propose a novel method to recommend variables to log - given a code snippet that needs to be followed by a logging statement, our method will tag every token in this code snippet to indicate whether it should be logged. Our method utilizes a pre-trained model to encode semantic information and a graph neural network to encode graph structure information. Given a code snippet without logging statements, our method first extracts graph structure information by graph neural network, then fuses the graph structure information with semantic information extracted by the pre-trained model to recommend logging variables. We use nine open-source projects' java files to evaluate our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of Hits@1, MRR, and MAP, which indicate that the quality of the first recommended variable and all recommended variables is superior to other baseline models. Moreover this benefits from encoding better semantic information and incorporating graph structure information. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cost-effective on-demand computing resources can help to process the increasing number of large, diverse datasets generated from smart internet-enabled technology, such as sensors, CCTV cameras, and mobile devices, with high temporal resolution. Category 1 emergency services (Ambulance, Fire and Rescue, and Police) can benefit from access to (near) real-time traffic- and weather data to coordinate multiple services, such as reassessing a route on the transport network affected by flooding or road incidents. However, there is a tendency not to utilise available smart city data sources, due to the heterogeneous data landscape, lack of real-time information, and communication inefficiencies. Using a systems engineering approach, we identify the current challenges faced by stakeholders involved in incident response and formulate future requirements for an improved system. Based on these initial findings, we develop a use case using Microsoft Azure cloud computing technology for analytical functionalities that can better support stakeholders in their response to an incident. Our prototype allows stakeholders to view available resources, send automatic updates and integrate location-based real-time weather and traffic data. We anticipate our study will provide a foundation for the future design of a data ontology for multi-agency incident response in smart cities of the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, the multi-cloud environment is gaining a momentum since it provides its users with reduced costs, greater flexibility and elasticity, high availability and better fault-tolerance. Despite these advantages, these environments present many challenges, including service management and interoperability issues. Due to the diversity of cloud service providers, their heterogeneity and the exponential growth of offered services, user requirements cannot be adequately met. These problems, if not addressed effectively, can have a negative impact on the cloud environment as well as on the user experience. Thus, to answer the service management problem in multi-cloud environments, we propose in this paper a threefold contribution (i) a noval cloud federation architecture, (ii) a suitable service management system and (iii) a service publication algorithm in order to manage, store and retrieve efficiently cloud services within the federation. Our solution consists in combining several concepts including trust, clustering and , ontologies. Our aim is to automate the management process, maximise the profit and ensure a better user experience. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of the proposed cloud federation architecture as well as the deployed management system in optimizing the storage space and answering effectively and rapidly users’ requests. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Big data technology has triggered a boom in research and applications around the world. The construction industry has ushered in a new technological change in this context. Researchers have conducted in-depth research on the intersection of big data and architecture, but lack quantitative analysis and comprehensive evaluation of the research results. This article draws a series of knowledge maps with the help of the CiteSpace software using the relevant literature in the Web of Science database between 2007 and 2022 as data samples to comprehensively grasp the research development at the intersection of big data and the construction industry. The knowledge base, research hotspots, and domain evolution trends in the intersection of big data and the construction industry are analyzed quantitatively and aided by qualitative analysis through visualization, respectively. The results show that Chinese and American scholars have published more relevant papers in international journals, and some well-known universities in both countries constitute the main group of research institutions. The research hotspots are BIM, data mining, building energy saving, smart cities, and disaster prevention and damage prevention. In the future, the research on the integration and application of the construction industry with emerging technologies, such as big data, BIM, and cloud computing will be connected more closely. This study provides a preliminary overall picture of the research of big data in the field of construction by sorting out and analyzing the existing results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional term frequency-inverse document frequency model-based privacy-preserving ranked search schemes rarely consider the latent semantic meanings of documents and keywords. It is a challenge to design efficient semantic-aware ranked search (SRSE) schemes with privacy preservation. In this paper, two privacy-preserving SRSE schemes are developed for the cloud environments. The first scheme is the accuracy-first search scheme. In this scheme, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model is adopted to generate the topic-based semantic information-embedded vectors for documents and queried keywords, which supports semantic-aware relevance measurement. The bisecting k-means clustering algorithm is used to build an accuracy-first filtering tree index (AFF-tree), and the AFF-tree-based search algorithm is proposed to achieve the accuracy-first ranked search. The second scheme is the efficiency-first search scheme. It performs a structure optimization on the AFF-tree, and a newly efficiency-first filtering tree index (EFF-tree) is designed. By using the EFF-tree, an anchor node-based search algorithm is designed to achieve the efficiency-first ranked search at the expense of a little decrease in search result precision. The secure inner product is used to perform privacy-preserving semantic-aware relevance measurement between documents and queried keywords in both schemes. To analyze the security of the proposed schemes, the game stimulation-based proof is presented. Experimental results show the better performance of the proposed schemes in search time cost. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ranked keyword search has gained Ranked keyword search has gained traction due to its attractive properties such as flexibility and accessibility. However, most existing ranked keyword search schemes ignore the semantic associations between the documents and queries. To solve this challenging issue in cloud-assisted edge computing, we first design the Semantic-aware Ranked Multi-keyword Search (SRMS) scheme by adopting the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)-based secret sharing mechanism. Considering that the cloud server may be malicious, we implement a basic verification mechanism in SRMS to verify the correctness and completeness of search results and extend this verification mechanism in cloud-assisted edge computing scenarios. Formal security analysis proves that SRMS and extended result verification mechanisms are secure in both the known ciphertext model and the known background model. Extensive experiments using the real-world dataset demonstrate that SRMS is efficient and practical. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud technologies have several merits including the elimination of cost incurred when traditional technologies are adopted. Despite the benefits, the cloud is still facing security challenges thereby calling for cyber threat intelligence capable of identifying threats and providing possible solutions. However, dependence on traditional security mechanisms and approaches for security solutions within cloud environments presents challenges. This calls for cloud-native solutions which leverages cloud features for design and development of solutions for data and applications hosted and running within the cloud. Past studies have suggested the adoption of semantic technologies for cloud-based security mechanisms. However, the semantic processing of data faces challenges of data interconnectedness due to aggregation of data from diverse heterogenous sources. Hence, this study proposes a cloud-native architecture capable of connecting security-related data from different sources in the cloud to enhance cyber threat intelligence. It presents a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed solution on Amazon AWS cloud, within an auto-scaling group for scalability and across multiple availability zones for high availability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional searchable encryption schemes based on the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model adopt the presence of keywords to measure the relevance of documents to queries, which ignores the latent semantic meanings that are concealed in the context. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model can be utilized for modeling the semantics among texts to achieve semantic-aware multi-keyword search. However, the LDA topic model treats queries and documents from the perspective of topics, and the keywords information is ignored. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving searchable encryption scheme based on the LDA topic model and the query likelihood model. We extract the feature keywords from the document using the LDA-based Information Gain (IG) and Topic Frequency-Inverse Topic Frequency (TF-ITF) model. With feature keyword extraction and the query likelihood model, our scheme can achieve a more accurate semantic-aware keyword search. A special index tree is used to enhance search efficiency. The secure inner product operation is utilized to implement the privacy-preserving ranked search. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Along with the development of information technologies such as mobile Internet, information acquisition technology, cloud computing and big data technology, the traditional knowledge engineering and knowledge-based software engineering have undergone fundamental changes where the network plays an increasingly important role. Within this context, it is required to develop new methodologies as well as technical tools for network-based knowledge representation, knowledge services and knowledge engineering. Obviously, the term 'network' has different meanings in different scenarios. Meanwhile, some breakthroughs in several bottleneck problems of complex networks promote the developments of the new methodologies and technical tools for network-based knowledge representation, knowledge services and knowledge engineering. This paper first reviews some recent advances on complex networks, and then, in conjunction with knowledge graph, proposes a framework of networked knowledge which models knowledge and its relationships with the perspective of complex networks. For the unique advantages of deep learning in acquiring and processing knowledge, this paper reviews its development and emphasizes the role that it played in the development of knowledge engineering. Finally, some challenges and further trends are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The move from boxed products to services and the widespread adoption of cloud computing has had a huge impact on the software development life cycle and DevOps processes. Particularly, incident management has become critical for developing and operating large-scale services. Prior work on incident management has heavily focused on the challenges with incident triaging and de-duplication. In this work, we address the fundamental problem of structured knowledge extraction from service incidents. We have built SoftNER, a framework for mining Knowledge Graphs from incident reports. First, we build a novel multi-task learning based BiLSTM-CRF model which leverages not just the semantic context but also the data-types for extracting factual information in the form of named entities. Next, we present an approach to mine relations between the named entities for automatically constructing knowledge graphs. We have deployed SoftNER at Microsoft, a major cloud service provider and have evaluated it on more than 2 months of cloud incidents. We show that SoftNER’s unsupervised pipeline learns the software entity types from unstructured incident data with high precision of 0.96 (at rank 50) and 0.77 (at rank 100). We also evaluate and show that SoftNER’s unsupervised pipeline accurately labels data with a precision of 0.94. Further, our multi-task learning based deep learning model also outperforms the state-of-the-art NER models with an average F1 of 0.96. Lastly, using the knowledge extracted by SoftNER, we are able to build accurate models for tasks such as incident triaging and recommending entities based on their relevance to incident titles. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Much like other processing domains, cloud computing is not surely safe. Security of cloud processing needs the same attention as any other aspect of cloud processing requires. Cyber world is shifting toward ontological technique and web 3.0 or web semantics for security. Cloud hosts servers demand more attention in context of security as number of resources and their access increases. Security measures have to be more extensive in cloud. Semantic web is usually new revolution inside the web science, which usually works upon base of ontologies. Ontologies are receiving great attention in the domain of computing and hence in the domain of security. This review paper examines different proposed “ontology centered techniques” and also provides a comprehensive analysis on these tactics. This research paper gives critical analysis of different models presented by different authors and researchers for ensuring security of a cloud based environment. This analysis helps different vendors of cloud technology to adapt one or all of these models to practically implement in their cloud machines whether they are offering IaaS, PaaS or SaaS. Any new security model using ontologies can also be proposed based on this study, as this paper gives a comprehensive comparison of the previously proposed ontologies for monitoring security state of cloud environment as safe or malicious. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Computing (CC) provides a combination of technologies that allows the user to use the most resources in the least amount of time and with the least amount of money. CC semantics play a critical role in ranking heterogeneous data by using the properties of different cloud services and then achieving the optimal cloud service. Regardless of the efforts made to enable simple access to this CC innovation, in the presence of various organizations delivering comparative services at varying cost and execution levels, it is far more difficult to identify the ideal cloud service based on the user’s requirements. In this research, we propose a Cloud-Services-Ranking Agent (CSRA) for analyzing cloud services using end-users’ feedback, including Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), based on ontology mapping and selecting the optimal service. The proposed CSRA possesses Machine-Learning (ML) techniques for ranking cloud services using parameters such as availability, security, reliability, and cost. Here, the Quality of Web Service (QWS) dataset is used, which has seven major cloud services categories, ranked from 0–6, to extract the required persuasive features through Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg). The classification outcomes through SMOreg are capable and demonstrate a general accuracy of around 98.71% in identifying optimum cloud services through the identified parameters. The main advantage of SMOreg is that the amount of memory required for SMO is linear. The findings show that our improved model in terms of precision outperforms prevailing techniques such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Linear Regression (LR). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction of smart courts promotes the in-deep integration of internet, big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence with judicial trial work, which can both improve trials and ensure judicial justice with more efficiency. High-quality structured legal facts, obtained by extracting information from unstructured legal texts, are the foundation for the construction of smart courts. Based on the strong normative characteristics of Chinese legal text content and structure composition and the strong text feature learning ability of deep learning, this paper proposes an ontology-based and deep learning-driven method for extracting legal facts from Chinese legal texts. The proposed method utilizes rules and patterns generated in the process of knowledge modeling to extract simple entities, and then extracts complex entities hidden in legal text details with deep learning methods. Finally, the extracted entities are mapped into structured legal facts with clear logical relationships by the Chinese Legal Text Ontology. In the information extraction test of judicial datasets composed of Chinese legal texts on theft, the proposed method effectively extracts up to 38 categories of legal facts from legal texts and the number of categories extracted increases significantly. Among them, the rule-based extractor obtains an F1-score of 99.70%, and the deep learning-driven extractor obtains an F1-score of 91.43%. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has great advantages in extracting the completeness and accuracy of legal facts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In autonomous vehicle technology, environmental perception is a very important part of the whole system. The robustness and accuracy of the perception determine the performance of the whole system. Compared with the camera, lidar can generate point cloud data which can provide accurate 3D information better. At present, more researches focus on environmental perception through point cloud. However, the point cloud has the characteristics of sparsity, unordered and non-uniform distribution, its processing method is also different from the general image-based method. In this paper, we proposed a method of semantic segmentation of point cloud which is realized by convolutional neural network. Through spherical mapping, the scattered point cloud is transformed into 2D spherical map with dense and uniform distribution, which is convenient for the processing of the network. To reduce the loss of point information, the spatial position, reflection intensity information and angle value of point are preserved during spherical mapping. Our work includes a lightweight convolutional neural network that fuses point cloud and image information. In addition, a spatial module is added to supplement the loss of spatial information and improve the performance of segmentation. Finally, a series of comparative experiments and performance evaluation are carried out, which show that the proposed method is not only much better than the original structure, but also better than another image and lidar fusion network in the segmentation of each category. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing complexity is growing rapidly with the advancements that it is witnessing. It has created a requirement to simplify the process of configuring cloud and re-configuring it when required, it also involves tasks like auto scaling of infrastructure, elastic computing and maintaining the health of the servers. The proposed method introduces a smart cloud management using knowledge base, which models the resources of cloud; it handles service level agreement and its evaluations. The proposed knowledge base supports representational state transfer (REST/RESTful) services to store and manipulate different cloud aspects like type of application, business configuration, and metrics value and its type; it also implements the strategy for efficient resource management for smart clouds. The proposed architecture consists of smart cloud engine (which provides autonomous services, which help to exploit cloud resources for service optimization and to perform service automation), knowledge base (KB) (provide a cloud ontology which will help in the management of resources and provides intelligence to the smart cloud), server and cloud enrolment, designated monitoring tool and moderator. The resulted module is easy to integrate with any of the existing cloud management tool or orchestrator. As It is developed using REST protocol and extensible markup language (XML) language it is also easy to integrate with existing monitoring tool or application programming interface (APIs). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Searchable encryption provides an effective way for data security and privacy in cloud storage. Users can retrieve encrypted data in the cloud under the premise of protecting their own data security and privacy. However, most of the current content-based retrieval schemes do not contain enough semantic information of the article and cannot fully reflect the semantic information of the text. In this paper, we propose two secure and semantic retrieval schemes based on BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) named SSRB-1, SSRB-2. By training the documents with BERT, the keyword vector is generated to contain more semantic information of the documents, which improves the accuracy of retrieval and makes the retrieval result more consistent with the user’s intention. Finally, through testing on real data sets, it is shown that both of our solutions are feasible and effective. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has emerged as a tremendous opportunity for both industry and academia as it introduces a fundamental shift in Cloud service delivery. This situation has led to more competitive Cloud providers giving end-users greater freedom to choose the best Cloud service. However, each Cloud provider uses its techniques to describe its Cloud services. As a result, it is increasingly difficult for users to find and access Cloud services with similar functionality. The variety of these techniques is due to the lack of Cloud services description standardization. To deal with such issues and due to the vast search space, we propose in this paper a Cloud services description ontology, “CSDO,” that assists the Cloud service publication, discovery, and selection processes. The proposed description is based on the Linked-USDL language to describe Cloud services thanks to its expressiveness. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - While service discovery is an area of active research in which many approaches were proposed, particularly for Web services, this issue still needs to be mature for Cloud computing. Little attention is given to the problem of discovering Cloud services on the Internet, and existing solutions have significant limitations, such as time consumption and poor performance. This paper proposes a semantic-based approach for Cloud cognitive service discovery in Multi-Cloud environments to accurately answer user functional requirements. A set of experiments is carried out to validate the method. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a growing global awareness that harnessing the potential of information and communication technologies (ICTs) can foster innovation, progress, and economic development. Through this process, a transformation takes place that aims at country growth, employment, improved life quality as well as simplification, and greater active democratic citizen participation. In this rapidly evolving scenario, cloud services for Public Administration seem to be one of the most cost-effective means to overcome system limitations, providing those features of effectiveness, efficiency, transparency, participation, sharing, cooperation, interoperability, and security needed for today's challenges. In this research, we present an approach based on distributed systems and ontologies for creating virtual assistants that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to save time and public money by providing better services, increasing effectiveness, efficiency and transparency. We developed a framework to guide cloud consumers in selecting cloud technologies through opportunity and risk analysis to reach this objective. The results demonstrated reduced support costs, improved tracking of provided services, and simplified work for public officials with the goal of re-balancing bargaining power between the small organization and the cloud service provider. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Thanks to the services provided by the major cloud computing providers, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) appears to be inevitable. Information analysis and processing, where the primary purpose is to extract knowledge and recombine it to create new knowledge, is an interesting research topic where AI is commonly applied. This research focuses on the semantic search problem: semantic search refers to the ability of search engines to evaluate the intent and context of search phrases while offering content to users. This study aims to see if introducing two biologically inspired characteristics, “weighting” and “correlated” characters, may increase semantic analysis performance. First, we built a preliminary prototype, ARISE, a semantic search engine using a new Artificial Network architecture built upon a new type of Artificial Neuron. Then, we trained and tested ARISE on the PubMed datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Industry-University-Research collaborative information sharing cloud platform assisting human decentralization algorithm for the cross-border E-commerce is implemented in this paper. The function of the information management module is to take advantage of the large storage capacity of cloud computing, improve storage efficiency, and ensure the smooth progress of information transmission, storage, and backup in the system. With this theoretical basis, this paper then considers the novel decentralization algorithm. The core idea of ontology is to gradually abstract the concepts and relationships of each specific object, and to standardize and standardize the general description of concepts in the field. So that all objects in the domain can recognize and understand the concept of ontology description, so as to realize the sharing of the knowledge information in the ontology domain. Then this framework will be applied into the process of information sharing cloud platform for assisting the implementation of human decentralization algorithm in cross-border E-commerce applications. The performance is validated through testing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Infocommunication technological solutions in healthcare are an environment at the intersection of information technologies, achievements in medical science, the work of medical institutions, insurance companies, doctors and patients. The authors emphasize that in addition to this, there is a clear trend towards personalized medicine, which will be most effective when using cloud technologies. It is noted that medical organizations mainly use information systems that ensure the transfer of financial, operational and personnel applications to the cloud. With the advent of new digital services, there is also an increasing need for cloud transformation of key medical systems and applications to improve the quality of patient care. The article discusses aspects of the implementation of cloud infrastructure solutions in the process of automating various clinical areas. It highlights the need for integrated healthcare solutions including medical imaging and emergency medical care. The possibility of combining applications, servers and databases used by various organizations (health authorities, medical organizations, research centers, etc.) into a common network using modern cloud platform solutions is noted. The aspects of standardization of medical information systems and the use of standard products, including ontologies, are noted. The task of the near future is the development of cloud solutions in the intelligent assistant to the doctor, including the introduction of integrated clinical applications, automatic quality control of medical care and other areas. The possibility of developing universal interfaces for integrated clinical applications is being considered. This is especially important in emergency situations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A trend from centralized to decentralized production is emerging in the manufacturing domain leading to new and innovative approaches for long-established production methods. A technology supporting this trend is Cloud Manufacturing, which adapts technologies and concepts known from cloud computing to the manufacturing domain. A core aspect of Cloud Manufacturing is representing knowledge about manufacturing, e.g., machine capabilities, in a suitable form. This knowledge representation should be flexible and adaptable so that it fits across various manufacturing domains, but, at the same time, should also be specific and exhaustive. We identify three core capabilities that such a platform has to support, i.e., the product, the process and the production. We propose representing this knowledge in semantically specified knowledge graphs, essentially creating three through features interconnected ontologies each representing a facet of manufacturing. Finally, we present an exemplary implementation of a Cloud Manufacturing platform using this representation and its advantages. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Because a large number of images are generated every day and the storage capacity of mobile terminals is limited, people have to upload private images to cloud storage services. Although this choice solves the problem of image storage, it brings another problem: how to protect the privacy of the image owner. At present, although some searchable encryption methods have been proposed, most of them are all based on large-scale calculations, and most of the user's devices do not have the corresponding processing capabilities. Therefore, this paper propose a lightweight model for encrypted image retrieval under cloud computing. This model would solve the problem of limited capabilities of user equipment through image semantic extraction, image semantic tree construction, and separation of feature extraction and encryption processes, while providing users with a feasible image encryption scheme that can be retrieved. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the exponential growth in data generated every year, Big Data has become one of the core research subjects in the overall computing domain. But when considering big data scenarios in a cloud centric environment, the need for a resource management mechanism is of vital importance. Under those circumstances, intelligent allocation of resources can have a direct and noticeable impact on application performance. The aim of this paper is to present a solution on dynamic resource allocation for efficient cloud scalability. This is made possible by using machine learning algorithms as well as user feedback, in order to generate an adequate resource forecasting model. The efficiency of the tool is evaluated by repeatedly executing extensive analysis of various datasets provided by the end users, exploiting the cloud computing paradigm for their analytic purposes. The given solution is able to learn and enhance its knowledge graph considering user feedback, as well as previously executed processes in our cloud environment. To this extent, the forecasting model will attempt to estimate optimal resource allocation for each user scenario. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Edge and cloud computing infrastructures consist of multiple resources that may belong to different providers and are utilized in a shared manner by distributed applications for computing and storage purposes. Detecting events that affect the efficient operation of such infrastructures is a challenge and absolutely necessary for providing high quality cloud-edge services. In this work, we model cloud-edge infrastructures using knowledge graphs and use graph embeddings to transform the graphs into vectors. Then, traditional data-driven machine learning algorithms are used in order to detect anomaly events that relate to the infrastructure usage. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is a new concept that has interesting advantages; high computing performances provided as needed, much lower cost than inhouse infrastructures, and better reliability and scalability. However, with some drawbacks that are impeding its adoption, security is so far the most alarming concern for companies or organizations. Access control policies, for example, are the most challenging issue that has been tackled these last years; to ensure that the right user is accessing the right resources in such a distributed, virtual and scalable environment handled by a third party, to manage an access request to a shared resource from heterogeneous entities following different policies. In this study, the authors aim to overcome this issue by implementing an access control architecture enabling access to the shared data for collaborating organizations. They propose a model supplied with an ontology database describing the whole environment to control access to a publish/subscribe messaging protocol; which capitalizes on the advantages provided by innovative techniques such as Semantic Web technologies and the publish/subscribe protocol. Semantic Web technologies provide dynamism and scalability for this model thanks to its SWRL inference engine while the publish/subscribe protocol, in this case, MQTT, which is a light-coupling protocol simplifies the traffic between the different actors involved. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence of a new class of systems for monitoring and forecasting hazardous processes and natural phenomena, capable of taking into account information received from network users, actualizes the issues related to the collection, processing and transmission of large volumes of heterogeneous and semi-structured data from large geographically distributed territories. At the same time, one of the main problems is the integration and further analysis of such data in order to increase the level of decision-making automation. Ontological models make it possible to systematize and formalize semi-structured data, to obtain knowledge about the domain on their basis. This paper considers the architecture of a system for monitoring and forecasting hazardous natural processes, including an intellectual analysis module. It is proposed to use ontology models to determine the vertices of a cognitive map, on the basis of which further analysis will be carried out and a decision will be made. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to determine the vertices of the cognitive map of the aquatic ecosystem of the Ponto-Caspian region. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to develop domain ontologies that reflect knowledge about the domain of hazardous processes and natural phenomena of the coastal infrastructure of the Ponto-Caspian region, as well as knowledge taking into account information received from network users for a monitoring and forecasting system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid implementation of Cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, health providers are specifically concerned about handling data privacy on the cloud. Existing methods have either scalability issues by requiring that patients grant access to their medical data or a trust issue by having a single authority, thereby creating the problem of a single point of attack. Hence there is a need to develop an EHR system that addresses these bottlenecks for safe, secure, and easy cloud-based EHR management. To address these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that allows policy-based multi-authority access permission to Electronic Health Record systems used by multiple care providers from various places or organizations. This framework, residing on the Edge, has been built using the Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA-ABE) and Semantic Web technologies to provide a safe, semantically rich approach to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations who manage different attributes of end-users using a shared dataset. This paper describes our novel approach and the proof of concept prototype that we created to evaluate our framework. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Using mobile cloud technology, local application resources can move into the cloud computing resource pool in the form of web services. The web services discovery and execution processes in the mobile environment are considered a very difficult challenge. Moreover, these processes may degrade network performance due to the mobile environment. To overcome these issues, we present a new approach for better discovery, selection, execution, and negotiation of OWL-S services by utilizing a multi-agent system in mobile cloud computing. By using the Multi-Agent System (mobile agent and fixed agent), these processes are made with the minimum utilization of resources because the mobile agents migrate to targeted services and interact locally with them. Moreover, the use of mobile agent overcomes the problems related to the mobile environment and wireless devices. Besides, it automatizes the discovery, selection, execution, and negotiation of OWL-S services. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Moreover, we conclude that the mobile agent is a good solution to eliminate the problem of wireless devices and the mobile environment, and reduces the execution time of service discovery and invocation. Also, the finding indicates that cloud computing is a good solution to eliminate the problem of storage and execution in mobile devices. Besides, context-aware provides a more accurate service selection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As one of the emerging cloud computing technologies, containers are widely used in academia and industry. The cloud computing built by the container in the high performance computing (HPC) center can provide high-quality services to users at the edge. Singularity Definition File and Dockerfile (we refer to such files as recipes) have attracted wide attention due to their encapsulation of the application running environment in a container. However, creating a recipe requires extensive domain knowledge, which is error-prone and time-consuming. Accordingly, more than 34% of Dockerfiles in Github cannot successfully build container images. The crucial points about recipe creation include selecting the entities (base images and packages) and determining their relationships (correct installation order for transitive dependencies). Since the relationships between entities can be expressed accurately and efficiently by the knowledge graph, we introduce knowledge graph to generate high-quality recipes automatically. This paper proposes an automatic recipe generation system named Burner, enabling users with no professional computer background to generate the recipes. We first develop a toolset including a recipe parser and an entity-relationship miner. Our two-phase recipe parsing method can perform abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing more deeply on the recipe file to achieve entity extraction; the parsing success rate (PSR) of the two-phase parsing method is 10.1% higher than the one-phase parsing. Then, we build a knowledge base containing 2,832 entities and 62,614 entity relationships, meeting the needs of typical HPC applications. In the test of image build, the singularity image build success rate reaches 80%. Compared with the ItemCF recommendation method, our recommendation method TB-TFIDF achieves a performance improvement by up to 50.86%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The evaluation problem in educational environments has been a constant, even today due to the current contingency generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, education has had to migrate to the virtual environment and the difficulty of evaluation persists. The purpose of this work is present comprehensively the efforts made in the construction of an intelligent system for the customization of evaluation activities implemented in virtual learning environments. The system architecture consists of three modules. In previous works, an architecture of a strategic learning meta-model has been designed that is divided into three layers, the intelligent layer where an ontological model was designed, the infrastructure layer has been designed with a cloud computing solution and the reactive layer that contains the architecture of the regulation model. Each of these layers corresponds to a module of the system. This work presents the results of three stages of experiments and shows a continuous increase in the approval rate trend. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The document vectors constructed by the traditional searchable encryption scheme based on the term frequency-inverse document frequency model not only have high dimensionality and sparsity, but also ignore the semantic information of documents and keywords. In this paper, we introduce the sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model (SBERT) to obtain semantic information-embedded vectors for documents and keywords. By adopting the SBERT model, we pro-pose a CBG-index based semantic-aware multi-keyword ranked search scheme (CSMRS). In the scheme, a topic-term frequency-inverse topic frequency (TTF-ITF) model and a clustering-based group index (CBG-index) are proposed. The TTF-ITF model is used to generate semantic vectors for keywords, and the CBG-index is used to improve the search efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the better performance than the existing works in terms of search efficiency and search result semantic precision. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent incorporation of new Data Mining and Machine Learning services within Cloud Computing providers is empowering users with extremely comprehensive data analysis tools including all the advantages of this type of environment. Providers of Cloud Computing services for Data Mining publish the descriptions and definitions in many formats and often not compatible with other providers. From a functional point of view, having the possibility to describe complete Data Mining services is fundamental to maintain the usability and especially the portability of these services independently of the software/hardware support or even the differences between cloud platforms. The main objective of this article is to design a Data Mining service definition which allows to compose with a single and simple definition a complete service, in such way a data mining workflow can be ported and deployed in different providers or even in a Market Place of this type of ready-to-consume services. This article presents a semantic scheme for the definition and description of complete Data Mining services considering both the management of the service by the provider (price, authentication, Service Level Agreement,...) and the definition of the Data Mining workflow as a service. It represents a solid contribution for paving the way to the standardization and industrialization of Data Mining services. To asses the validity of the scheme a list of services from Data Mining providers have been described and an example of a full service for a Random Forest algorithm has been defined as a service. In addition, a practical scenario has been developed, creating a deployment platform for Data Mining services to give functional support to the scheme, illustrating the practical benefits of the proposal for the end user. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Several approaches have been proposed to describe services in a rich and generic manner (such as WSDL, OWL-S, WSMO, and SAWSDL). However, current approaches remain inappropriate for cloud computing since: 1) they lack in a way or another semantic or business aspect, 2) they cannot fully cope with non-functional properties, 3) they are unable to cover all kinds of services (such as SaaS, PaaS, IaaS). Despite the existence of several attempts which have tried to extent existing studies, the problem remains open. In this paper, we propose Cloud-WSDL, a new description model aligned with WSDL language, the most popular language, to make it more suitable for describing cloud services. The idea is to enhance WSDL description with new functional, non-functional and cloud features so to cope with many aspects (technical, operational, business, semantic and contextual). The proposed extension ensures a high interoperability between services belonging to multiple heterogeneous clouds, and supports all the kinds of cloud services (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS). To do that, we rely on MDA principle to extent WSDL metamodel through several metamodel transformation. The extension process begins by transforming WSDL metamodel into Cloud-WSDL metamodel, thus we obtain a syntactic Cloud-WSDL extension. After that, as a second step, the produced model is transformed into an OWL-S ontology to offer a semantic Cloud-WSDL extension. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In modern distribution grids, the access to the growing amount of data from various sources, the execution of complex algorithms on-demand, and the control of sparse actuators require on-demand scalability to support fluctuating workloads. Cloud computing technologies represent a viable solution for these requirements. To ensure that data can be exchanged and shared efficiently, as well as the full achievement of the cloud computing benefits to support the advanced analytic and mining required in smart grids, applications can be empowered with semantic information integration. This article adopts the semantic web into a cloud-based platform to analyze power distribution grids data and apply a service restoration application to re-energize loads after an electrical fault. The exemplary implementation of the demo is powered by FIWARE, which is based on open-source and customizable building blocks for future internet applications and services, and the SARGON ontology for the energy domain. The tests are deployed by integrating the semantic information, based on the IEC 61850 data model, in the cloud-based service restoration application and interfacing the field devices of the distribution grids. The platform performances, measured as network latency and computation time, ensure the feasibility of the proposed solution, constituting a reference for the next deployments of smart energy platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, providing security for the data is the major concern especially in the cloud storage unit. Therefore, a security aware mechanism has to be developed to improve the security using ontology concepts in the cloud storage most of the existing servers used in the networks are used for storing and accessing the data, but these servers are built in a centralized manner, providing security for the data is a key requirement for the servers. The major threat in the existing servers is the data stored in the servers are subjected to hacking. This paper presents a technique to efficiently store the data in cloud by using concepts of ontology and Secret Sharing Scheme (SSS) has been introduced in the proposed framework to protect the data. This paper presents a model whereby the data can be securely stored for the longer duration in the distributed environments. Ultimately the proposed security scheme has achieved better performance and outperformed the conventional technique. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Resource description framework (RDF) inherently supports data mergers from various resources into a single federated graph that can become very large even for an application of modest size. This results in severe performance degradation in the execution of RDF queries. As every RDF query essentially traverses a graph to find the output of the query, an efficient path traversal reduces the execution time of RDF queries. Hence, query path optimization is required to reduce the execution time as well as the cost of a query. Query path optimization is an NP-hard problem that cannot be solved in polynomial time. Genetic algorithms have proven to be very useful in optimization problems. The authors propose a hybrid genetic algorithm for query path optimization. The proposed algorithm selects an initial population using iterative improvement, thus reducing the initial solution space for the genetic algorithm. The proposed algorithm makes significant improvements in the overall performance. They show that the overall number of joins for complex queries is reduced considerably, resulting in reduced cost. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To meet user's functional requirements, cloud computing and big data have become the most commonly used computing and data resources. Based on analysis, conversion, extraction and refinement for the big data, a disease can be prevented and group behavior can be predicted. However, each user's private data is also an element in big data. Users must provide private data to the service providers to meet their functional requirements. To gain economic benefits, some SaaS service providers have not been authorized to collect and analyze the user's sensitive private data, as a result, the user's private data is disclosed. In this paper, we propose a private data chain disclosure discovery method, to prevent a user's sensitive privacy information from being illegally disclosed. First, we measure the similarity degree and cost of the disclosure of the private data. Second, according to the similarity degree and cost of disclosure, the disclosure chain and key private data are detected in the process of interaction between user and SaaS service. Third, we propose a discovery framework for the private data chain and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness by experiments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid growth in biological sequence data is revolutionizing our understanding of genotypic diversity and challenging conventional approaches to informatics. With the increasing availability of genomic data, traditional bioinformatic tools require substantial computational time and the creation of ever-larger indices each time a researcher seeks to gain insight from the data. To address these challenges, we pre-computed important relationships between biological entities spanning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and captured this information in a relational database. The database can be queried across hundreds of millions of entities and returns results in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. In this paper, we describe Functional Genomics Platform (formerly known as OMXWare), a comprehensive database relating genotype to phenotype for bacterial life. Continually updated, the Functional Genomics Platform today contains data derived from 200,000 curated, self-consistently assembled genomes. The database stores functional data for over 68 million genes, 52 million proteins, and 239 million domains with associated biological activity annotations from Gene Ontology, KEGG, MetaCyc, and Reactome. The Functional Genomics Platform maps all of the many-To-many connections between each biological entity including the originating genome, gene, protein, and protein domain. Various microbial studies, from infectious disease to environmental health, can benefit from the rich data and connections. We describe the data selection, the pipeline to create and update the Functional Genomics Platform, and the developer tools (Python SDK and REST APIs)which allow researchers to efficiently study microbial life at scale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Web services are products in the era of service-oriented computing and cloud computing. Considering the information overload problem arising from the task of selecting web services, a recommendation system is by far the most effective solution for performing such selections. However, users calling a limited number of services will cause severe data sparseness and a weak correlation with services. In addition, fully mining the semantic features and knowledge features of the text description is also a major problem that needs to be solved urgently. This paper proposes a deep knowledge-aware approach which introduces knowledge graph and knowledge representation into web service recommendation for the first time. We solve the data sparse problem and optimize the user’s feature representation. In this approach, an attention module is introduced to model the impact of tags for the candidate services on different words of user queries, and a deep neural network is used to model the high-level features of user-service invocation behaviors. The results of experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve better recommendation performance than other state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, considerable efforts have been made by cultural heritage institutions across the globe to digitise cultural heritage sites, artifacts, historical maps, etc. for digital preservation and online representation. On the other hand, ample research projects and studies have been published that demonstrate the great capabilities of web-geographic information systems (web-GIS) for the dissemination and online representation of cultural heritage data. However, cultural heritage data and the associated metadata produced by many cultural heritage institutions are hetero-geneous. To make this heterogeneous data more interoperable and structured, an ever-growing number of cultural heritage institutions are adopting linked data principles. Although the cultural heritage domain has already started implementing linked open data concepts to the cultural heritage data, there are not many research articles that present an easy-to-implement, free, and open-source-based web-GIS architecture that integrates 3D digital cultural heritage models with cloud computing and linked open data. Furthermore, the integration of web-GIS technologies with 3D web-based visualisation and linked open data may offer new dimensions of interaction and exploration of digital cultural heritage. To demonstrate the high potential of integration of these technol-ogies, this study presents a novel cloud architecture that attempts to enhance digital cultural heritage exploration by integrating 3D digital cultural heritage models with linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms using web-GIS technologies. More specifically, a digital interactive map, 3D digital cultural heritage models, and linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms were integrated into a cloud-based web-GIS architecture. Thus, the users of the architecture can easily interact with the digital map, visualise 3D digital cultural heritage models, and ex-plore linked open data from GeoNames and DBpedia platforms, which offer additional information and context related to the selected cultural heritage site as well as external web resources. The architecture was validated by applying it to specific case studies of Australian cultural heritage and seeking expert feedback on the system, its benefits, and scope for improvement in the near future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this letter, we propose a novel smart livestock surveillance system through cooperation of AIoT (artificial intelligence of things) devices and the cloud computing platform, aiming at providing semantic information via assembling deep networks with AIoT devices of limited resource. The key of the proposed system includes two designs: Deep-net assembling as a semantic surveillance service and the expandable-convolutional-block neural network (ECB-Net). The first is a development architecture of the divide-and-conquer philosophy for establishing semantic surveillance systems, and this work provides a concrete instance for promoting deep-net assembling to livestock industries. The second is an AIoT device-friendly neural network for filtering insignificant camera images to achieve high robustness of smart surveillance systems. The technical details from the architecture design to optimal ECB-Net model creation are presented in related sections. Finally, we develop the prototype of the smart livestock surveillance system and deploy it by swine rooms for conducting real-world integrated tests. Testing results reveal the superior performance of our proposed smart livestock surveillance scheme. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The multi-dimensional characteristics of public opinion in online education lead to the difficulty of data cross-dimensional mining. To solve this problem, this paper designs a cross-dimensional data mining model of public opinion in online education based on fuzzy association rules. Based on the public opinion subject, object, and ontology to analyze the characteristics of public opinion in online education, Yaahp software is used to calculate the influence factor weight of public opinion in online education. According to the weight analysis results, the relationship between the dimensions of various public opinion data is clarified by using data semantic association. This paper introduces the fuzzy set theory into the database and uses crawlers to obtain public opinion data and stores them in the database, to complete the data preprocessing through distributed text preprocessing, feature selection distributed computing, and text vectorization distributed computing. Taking the cloud computing platform as the core, the cross-dimension mining model of public opinion in online education data is constructed according to the dimension correlation analysis and preprocessing results. The simulation results show that the model has the advantages of wide range, fast speed, and high accuracy, and can provide data support for education reform. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To ensure a secure Cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, we need to encrypt data and impose field-level access control to prevent malicious usage. Since the attributes of the Users will change with time, the encryption policies adopted may also vary. For large EHR systems, it is often necessary to search through the encrypted data in realtime and perform client-side computations without decrypting all patient records. This paper describes our novel cloud-based EHR system that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) combined with Semantic Web technologies to facilitate differential access to an EHR, thereby ensuring only Users with valid attributes can access a particular field of the EHR. The system also includes searchable encryption using keyword index and search trapdoor, which allows querying EHR fields without decrypting the entire patient record. The attribute revocation feature is efficiently managed in our EHR by delegating the revision of the secret key and ciphertext to the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). Our methodology incorporates advanced security features that eliminate malicious use of EHR data and contributes significantly towards ensuring secure digital health systems on the Cloud. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the last decades, web services are used for performing specific tasks demanded by users. The most important task of service’s classification system is to match an anonymous input service with the stored pre-classified web services. The most challenging issue is that web services are currently organized and classified according to syntax while the context of the requested service is ignored. Due to this motivation, Cloud-based Classification Methodology is proposed as it presents a new methodology based on semantic web service’s classification. Furthermore, cloud computing is used for not only storing but also allocating the high scale of web services with both high availability and accessibility. Fog technology is employed to reduce the latency and to speed up response time. The experimental results using the suggested methodology show a better performance of the proposed system regarding both precision and accuracy in comparison with most of the methods discussed in the literature of the current study. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective genetic diagnosis requires the correlation of genetic variant data with detailed phenotypic information. However, manual encoding of clinical data into machine-readable forms is laborious and subject to observer bias. Natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records has great potential to enhance reproducibility at scale but suffers from idiosyncrasies in physician notes and other medical records. We developed methods to optimize NLP outputs for automated diagnosis. We filtered NLP-extracted Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to more closely resemble manually extracted terms and identified filter parameters across a three-dimensional space for optimal gene prioritization. We then developed a tiered pipeline that reduces manual effort by prioritizing smaller subsets of genes to consider for genetic diagnosis. Our filtering pipeline enabled NLP-based extraction of HPO terms to serve as a sufficient replacement for manual extraction in 92% of prospectively evaluated cases. In 75% of cases, the correct causal gene was ranked higher with our applied filters than without any filters. We describe a framework that can maximize the utility of NLP-based phenotype extraction for gene prioritization and diagnosis. The framework is implemented within a cloud-based modular architecture that can be deployed across health and research institutions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The variety of cloud services (CSs) that are described, their non-uniform naming conventions, and their heterogeneous types and features make cloud service discovery a difficult problem. Therefore, an intelligent cloud service discovery framework (CSDF) is needed for discovering the appropriate services that meet the user’s requirements. This study proposes a CSDF for extracting cloud service attributes (CSAs) based on classification, ontology, and agents. Multiple-phase classification with topic modeling has been implemented using different machine learning techniques to increase the efficiency of CSA extraction. CSAs that are represented in different formats have been extracted and represented in a comprehensive ontology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the framework. The experimental results showed that the multiple-phase classification methods with topic modeling for CSs using a support vector machine (SVM) obtained a high accuracy (87.90%) compared to other methods. In addition, the results of extracting CSAs showed high values for precision, recall, and f-measure of 99.24%, 99.24%, and 99.24%, respectively, for Java script object notation(JSON) format, followed by 99.05%, 97.20%, and 98.11% for table formats, and with lower accuracy for text format (90.63%, 86.57%, and 88.55%). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the recent trends, cloud computing service users agreed on the concept of pay and use model by accessing all the best services provided by the providers. The major problem here is that there is no standardization so that not everyone coming into the same platform. Now cloud computing efficiently uses time, cost, and effort. In this internet, speed is playing an important role. With the development of each and every field with its proper limitations, the researchers come into the picture that the ontology concept is playing a vital role in the field of computing. The key role of ontology is supporting the knowledge sharing activities. It is giving the set of criteria to prove the use of ontology in the computing world. In the design and development of ontology for computing and mathematics, the information from data centers is very important. The selected design and decisions give efficient and effective results to prove how ontology is playing a vital role in the computing system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As different cloud computing services have emerged over the years, the diversity of technologies and the lack of standardization has given rise to an interoperability problem in cloud computing. Cloud computing services include those such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Data as a Service (DaaS). In this context, interoperability enables a service to communicate with another service transparently. Among the solutions proposed in the literature, a middleware can be used to intermediate such communication and to mitigate the lack of interoperability in cloud computing. For instance, the middleware MIDAS (Middleware for DaaS and SaaS) provides transparent interoperability between SaaS and DaaS. Although MIDAS current version promotes syntactic interoperability, semantic interoperability is only superficially addressed. In collaboration with this project, we develop an OWL-based ontology to formally represent the communication between SaaS and DaaS, and discuss its strengths in providing semantic interoperability on MIDAS. We conduct a set of experiments to validate our ontology. We evaluate intrinsic (consistency, correctness, acceptance) and extrinsic (integration between ontology and MIDAS) issues. Results provide evidence that a semantic MIDAS interoperability can be enhanced by our ontology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Caregivers of people with dementia find it extremely difficult to choose the best care method because of complex environments and the variable symptoms of dementia. To alleviate this care burden, interventions have been proposed that use computer- or web-based applications. For example, an automatic diagnosis of the condition can improve the well-being of both the person with dementia and the caregiver. Other interventions support the individual with dementia in living independently. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop an ontology-based care knowledge management system for people with dementia that will provide caregivers with a care guide suited to the environment and to the individual patient's symptoms. This should also enable knowledge sharing among caregivers. Methods: To build the care knowledge model, we reviewed existing ontologies that contain concepts and knowledge descriptions relating to the care of those with dementia, and we considered dementia care manuals. The basic concepts of the care ontology were confirmed by experts in Korea. To infer the different care methods required for the individual dementia patient, the reasoning rules as defined in Semantic Web Rule Languages and Prolog were utilized. The accuracy of the care knowledge in the ontological model and the usability of the proposed system were evaluated by using the Pellet reasoner and OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!, and a survey and interviews were conducted with caregivers working in care centers in Korea. Results: The care knowledge model contains six top-level concepts: care knowledge, task, assessment, person, environment, and medical knowledge. Based on this ontological model of dementia care, caregivers at a dementia care facility in Korea were able to access the care knowledge easily through a graphical user interface. The evaluation by the care experts showed that the system contained accurate care knowledge and a level of assessment comparable to normal assessment tools. Conclusions: In this study, we developed a care knowledge system that can provide caregivers with care guides suited to individuals with dementia. We anticipate that the system could reduce the workload of caregivers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper proposes a semantic retrieval model for mobile learning resources based on ontology. The model includes three modules: word segmentation of retrieval information, semantic expansion, and semantic retrieval. We describe the agent as an object node in the category theory, the interaction and dependency between the agents as a morphism, and the entire cloud service system as a type category graph. The case study shows that the framework cannot only support the modeling and analysis of the service system at the abstract level, but also support the service composition by mapping the abstract model to the realization technology, which can analyze the correctness of the requirement decomposition and service composition well. It can be used to guide the description and construction of the service system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The most classic method of constructing knowledge graph is the Translate-based TransE model, which uses Euclidean distance as the measure in the score function. Each feature dimension participates in the calculation with the same weight, and its accuracy is limited when dealing with complex relations. Aiming at the defects of traditional models, a knowledge graph construction model, TransCD, based on cloud model for multi-semantic relationship is proposed to adapt to the construction of domain knowledge graph in power industry. By dividing the relationship into multiple semantics, the Gaussian mixture model of the relationship is constructed; The corresponding cloud model is constructed to obtain the linguistic value and certainty that can best express the relationship; The determinacy is taken as the weight and the weighted Euclidean distance is taken as the new score function. At the same time, combined with the TransD method, the space projection model of entities and relations is established through dynamic mapping matrix, which integrates the advantages of the two models and increases the ability of the model to deal with multiple semantic relations. The experimental results show that the new method is superior to Trans(E, H, R, D) in terms of link prediction and ternary classification tasks, and has advantages in the processing of multi-semantic professional knowledge in the power industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Learners have different learning styles each tailored to their own personality. Incompatibility of learning and teaching style is inconvenient. This paper integrates learner behavior modeling, academic web crawling and content retrieval using state of the art technology. This research work aims to propose a personalized ubiquitous learning model to identify learner learning styles and deploy type of content that is corresponding to the learner's learning style. Felder-Solomon model is one of the models being used for the learner profiling. This gives ease not only to the learners but the pedagogical instructors as well for not making different type of content. Real time monitoring makes the self-adaptive system learn through the learner's gestures and self-adjusts autonomously. Learners' aptitude increases, saving time and inconvenience. This will give an easy access to certifying organizations to get more capable skill oriented people. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A Cloud Computing system is a complex system. The existing metric systems are inadequate for providing a high-fidelity picture of what is going on in the complex cloud and do not facilitate all the assessments needed by businesses. Therefore, we have proposed a novel model for cloud service measurement resulting in implementation of an ontology of cloud computing metrics (“web of metrics”). It provides an armada of measures, including the existing metrics and those which are novel in the cloud service analytics literature. Its novelty partially stems from the fields such as business management, and also emerges as a result of recognizing service client, service provider and service regulator analytics requirements. Thirty-five metric attributes for each of the several hundred metrics have been distinguished. The ontology and the measurements can be made consumable for businesses through Business Intelligence and data science software, and customized dashboards can be produced for case, as the metric ontology is multi-faceted and is customised given the use-case at hand in order to gain business advantage. A detailed practical example regarding the development of an Elasticity trust mark for the benefit of cloud users, cloud service providers and the regulators has been provided. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

MCC faces several security threats in both the Cloud and Mobile environments. Among several threats, malicious apps are the most threatening ones, because they can perform various malicious activities in both environments. The traditional malware detection methods may not detect new types of malware or rapidly changing malware behavior. So, there is a need to develop an accurate model for detecting malicious apps in the MCC environment. Scalability and Knowledge Reusability are challenging issues in existing detection methods. To overcome these issues, the proposed model uses an effective Ontology-based intelligent model based on app permissions to detect malware apps. This model extracts the relationship between the static features from the apps and builds an Apps Feature Ontology (AFO). A concept vector set for apps is created using the items obtained from the AFO. The most discriminant features are selected using optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization, Social Spider Algorithm (SSA), and Gravitational Search Algorithm to reduce the dimension of the concept vector set. Various classifiers are applied to the reduced set. The efficiency of the proposed approach was evaluated on datasets obtained from the AndroZoo repository and VirusShare. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model can correctly detect malware using the Random Forest (RF) classifier with SSA and achieve higher detection accuracy with the lesser fall-out and less detection speed than existing Android malware detection techniques. Specifically, RF with SSA obtained higher accuracy, F1-score, and reduction in the fall-out of 94.11%, 93%, and 3%, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In PaaS model, providers have different proprietary APIs, which make developers locked inside a specific platform and not able to easily port their applications among different platforms. So, vendor lock-in problem appeared. One solution to this problem is to use generic APIs with specific adapters. However, any update in a PaaS specific-API makes its corresponding adapter is unusable which causes, what we call, API synchronization problem. Therefore, STAGER (SemanTic-based GenERation of Generic-API Adapters) framework is proposed. STAGER framework provides a semi-automatic adapter generation process, which generates specific adapters of generic APIs for PaaS services (e.g., blob storage and datastore services) for target PaaS platforms. The adapter generation process is based on semantic annotations of the generic APIs and their corresponding PaaS specific-APIs. In order to evaluate STAGER framework, two generic APIs for blob storage and NoSQL datastore services have been proposed. STAGER framework is used to generate the adapters of these generic APIs for two PaaS platforms: Google App Engine (GAE) and Windows Azure. Although there is some overhead for semantically annotating the PaaS APIs, the evaluation results prove the feasibility of STAGER framework and promote the usage of the generated adapters for implementing portable cloud applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Keyword search over encrypted data is essential for accessing outsourced sensitive data in cloud computing. In some circumstances, the keywords that the user searches on are only semantically related to the data rather than via an exact or fuzzy match. Hence, semantic-based keyword search over encrypted cloud data becomes of paramount importance. However, existing schemes usually depend upon a global dictionary, which not only affects the accuracy of search results but also causes inefficiency in data updating. Additionally, although compound keyword search is common in practice, the existing approaches only process them as single words, which split the original semantics and achieve low accuracy. To address these limitations, we initially propose a compound concept semantic similarity (CCSS) calculation method to measure the semantic similarity between compound concepts. Next, by integrating CCSS with Locality-Sensitive Hashing function and the secure $k$k-Nearest Neighbor scheme, a semantic-based compound keyword search (SCKS) scheme is proposed. SCKS achieves not only semantic-based search but also multi-keyword search and ranked keyword search. Additionally, SCKS also eliminates the predefined global library and can efficiently support data update. The experimental results on real-world dataset indicate that SCKS introduces low overhead on computation and the search accuracy outperforms the existing schemes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the KG (Knowledge graph), as a new generation of knowledge engineering technical representatives, has been developed vigorously. KG is a key step for artificial intelligence to move towards intelligence. Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is a key technology in the construction of KG. The aim is to complement the missing knowledge in the KG. With the development of the Internet, the scale of data increases exponentially, and the scale of KG is increasing day by day. It is very inefficient to make up the missing knowledge based on manual, so many algorithms of KGC have emerged. In this paper, some typical KGC algorithms based on representation learning are summarized and combed, which are mainly divided into tensor decomposition, neural network and translation transformation. The development direction and prospect of KGC in KG are discussed and prospected. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In large distributed management information system, user operation logs are often implicit but cannot directly reflect the business semantics of user operations. In order to meet the needs of operation and maintenance personnel to carry out work such as security detection and exception analysis based on the business significance, this paper designs a business semantic restoration method for log URL access sequences based on fasttext algorithm. In our method, the original log data is processed to form a structured sequential log record with users as the unit. The log records of one single user will be mapped into a URL access sequence, and this sequence is divided into several business text segments which are composed of URLs and are associated with context semantics. Finally, through the supervised text classification algorithm fasttext, we will get a model that can recognize the business attributes of the text segment of the user URL sequence, in other words, realize the business semantic restoration of the user operation log sequence, which provides data support for the system operation and maintenance personnel. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the development of digital technologies such as cloud computing, big data, and 5G, omni-channel retailing has become the direction of the retail industry reform. To understand the research context, hot spots, and future development trend of global omni-channel retailing in the past decade and provide a reference for relevant research, this paper collects relevant articles in the WOS database from 2011 to 2020, uses the co-word analysis method to make statistics and analysis on keywords, and uses Bicomb, Spss and Excel software to conduct cluster analysis and strategic coordinate analysis on omni-channel retailing research. The results show that the research on omni-channel retailing logistics and supply chain, the research on omni-channel integration and management, and the research on omni-channel digital marketing and consumer behavior are the three hot areas of omni-channel retailing research. In the future, the mixed methods combining quantitative researches (such as machine learning, artificial neural network, and quantitative model) with qualitative research (such as case research and interviews) can be used from a mixed perspective of consumers and retailers to conduct in-depth research on the operation mechanism and the decision-making mechanism of omni-channel retailing and the interdisciplinary research combining omni-channel and organizational management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huashi Baidu Formula (HSBDF) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula consisting of fourteen parts, which has been proven effective for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinically. However, the therapeutic mechanism of the effect of HSBDF on COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: The components and action targets of HSBDF were searched in the TCMSP, YaTCM, PubChem, and TargetNet databases. Disease targets related to ACE2 were screened in single-cell sequence data of colon epithelial cells from other reports. The therapeutic targets of HSBDF for COVID-19 were obtained by integrated analysis, and the protein-protein interaction was analyzed using the STRING database. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) processes were analyzed using the OmicsBean and Metascape databases. The communication between networks [component-target (C-T) network, component-target-pathway (C-T-P) network, herb-target (H-T) network, target-pathway (T-P) network, and meridian-tropism (M-T) network] was constructed by Cytoscape software. The Cloud computing molecular docking platform was used to verify the molecular docking. RESULTS: The obtained 223 active ingredients and 358 targets of HSBDF. The 5,555 COVID-19 disease targets related to ACE2 were extracted, and 84 compound-disease common targets were found, of which the principal targets included ACE, ESR1, ADRA1A, and HDAC1. A total of 3,946 items were seized by GO enrichment analysis, mainly related to metabolism, protein binding, cellular response to the stimulus, and receptor activity. The enriched KEGG pathways screened 46 signaling pathways, including the renin-angiotensin system, the renin secretion, NF-kappa B pathway, the arachidonic acid metabolism, and the AMPK signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the bioactive components of HSBDF have an excellent binding ability with main proteins related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: HSBDF might act on SARS-CoV-2 through multiple components, targets, and pathways. Here we reveal preliminary results of the mechanism of action of HSBDF on SARS-CoV-2, providing a theoretical basis for future clinical applications.

AB  - Ultra Dense Networks with flexible heterogeneous technologies (HetUDN) for the Radio Access Network (RAN) are prospective candidate architectures that promise to bring the required network flexibility and to support the transition to 5G networks. In the same time, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a recent paradigm shift that pushes the main focal point of mobile systems from centralized Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) towards the network edge. Network softwarization enables the operation of new computational elements such as base stations and access points at the MEC, whereas edge computing, network control and storage promise to enable computation-intensive and latency-critical applications for resource constrained mobile devices. In this paper, we employ a novel disaggregated 5G architecture and apply a semantic-based coordination approach from the network edge. We consider semantics as the key enabling principle for the implementation of spectrum coordination schemes addressing the coexistence of heterogeneous technologies at the edge of 5G HetUDN wireless networks. A Semantic-based Framework for dynamic Spectrum Coordination (SFSC) deployed according to the MEC approach is proposed dealing with agile complex system resource management. Practical experimental evidence evaluated on a networking testbed is provided, proving that a semantic MEC middleware is capable of delivering novel advanced computation communication paradigms as needed for 5G networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomedical platforms provide the hardware and software to securely ingest, process, validate, curate, store, and share data. Many large-scale biomedical platforms use secure cloud computing technology for analyzing, integrating, and storing phenotypic, clinical, and genomic data. Several web-based platforms are available for researchers to access services and tools for biomedical research. The use of bio-containers can facilitate the integration of bioinformatics software with various data analysis pipelines. Adoption of Common Data Models, Common Data Elements, and Ontologies can increase the likelihood of data reuse. Managing biomedical Big Data will require the development of strategies that can efficiently leverage public cloud computing resources. The use of the research community developed standards for data collection can foster the development of machine learning methods for data processing and analysis. Increasingly platforms will need to support the integration of data from multiple disease area research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges in building sustainable smart cities of the future is skill management and development. Developing the digital skills of the municipalities’ workforce is crucial for all occupational profiles and specifically for those that are actively involved in the development and operation of digital services for a smart city. In this context, the current paper presents a semantically enhanced cloud-based IT approach which integrates learning pathways with competence management of personnel working as management and technical employees in a smart city municipality. The proposed approach combines a rule-based expert system with a semantically rich infrastructure in order to map skill gap diagnosis to required learning objects and, thus, to contribute in developing appropriate competences of smart city professionals. The semantic infrastructure of the learning platform consists of an ontology which encapsulates the appropriate knowledge and a rule-base for modeling the steps of an employee training process. In order to achieve efficiency in competence management the semantic model has been transformed into a relational database schema, which is further utilized by the system for the execution of useful queries. The paper presents the key modeling artifacts of the proposed approach and the architecture of the implemented CMUTE system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Efficient power data access can not only ensure the normal operation of power system, but also be one of the key supporting technologies to improve the operational efficiency of power grid enterprises. Aiming at the problem that traditional B+ tree does not take into account the relevance of power information fragments and cannot be indexed flexibly, a hybrid index structure and index method of power big data with knowledge graph is proposed, that is, the first layer uses B+ tree structure to store attributes, and the second layer uses knowledge graph to store attribute value, thus realizing the relevance index of power data. The simulation results show that the hybrid index structure can achieve the index of power big data with relevance information without affecting the index efficiency, which provides technical reference for efficient retrieval of multi-modal data in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Safety is the most important aspect of railway transportation. To ensure the safety of high-speed trains, various train components are equipped with sensor devices for real-time moni-toring. Sensor monitoring data can be used for fast intelligent diagnosis and accurate positioning of train faults. However, existing train fault diagnosis technology based on cloud computing has disadvantages of long processing times and high consumption of computing resources, which conflict with the real-time response requirements of fault diagnosis. Aiming at the problems of train fault diagnosis in the cloud environment, this paper proposes a train fault diagnosis model based on edge and cloud collaboration. The model first utilizes a SAES-DNN (stacked auto-encoders deep neural network) fault recognition method, which can integrate automatic feature extraction and type recognition and complete fault classification over deep hidden features in high-dimensional data, so as to quickly locate faults. Next, to adapt to the characteristics of edge computing, the model applies a SAES-DNN model trained in the cloud and deployed in the edge via the transfer learning strategy and carries out real-time fault diagnosis on the vehicle sensor monitoring data. Using a motor fault as an example, when compared with a similar intelligent learning model, the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis model can greatly improve diagnosis accuracy and significantly reduce training time. Through the transfer learning approach, adaptability of the fault diagnosis algorithm for personalized applications and real-time performance of the fault diagnosis is enhanced. This paper also proposes a visual analysis method of train fault data based on knowledge graphs, which can effectively analyze fault causes and fault correlation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Semantic web and cloud technology systems have been critical components in creating and deploying applications in various fields. Although they are self-contained, they can be combined in various ways to create solutions, which has recently been discussed in depth. We have shown a dramatic increase in new cloud providers, applications, facilities, management systems, data, and so on in recent years, reaching a level of complexity that indicates the need for new technology to address such tremendous, shared, and heterogeneous services and resources. As a result, issues with portability, interoperability, security, selection, negotiation, discovery, and definition of cloud services and resources may arise. Semantic Technologies, which has enormous potential for cloud computing, is a vital way of re-examining these issues. This paper explores and examines the role of Semantic-Web Technology in the Cloud from a variety of sources. In addition, a "cloud-driven" mode of interaction illustrates how we can construct the semantic web and provide automated semantical annotations to web applications on a large scale by leveraging Cloud computing properties and advantages. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Big services have recently emerged from the synergy between big data and cloud computing paradigms. This new big data-centric service model aims to provide customer-oriented massive services by combining both physical and virtualized resources from different domains. Although such complex ecosystem is able to process, encapsulate and offer huge volumes of data as services, its management operations are beyond the ability of human administrators, due to several challenges including the big services' large-scale nature and complexity, the heterogeneity of their components (e.g., services, data sources, connected things), the dynamicity and uncertainty of their hosting cloud environments. To cope with the lack of understanding regarding big services capabilities, we propose to describe them using a novel meta-model for the quality of big services (QoBS). We also take advantage of a recent technology called knowledge graphs, to represent the big service information (service descriptions, services' and data sources' quality levels, management policies) as a heterogeneous information network. Finally, a multi-view representation learning approach is proposed to infer additional knowledge regarding big services capabilities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents an ontology-based broker system for the interoperability of federated clouds. The system can provision cloud infrastructure resources from different platforms to meet the users’ requirements of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The system engaged an ontology to enable the interoperability of heterogeneous IaaS management platforms, OpenStack, Apache CloudStack and VMware ESXi. The system provisioned appropriate cloud-infrastructure resources from available platforms based on a vector-space algorithm. Evaluation results relying on the two data sets of non-scheduled and scheduled IaaS-user requests show that our system is practical in that average latencies to generate REST commands for virtual machine provisioning take less than a second per request and are linearly proportional to the number of provisioned servers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The main focus of the work is to propose a semantic intelligent based framework for information processing. Value, Association and the Context are the three main attributes of any information while being transacted over different social networks to opt for an intelligent decision at that instance of time. The information or data as a service in a public cloud environment like social networks is to be processed in order to make it suitable for the future application development. The capacity for users to reuse their data across interoperable applications is known as data portability. It also refers to the user's ability to control their identity, media, and other forms of personal data. Here, we present a formal technique for securely and reliably accessing social networks, as well as explain many problems encountered along the way to facilitate data portability and take advantage of Semantic Web Technologies. We also discussed about several form of heterogeneity between ontologies and how to match them using approaches like string, linguistic, and structural similarities, as well as aggregation using rough sets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Medical organizations find it challenging to adopt cloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) services due to the risk of data breaches and the resulting compromise of patient data. Existing authorization models follow a patient-centric approach for EHR management, where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients' end. This creates significant overhead for the patient, who must authorize every access of their health record. It is also not practical given that multiple personnel are typically involved in providing care and that the patient may not always be in a state to provide this authorization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Garbage classification is a social issue related to people's livelihood and sustainable development, so letting service robots autonomously perform intelligent garbage classification has important research significance. Aiming at the problems of complex systems with data source and cloud service center data transmission delay and untimely response, at the same time, in order to realize the perception, storage, and analysis of massive multisource heterogeneous data, a garbage detection and classification method based on visual scene understanding is proposed. This method uses knowledge graphs to store and model items in the scene in the form of images, videos, texts, and other multimodal forms. The ESA attention mechanism is added to the backbone network part of the YOLOv5 network, aiming to improve the feature extraction ability of the network, combining with the built multimodal knowledge graph to form the YOLOv5-Attention-KG model, and deploying it to the service robot to perform real-Time perception on the items in the scene. Finally, collaborative training is carried out on the cloud server side and deployed to the edge device side to reason and analyze the data in real time. The test results show that, compared with the original YOLOv5 model, the detection and classification accuracy of the proposed model is higher, and the real-Time performance can also meet the actual use requirements. The model proposed in this paper can realize the intelligent decision-making of garbage classification for big data in the scene in a complex system and has certain conditions for promotion and landing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper deals with a problem of workload relocation in a heterogeneous group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) during the area monitoring under the changing environmental conditions. One of the stages of a monitoring problem solving, involving a UAVs distribution by the scan bands, is described. It was noted that, when this stage is being performed, there is not a possibility to take into account any factors of environment. However, it is important because of on-board energy resources limitations. This fact jeopardizes the fulfillment of the entire mission of the group. To avoid this situation, it was proposed to use a decision-making technique, based on ontological analysis, on the need to relocate the workload in a group of mobile robots. It is shown that with an increase in the number of environmental conditions changes, the time of using extra computing resources decreases, which leads to the need to engage more of them to perform the task. A comparative assessment of the amount of resources involved in the implementation of two analogous methods for solving the problem of workload relocation depending on the frequency of changes in environmental conditions is carried out. The results of experiments have shown that the effectiveness of using the ontology-based method in a dynamic environment is higher than the local device group (LDG) method. This allows to increase the time of joint mission execution by a group of robots. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Several approaches have been proposed to describe services in a rich and generic manner (such as WSDL, OWL-S, WSMO, and SAWSDL). However, current approaches remain inappropriate for cloud computing since: 1) they lack in a way or another semantic or business aspect, 2) they cannot fully cope with non-functional properties and cloud characteristics, 3) they are unable to cover all kinds of services (such as SaaS, PaaS, IaaS). Despite the existence of several attempts which have tried to extent existing studies, the problem remains open. In this paper, we propose Cloud-WSDL, a new description model aligned with WSDL language, the most popular language, to make it more suitable for describing cloud services. The idea is to enhance WSDL description with our ontological Generic Cloud Service Description called GCSD to cope with many aspects (technical, operational, business, semantic and contextual) to ensure a high interoperability between services belonging to multiple heterogeneous clouds, and to support all the kinds of cloud services (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing interest in the knowledge graph has attracted a great attention from both academia and the industry. Blockchain-based knowledge construction is deemed to be an alternative by adopting smart contract. However, the complexity of blockchain technology is an obstacle to apply blockchain solutions in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) approach to address the complexity issue. Through our BaaS system, developers can focus on knowledge graph constructions instead of struggling for mastering blockchain technology. We have implemented our BaaS system and measured the performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The study aims at developing an applicable methodology to produce the functional land-use map using only free and open-source data. Top-view Sentinel image and ground-view Open Street Map (OSM) data are chosen due to their extensive availability. The three-stage framework, including object-based image analysis, OSM data cleaning, and ontology-based decision fusion, is proposed and implemented with open-source tools. We applied the developed approach to districts 1, 4, and 7 of HoChiMinh city, representing the complexities of the dynamic change in big cities. The result showed a good functional land use map with 78.70% overall accuracy. The outcome presents the mismatch between the data-driven approach and human knowledge, which can be improved by ontology-based fusion with OSM data. The ontology-based framework comprises the common urban land-use classes and OSM attributes, which can be applied and extended in other urban areas. Additional text attributes may be applicable only locally and can be modified in our open-source framework. Object-based image analysis takes advantage of Google Earth Engine computing power, whereas ontology-based processing works well on a local computer. In future studies, adopted natural language processing to pre-process OSM data and ontology-based fusion will be implemented on the cloud-computing platform to enhance computational efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays corporate Intranet Security Monitoring generally relies on SIEM products or SOC platforms. The data comes from a large number of system logs, application running logs and business data, which are generated by network device, security protection device and application systems, etc., is finally stored as normalized data after word segmentation, field parsing and data type mapping. The Intranet Security Monitoring are extremely sensitive to data quality because of the efficiency and accuracy requirements, but the continuous business changes and system upgrades in the intranet environment make both of the data structure and content variable. The existing automated log parsing algorithms are mainly aimed at system logs with a fixed structure, cannot handle variable data with multiple types and structures, besides, the parsing work only completes word segmentation and field parsing. As for data type identification and mapping, there should be several security experts to wait to write static templates, in case the data is changed. In response to the above problems, an ontology model of data knowledge for Intranet Security Monitoring is constructed, and using the computing power of cloud computing, a dynamic processing algorithm for variable data (DPAVD) based on structural information entropy is proposed, in which the correlation between data fields is used as the core factor, can reduce the interference caused by the difference in character expression and meet the requirements of high-quality data for Intranet Security Monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Use of traditional medicines to resolve healthcare issues in developing countries is widespread and increasing. Despite of this, knowledge of traditional medicines is getting lost. One of the major reasons is absence of appropriate knowledge preservation and sharing system. The aim of this paper is to design a comprehensive cloud based knowledge sharing system for traditional medicines community. This has been done by doing a comparative study of existing systems and techniques. It provides an additional feature of disease diagnosis on the basis of symptoms and guides about their treatment. It has the ability to provide data manipulation functions through cloud. Data is store on cloud knowledge base in form of ontology. Validation process of system is done by quantitative analysis of general and expert users response on technology acceptance model based questioner. This questioner shows 60–80% users give positive response. System usability features based comparison is also done to show system effectiveness. Comparison shows almost all features of comprehensive system are available in the developed system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the SPARQL query processing community, as well as in the wider databases community, benchmark reproducibility is based on releasing datasets and query workloads. However, this paradigm breaks down for federated query processors, as these systems do not manage the data they serve to their clients but provide a data-integration abstraction over the actual query processors that are in direct contact with the data. As a consequence, benchmark results can be greatly affected by the performance and characteristics of the underlying data services. This is further aggravated when one considers benchmarking in more realistic conditions, where internet latency and throughput between the federator and the federated data sources is also a key factor. In this paper we present KOBE, a benchmarking system that leverages modern containerization and Cloud computing technologies in order to reproduce collections of data sources. In KOBE, data sources are formally described in more detail than what is conventionally provided, covering not only the data served but also the specific software that serves it and its configuration as well as the characteristics of the network that connects them. KOBE provides a specification formalism and a command-line interface that completely hides from the user the mechanics of provisioning and orchestrating the benchmarking process on Kubernetes-based infrastructures; and of simulating network latency. Finally, KOBE automates the process of collecting and comprehending logs, and extracting and visualizing evaluation metrics from these logs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Web service (WS) presents a good solution to the interoperability of different types of systems that aims to reduce the overhead of high processing in a resource-limited environment. With the increasing demand for mobile WS (MWS), the WS discovery process has become a significant challenging point in the WS lifecycle that aims to identify the relevant MWSs that best match the service requests. This discovery process is a resource-consuming task that cannot be performed efficiently in a mobile computing environment due to the limitations of mobile devices. Meanwhile, a cloud computing can provide rich computing resources for mobile environments given its unlimited and easily scalable resources. This paper proposes a semantic WS discovery and invocation framework in mobile environments based on cloud and a relationship-Awarematchmaking algorithm. The discovery algorithm enriches MWS and user requests semantically with the functional and non-functional properties of Ontology Web Language for Services, such as Quality of Web Service, device context, and user preferences. The WS repository is filtered based on logical reasoning and a parameter-based matching algorithm to minimize the matching space and improve runtime performance. The cosine similarity between the user request and services repository is then assessed to generate the most relevant WS. The relationships among concepts in the ontology are considered to improve the recall and precision ratio. After the WS discovery process, users can invoke and test these services in a mobile environment through a dynamic user interface. The interface of the invocation process is changed according to theWS description document. An application prototype is also developed to evaluate the framework based on a Cordova cross-mobile development framework. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is a mature paradigm that has evolved to accommodate ever-increasing complex applications such as in the AI and HPC domain. If applications are complex, infrastructure can be even more, spanning over hybrid architectures. As such, producing a less error-prone deployment while offering high performance requires application and infrastructure awareness, and also deep knowledge of the IaC languages. In this paper, we present the SODALITE IDE, a suite that assists the users in the authoring of application deployment topology and infrastructure models for IaC. With focus on quality and performance, the IDE enables the faster and simpler development of IaC by offering features such as in-sync multiple model viewpoints , smart context-aware content assistance and semantic validation, powered by a Knowledge Base. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The evolution of Web and cloud services technology has facilitated collaboration on the Web, providing the means for concurrent editing, change tracking and storing files in the cloud (e.g. Google Docs, Office 365). Ontology development teams could greatly benefit from this technology, that until now have been applied mainly to document processing. We introduce CLONE, a Web-based ontology editor that runs in the cloud and provides a real-time collaborative environment for creating and editing ontologies. CLONE is designed as a service-oriented architecture taking advantages of the easy extensibility and scalability features of this approach. CLONE provides all the essential features of stand-alone ontology editors, as well as significant collaboration features, including concurrent editing, editing history, team conversations and role-based access-authorization mechanisms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The arrival of cloud computing age makes data outsourcing an important and convenient application. More and more individuals and organizations outsource large amounts of graph data to the cloud computing platform (CCP) for the sake of saving cost. As the server on CCP is not completely honest and trustworthy, the outsourcing graph data are usually encrypted before they are sent to CCP. The optimal route finding on graph data is a popular operation which is frequently used in many fields. The optimal route finding with support for semantic search has stronger query capabilities, and a consumer can use similar words of graph vertices as query terms to implement optimal route finding. Due to encrypting the outsourcing graph data before they are sent to CCP, it is not easy for data customers to manipulate and further use the encrypted graph data. In this paper, we present a solution to execute privacy-guarding optimal route finding with support for semantic search on the encrypted graph in the cloud computing scenario (PORF). We designed a scheme by building secure query index to implement optimal route finding with support for semantic search based on searchable encryption idea and stemmer mechanism. We give formal security analysis for our scheme. We also analyze the efficiency of our scheme through the experimental evaluation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents an ontology for the structuring of digital databases with the objective of acting in a cloud environment and meeting big data sources in the agricultural context of grain production. Its conception is structured in three stages: the first stage presents an ontological architecture aimed at public and private cloud environments, the second stage deals with a semantic model at process level, and a pseudocode for ontological application is elaborated in the third stage, considering the technologies applied to the cloud. This work combines advanced features to support decision making from Data Lake storage solutions, semantic treatment of big data, as well as the presentation of strategies based on machine learning and data quality analysis to obtain data and metadata organized for application in a decision model. The configuration of the ontology presented meets the diversity of big data projects in the grain production context, the characteristics of which are based on interoperability in the use of heterogeneous data and its integration, elasticity of computational resources, and high availability of cloud access. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Business Intelligence (BI) involves strategies and technologies for the analysis of business information. Business data can be collected using data mining from online resources, reports, operations, social media and from different sources in the big data era. Thus, BI makes use of heterogeneous data for the analysis of the past, present and future of enterprises and this is challenging; mining the data, storing in an appropriate format and managing/analysing/inferencing of the heterogeneous information is difficult. These problems can be alleviated to a great extent using Semantic Web (SW). SW provides technologies to create rich machine-understandable data that can be automatically processed, analysed and consumed by intelligent applications. Therefore, BI can benefit from SW technologies. In this paper, we review BI methods that apply SW for intelligent data mining, processing and analysis of BI procedures. In particular, we summarize and compare different properties of SW and BI methods and how they handle big data. Finally, we discuss how cloud computing technologies can be integrated with SW and BI. Finally, conclude with future open research challenges. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, as a new solution for hiring laborers to complete tasks, crowdsourcing has received universal concern in both academia and industry, which has been widely used in many IT domains such as machine learning, computer vision, information retrieval, software engineering, and so on. The emergence of crowdsourcing undoubtedly facilitates the Knowledge Graph (KG) technology. As an important branch of artificial intelligence that is recently fast developing, the KG technology usually involves machine intelligence and human intelligence, especially in the creation of knowledge graphs, human participation is indispensable, which provides a good scenario for the application of crowdsourcing. This paper first briefly reviews some basic concepts of knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing and knowledge graphs. Then, it discusses three key issues on knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing from the perspectives of task type, selection of workers, and crowdsourcing processes. Finally, it focuses on the construction of knowledge graphs, introducing innovative applications and methods that utilize crowdsourcing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Serving the community is what the Internet - in the broad sense - does in many ways, within the knowledge society. The layers of its ontological structure - technology infrastructure, the Web, and the cloud computing, practical applications (apps), and the “mobile Internet” - are in principle at the service of society. This service is carried out by companies, which are ethically assessable insofar as they are “social subjects.” Their public service purpose at the three layers during the coronavirus lockdown is considered here. Within a framework of business ethics, this article looks deeply at companies as “social subjects.” They contribute decisively to a multilayered reality that reaches half of the world's population. The analysis of this network of networks is carried out through rationality and responsibility. Thus, this paper analyzes its ethical responsibility based on the social ontology of business firms and the ethical problems according to the kind of rationality involved in the companies - micro, meso, or macro - in accordance with their goals. Then, from the perspective of service to society, this study reflects on business ethics of the Internet - in the broad sense - in two directions: 1) the need for evaluative rationality or rationality of ends, because instrumental rationality or rationality of means is insufficient for ethics, and 2) the importance of combining individual responsibility with social responsibility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As we are moving ahead with cloud computing, preference to cloud services is getting increased day by day. These services mostly seem to be significantly identical in their functionality except their key attributes like storage, computational power, price etc. As of now there is no uniform specification for defining a service in cloud domain. In order for specification of the identical operations and publication of the services on the websites, different cloud service providers tend to use completely different vocabulary. The process of requesting for a cloud service becomes merely challenging task as a result of increasing number of selection parameters and QoS constraints. Hence, a reasoning mechanism is very much required for service discovery that could resolve the resemblance appearing across different services by inferring with the respective cloud ontology. In this paper, an ontology based matchmaking technique has been proposed for cloud service discovery and selection using a distributed cloud platform called Aneka Platform as a Service (PaaS). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to examine the research themes and their relationships of library and information science (LIS) in mainland China during the period of 2013–2018. Data were collected from the China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (CAJD) and co-word analysis method was employed to measure correlation among the extracted key words. Seventeen theme-clusters, network characteristics (centre and density), clustering strategy diagram, and correlation network are revealed through cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and social network analysis. The results show that in recent years research on LIS in China, several important research themes like Electronic Government, Reading Promotion, and Social Media have emerged with high relevance, which can be considered as concentrated, mature and well-developed. Some research topics such as Ontology, Big data, and Cloud Computing have developed on a considerable scale, while others remain isolated and undeveloped like Knowledge Sharing and Virtual Community. In addition, the current research has also identified a few of emerging research topics with great potential for development like Mobile Library, Subject Services, and User Experience. The study is beneficial to understand the overall picture of research themes and their relationships of LIS in China in recent years to provide support for follow-up research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing demand for cloud computing has led cloud service providers (CSPs) to offer a variety of services to consumers with different attributes. Currently, cloud consumers are facing problems as they have abundant options for cloud services which may deliver similar functionalities. Moreover, discovering the best and most suitable service which meets the user requirements such as speed, cost, performance, and security is a crucial concern. In order to understand and solve this problem, a novel approach is required which can search and retrieve most suitable services as per the user’s necessities. In this paper an ontology-based cloud service discovery system is presented which can help increase the precision of cloud service discovery actually. The main goal is to categorize the cloud services along with its individualities and store them as objects using ontology. Attributes like cost, security, and SLA (service-level agreements), and so on are defined for these objects. A crawler retrieves and categorizes cloud services and stores them into ontology directory. Once the services are stored in ontology directory, this directory can be utilized for query processing, which processes the query posed by the user and ranks the obtained services based on the concerned attributes. The expected outcome of the posed query will be much accurate and appropriate according to the proposed discovery system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To prevent cyber-attacks, cloud-based systems mainly depend upon different types of intrusion detection systems (IDS). Most of the approaches have high detection rate for known attacks. But in case of unknown attacks or new attacks, these intrusion detection system increases false alarm rate. Another problem is that the reduction of false alarm rate increases the computational complexities in case of genetic algorithm-based IDS and ANN-based IDS. For instance, to tackle challenges like zero-day attack, the only way is to rely upon a robust data-driven approach for security in cloud. Actually in cloud huge amount of data are processed for various activities. It is very difficult to correlate events over such huge amount of data. To improve the abilities of monitoring and fast decision-making, context management is used for correlating events and inferring contexts and evidences. In this paper, a new data-driven framework has been proposed which utilizes ontology and knowledge base to detect cyber-attack with intrusion detection system in cloud. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - After advent of Internet and cloud computing technology, many of the software solutions are hosted in cloud infrastructure (a.k.a SaaS) to enable customers to pay for services as they use. Having this situation, the software non-functional requirements such as ‘availability’ and ‘reliability’ have become critical as customers expect 24 × 7 support for their hosted applications. In such scenario, chatbot or conversational AI becomes more critical to act as the first point of contact to support customer’s queries to reduce multiple round trips between DevOps (Cloud infrastructure support team) to an extent possible. Currently, Team of MoD (manager on duty) is the first point of contact to support for any upcoming customer queries and if in need will be percolated down to team of developer on duty (DoD) for speedy issue resolution. In this paper, we are trying to build a novel solution of adaptive chatbot in providing contextual Q&A responses with built-in natural language template generation, building technical document corpus specific knowledge base, building document text summarization to fit into chatbot real estate, creating corporate technical document indexing to provide important document links and summarized text as response, creating support tickets for the issue reported with automated ticket routing classification to enable speedy resolution of customer queries by DoD with the techniques from information retrieval, information extraction, NLP, NLG, text summarization, text classification and ontology. This paper proposes customized text ranking algorithm by ensuring more weightage is given to document sentences having n-gram linked entities from ontology knowledge base. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Industrial cloud robotics (ICR) integrates cloud computing with industrial robots (IRs). The capabilities of industrial robots can be encapsulated as cloud services and used for ubiquitous manufacturing. Currently, the digital models for process simulation, path simulation, etc. are encapsulated as cloud services. The digital models in the cloud may not reflect the real state of the physical robotic manufacturing systems due to inaccurate or delayed condition update and therefore result in inaccurate simulation and robotic control. Digital twin can be used to realize fine sensing control of the physical manufacturing systems by a combination of high-fidelity digital model and sensory data. In this paper, we propose a framework of digital twin-based industrial cloud robotics (DTICR) for industrial robotic control and its key methodologies. The DTICR is divided into physical IR, digital IR, robotic control services, and digital twin data. First, the robotic control capabilities are encapsulated as Robot Control as-a-Service (RCaaS) based on manufacturing features and feature-level robotic capability model. Then the available RCaaSs are ranked and parsed. After manufacturing process simulation with digital IR models, RCaaSs are mapped to physical robots for robotic control. The digital IR models are connected to the physical robots and updated by sensory data. A case is implemented to demonstrate the workflow of DTICR. The results show that DTICR is capable to synchronize and merge digital IRs and physical IRs effectively. The bidirectional interaction between digital IRs and physical IRs enables fine sensing control of IRs. The proposed DTICR is also flexible and extensible by using ontology models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With great changes in global climate and unusual and extreme weather in recent years, the geological disaster happens more frequently than ever before, so people attach more and more importance to the geo-disaster defending and decreasing for the social economic development especially after the great earthquake in Wenchuan, Sichuan province. As our nation’s great strategy informational source, Geo-hazard information is the key technology in the area of government managing decision, which plays an important role in a project. How to use it has become the key problem. The development of new industry and the promotion of life conditions makes the service based on the geo-information in huge demand. Geo-hazard spatial information sharing service platform is to build a basic spatial information sharing environment. In this environment, the information will be shared in the form of Web services for government agencies, businesses, and the public, provided that geological hazard specifications and standards are followed. Actually, with the development of Internet technology and cloud computing, preliminary results have been achieved on the problem of geographic information sharing and corresponding evaluation work has been carried out. Based on the idea of disaster ontology, the geographic shared service framework is designed and expounded, which is adapted to Wenchuan zone by using data catalog rules. The geo-shared service model is derived from Geo-hazard Spatial Information Sharing Service Model. The design of service interface is expounded. The evaluation and application as well as effective system test is finished based on the Wenchuan geo-disaster evaluation and application system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Medical organizations find it challenging to adopt cloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) services due to the risk of data breaches and the resulting compromise of patient data. Existing authorization models follow a patient-centric approach for EHR management, where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients end. This creates a significant overhead for the patient who must authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given that multiple personnel are typically involved in providing care and that the patient may not always be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need to develop a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy to use cloud-based EHR Service management. We present a novel, centralized, attribute-based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based EHRs access authority to medical providers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Semantic technologies are designed to facilitate context-awareness for web content, enabling machines to understand and process them. However, this has been faced with several challenges, such as disparate nature of existing solutions and lack of scalability in proportion to web scale. With a holistic perspective to web content semantic annotation, this paper focuses on leveraging cloud computing for these challenges. To achieve this, a set of requirements towards holistic semantic annotation on the web is defined and mapped with cloud computing mechanisms to facilitate them. Technical specification for the requirements is critically reviewed and examined against each of the cloud computing mechanisms, in relation to their technical functionalities. Hence, a mapping is established if the cloud computing mechanism's functionalities proffer a solution for implementation of a requirement's technical specification. The result is a cloud computing capability model for holistic semantic annotation which presents an approach towards delivering large-scale semantic annotation on the web via a cloud platform. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud-based electronic health records (EHR) systems provide important security controls by encrypting patient data. However, these records cannot be queried without decrypting the entire record. This incurs a huge amount of burden in network bandwidth and the client-side computation. As the volume of cloud-based EHRs reaches Big Data levels, it is essential to search over these encrypted patient records without decrypting them to ensure that the medical caregivers can efficiently access the EHRs. This is especially critical if the caregivers have access to only certain sections of the patient EHR and should not decrypt the whole record. In this paper, we present our novel approach that facilitates searchable encryption of large EHR systems using Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) and multi-keyword search techniques. Our framework outsources key search features to the cloud side. This way, our system can perform keyword searches on encrypted data with significantly reduced costs of network bandwidth and client-side computation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A framework to integrate structurally different artificial intelligence, machine learning, and control algorithms is combined with an execution framework to create a powerful embedded system development platform. Control, decision, or algorithms providing an emulation of intelligent behavior in both declarative (interpreted) and imperative (compiled) paradigms can now be combined, for example Prolog and neural networks, respectively. This hybridization of algorithms provides more efficient overall control of systems in terms of resources such as compute cycles, network bandwidth and throughput, and memory speed and capacity. By providing an execution framework and control software that is native to embedded system and cloud architectures, and supports interactivity and time synchronization, the true utility of cloud computing and big data systems can be increased. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Computing has undoubtedly been the most disruptive IT paradigm of the last two decades, spanning a wide area of technologies and implementations. Its emergence is already transforming the public sector with relevant e-Government use cases. The adoption of various cloud-related initiatives as part of national strategies is driving the need to use a common framework to better describe, analyse and compare those implementations, known as Governmental Clouds. In addition, for any interoperability to be effective in the long run, a standard framework and common language to describe the relevant ontologies should exist. This paper aims to introduce and discuss a taxonomy of three different models based on the existing and emerging Cloud Computing governmental best practices and available use cases, addressing the lack of relevant concrete definitions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In motion, the interaction relationship between the human body parts is diversified. However, the existing action recognition methods based on the graph convolution neural networks (GCNs) can only deal with a single relation of skeletons. Even some works describe different relations of the skeleton, the adjacency matrices of different relation graphs are added together. This paper proposes a multi-relational GCNs for action recognition following the idea of describing different relations between entities by knowledge graphs. The natural connection relation, symmetric connection relation, and global connection relation of the human body parts are modeled respectively. The features of the relations are transmitted and integrated through the network, which can improve the representation ability of features. Meanwhile, this paper proposes a two-stream multi-relational graph convolution networks (2S-MRGCNs), which processes the joint flow and the body part flow of skeleton data respectively to represent the action more comprehensively. The experimental results show that the 2S-MRGCNs model proposed in this paper has achieved state-of-the-art results on action recognition in kinetics and NTU-RGB+D datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Researchers have attracted much attention to recommender system combined with Knowledge Graph (KG) to address the sparsity issue. Nevertheless, the previous methods cannot use auxiliary information from KG well. They also cannot accurately describe user-item interaction behavior so that it is challenging to construct fine-grained user preferences. To address these issues, we propose a Hybrid recommendation algorithm with Short-term preference and Knowledge preference (HSK), where the short-term preference is captured with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on users' interactive items in the short term. The knowledge preference is captured from the KG's contextual knowledge, in which the attention mechanism determines the weight of the contextual knowledge. Then add two preferences to construct the user preference. Also, explicit ratings are introduced to quantify the user-item interaction behavior at a fine-grained level. Finally, to evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness, we use three datasets MovieLens-20M, Book-Crossing, and Last.FM to verify the model and design different sparse datasets for comparative experiments. In particular, we have further visualization of relevance probability besides traditional prediction tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method shows significant improvements over widely used approaches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Extracting related entity pairs from natural language texts is essential to constructing knowledge graphs. However, prior work is limited by the long distance between entities and cannot accurately extract entities and relationships in the case of relatively complex overlap. To address these limitations, we present Span-RG, a span-based relation extraction model which uses graph convolutional networks to jointly learn entities and relations. First, a boundary prediction task is designed to determine whether a word is an entity boundary, which enhances the span representation to obtain a high quality candidate entity spans. Then, we improve GCN and constructe a span-based entity relationship graph, where the edge is the relationship and the node is the span. We evaluate Span-RG on three public datasets: ACE05, NYT and WebNLG. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the model is significantly better than the baseline method. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the era of big data, the development of mobile Internet and the popularization of mobile terminals have formed massive mobile trajectory data. Reasonable usage of the data will greatly improve the service quality and experience of end users. To analyze hidden activity patterns of end-user in the data, big data query is an important operation and how to enhance the query efficiency remains a challenge issue. However, different data analysis approaches have different applications in different fields, and it is necessary to mine hidden data relationships. In addition, query time is one of important factors to evaluate query efficiency, some researches however mainly focus on query result rather than evaluating query efficiency through multiple contrast approaches. To address these issues, an ontology-based modeling and semantic query strategy for mobile trajectory data is investigated in this paper. First, we respectively employ cosine similarity, point-wise mutual information (PMI) and containment probability model to mine association relationship and containment relationship hidden in the data. Subsequently, an ontology-based model is built to visualize end-user's activity through taxonomy and comparison approaches. Finally, four semantic query methods, e.g., basic query, join query, containment query and combination (join containment) query, are defined through SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) to evaluate query time, and the query efficiency achieved by these investigations has been demonstrated through the conducted experiments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge reasoning oriented to knowledge graphs has always been a hot technology in recent years. Knowledge reasoning requires sufficient evidence and rules to learn its characteristics. However, there are often insufficient data in a lot of data in applications, so The inability to learn good rules reduces the accuracy of knowledge inference results. The IterE iterative loop inference model solves part of the problem of sparse entities, but its robustness is not high. Once there is an error generation, it is easy to cause Wrong overlay. In this paper, the S-IterE model is proposed. Through the combination of reinforcement learning, adversarial neural network and knowledge reasoning, new text is generated, which solves the problem of completing knowledge reasoning in the case of sparse data, and the experimental results have been significantly improved, It is also superior to the existing methods when the sparsity is relatively high, and has good generalization ability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With recent advancement in technology, cloud storage became cheaper enabling organizations around the world to store more data on the cloud (texts, images, videos, databases etc.), whereas it's for a backup, archiving or just storing data streams. New digital laws and regulation (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation) require these organizations to change their way of processing or handling data, which results usually in a change of cloud providers or adoption of hybrid architecture or multi-cloud one. With the amount of data stored increasing year after year, it becomes difficult for these organizations to change cloud platforms or cloud provider and migrate their data without thinking about the technical complexity, the time, and the huge cost it may incur. This article discusses the data migration and interoperability issues between cloud platforms; the proposed approach provides a simple cost-effective migration that would help organizations save time and money in this process based on a hybrid ontology approach for the brokerage of data transfers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Open government data (OGD) is a type of trusted information that can be used to verify the correctness of information on social platforms. Finding interesting OGD to serve personalized needs to facilitate the development of social platforms is a challenging research topic. This study explores how to link the Taiwanese government's open data platform with Facebook and how to recommend related OGD. First, an integrated machine learning with semantic web into cloud computing framework is defined. Next, the linked data query platform (LDQP) is developed to validate its feasibility. The LDQP provides a graphical approach for personal query and links with related Facebook fan pages. LDQP automatically finds highly relevant OGD based on recent topics that users are following on Facebook when users login to Facebook via the LDQP. In this way, the LDQP query result can be dynamically adjusted and graphically displayed according to user's Facebook operations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Decision-making in flood risk management is increasingly dependent on access to data, with the availability of data increasing dramatically in recent years. We are therefore moving towards an era of big data, with the added challenges that, in this area, data sources are highly heterogeneous, at a variety of scales, and include a mix of structured and unstructured data. The key requirement is therefore one of integration and subsequent analyses of this complex web of data. This paper examines the potential of a data-driven approach to support decision-making in flood risk management, with the goal of investigating a suitable software architecture and associated set of techniques to support a more data-centric approach. The key contribution of the paper is a cloud-based data hypercube that achieves the desired level of integration of highly complex data. This hypercube builds on innovations in cloud services for data storage, semantic enrichment and querying, and also features the use of notebook technologies to support open and collaborative scenario analyses in support of decision making. The paper also highlights the success of our agile methodology in weaving together cross-disciplinary perspectives and in engaging a wide range of stakeholders in exploring possible technological futures for flood risk management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The need of real-time enterprises increases according to our life style and customers' satisfaction goal. Real-time business process is one of the important components of a real-time enterprise. For that, a formal definition of real-time concept and real-time process was indispensable. This work presents a formal definition of real-time concept, real-time ontology and a proposition of a real-time component with real-time attributes. This new dimension of time contains three components: latency time, acceptance interval and theoretical time. This definition gives a new vision of time, not just an ordinary vision as periods and calendar but as a response to our needs in real-time enterprises: real-time.

AB  - Fast-growing cloud computing technology makes cloud application scenarios more diversified and difficult to choose. A knowledge recommending system is an effective way to reach automatic recommendation services. In this paper, we constructed a cloud scenario knowledge graph (CSKG) for cloud service market to assist cloud knowledge management and provided a web service interface for recommended applications. First a cloud scenario domain ontology was defined based on product knowledge of cloud suppliers and experience of domain experts. Then the BiLSTM-CRF model and Rule-based method were combined to automatically extract structured knowledge from multi-source and heterogeneous texts, where we proposed a tagging schema combined with entity extraction and relation classifier. Finally, a cloud scenario knowledge graph was constructed and visualized, several application examples based on the CSKG service were suggested. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Globally, aging is now a societal trend and challenge in many developed and developing countries. A key medical strategy that a fast-paced aging society must consider is the provision of quality long-term care (LTC) services. Even so, the lack of LTC caregivers is a persistent global problem. Herein, attention is called to the increasing need for identifying appropriate LTC caregivers and delivering client-specific LTC services to the elderly via emerging and integrative technologies. This paper argues for the use of an intelligent cloud computing long-term care platform (ICCLCP) that integrates statistical analysis, machine learning, and Semantic Web technologies into a cloudcomputing environment to facilitate LTC services delivery. The Term frequency-inverse document frequency is a numerical statistic adopted to automatically assess the professionalism of each LTC caregiver's services. The machine learning method adopts naïve Bayes classifier to estimate the LTC services needed for the elderly. These two items of LTC information are integrated with the Semantic Web to provide an intelligent LTC framework. The deployed ICCLCP will then aid the elderly in the recommendation of LTC caregivers, thereby making the best use of available resources for LTC services. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, security and data access control are some of the major concerns in the cloud storage unit, especially in the medical field. Therefore, a security-aware mechanism and ontology-based data access control (SA-ODAC) has been developed to improve security and access control in cloud computing. The model proposed in this research work is based on two operational methods, namely, secure awareness technique (SAT) and ontology-based data access control (ODAC), to improve security and data access control in cloud computing. The SAT technique is developed to provide security for medical data in cloud computing, based on encryption, splitting and adding files, and decryption. The ODAC ontology is launched to control unauthorized persons accessing data from storage and create owner and administrator rules to allow access to data and is proposed to improve security and restrict access to data. To manage the key of the SAT technique, the secret sharing scheme is introduced in the proposed framework. The implementation of the algorithm is performed by MATLAB, and its performance is verified in terms of delay, encryption time, encryption time, and ontology processing time and is compared with role-based access control (RBAC), context-aware RBAC and context-aware task RBAC, and security analysis of advanced encryption standard and data encryption standard. Ultimately, the proposed data access control and security scheme in SA-ODAC have achieved better performance and outperform the conventional technique. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is considered the latest emerging computing paradigm and has brought revolutionary changes in computing technology. With the advancement in this field, the number of cloud users and service providers is increasing continuously with more diversified services. Consequently, the selection of appropriate cloud service has become a difficult task for a new cloud customer. In case of inappropriate selection of a cloud services, a cloud customer may face the vendor locked-in issue and data portability and interoperability problems. These are the major obstacles in the adoption of cloud services. To avoid these complexities, a cloud customer needs to select an appropriate cloud service at the initial stage of the migration to the cloud. Many researches have been proposed to overcome the issues, but problems still exist in intercommunication standards among clouds and vendor locked-in issues. This research proposed an IEEE multiagent Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agent (FIPA) compliance multiagent reference architecture for cloud discovery and selection using cloud ontology. The proposed approach will mitigate the prevailing vendor locked-in issue and also alleviate the portability and interoperability problems in cloud computing. To evaluate the proposed reference architecture and compare it with the state-of-the-art approaches, several experiments have been performed by utilizing the commonly used performance measures. Analysis indicates that the proposed approach enables significant improvements in cloud service discovery and selection in terms of search efficiency, execution, and response time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, research on machine learning techniques for artificial intelligence has been carried out actively, and many techniques have emerged to apply them. It involves individual studies of techniques ranging from refining input data, learning algorithms, and forecasting. However, it has different areas of application according to techniques, and the semantic association does not apply to refine techniques of input data. To do this, a technique is required to connect the input data using ontology and to perform situational awareness using machine learning. In this paper, we propose a prediction system using machine learning and ontology. The applied machine learning technique is SVM. Through this, it is a system that learns the measured data from the sensor embedded in the smartphone possessed by the elderly and identifies and notifies their status. The main structure of this system uses DBaaS of cloud computing technology, collection, and processing of sensor data that uses fog computing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze cloud reviews according to the end-user context and requirements. Design/methodology/approach: propose a comprehensive knowledge base composed of interconnected Web Ontology Language, namely, modular ontology for cloud service opinion analysis (SOPA). The SOPA knowledge base will be the basis of context-aware cloud service analysis using consumers' reviews. Moreover, the authors provide a framework to evaluate cloud services based on consumers' reviews opinions. Findings: The findings show that there is a positive impact of personalizing the cloud service analysis by considering the reviewers' contexts in the performance of the framework. The authors also proved that the SOPA-based framework outperforms the available cloud review sites in term of precision, recall and F-measure. Research limitations/implications: Limited information has been provided in the semantic web literature about the relationships between the different domains and the details on how that can be used to evaluate cloud service through consumer reviews and latent opinions. Furthermore, existing approaches are lacking lightweight and modular mechanisms which can be utilized to effectively exploit information existing in social media. Practical implications: The SOPA-based framework facilitates the opinion based service evaluation through a large number of consumer's reviews and assists the end-users in analyzing services as per their requirements and their own context. Originality/value: The SOPA ontology is capable of representing the content of a product/service as well as its related opinions, which are extracted from the customer's reviews written in a specific context. Furthermore, the SOPA-based framework facilitates the opinion based service evaluation through a large number of consumer's reviews and assists the end-users in analyzing services as per their requirements and their own context. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Service Level Agreement (SLA) has recently garnered increasing attention in cloud computing due to its capability in the definition and the monitoring of the Quality of Service (QoS). SLA is generally generated following a process of negotiation in which the client chooses a subset of clauses among choices predefined by the provider on a “take it or leave it” basis. However, the heterogeneity between client requests and provider offers may result in inappropriate SLA. In addition, the cloud service context may change over the time, which causes a client requirement adjustment, and therefore, the SLA becomes unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cloud SLA negotiation and re-negotiation approach. Our aim is to ameliorate the SLA negotiation phase by adding the ability to integrate a semantic mapping between client requests and provider offers to generate a suitable SLA document. Moreover, our approach includes a context-aware system to adapt the SLA throughout reasoning techniques and automatically ensure the re-negotiation. We develop a prototype, and we test its performance. The results of a case study also show the efficiency of our approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, cloud computing becomes one of the main orientations of many researchers and companies in the IT area. Therefore, a huge number of cloud services have been developed. Because of the diversity and heterogeneity in providing these services, it is urgently needed to develop a unified cloud ontology. Such ontology can classify these services appropriately and participate as a mapping layer to present such services in a unified description format. Although many studies have been conducted to build cloud ontologies, they have adopted the cloud service layers-based structure. On the other hand, the existing cloud services may involve functionalities from different layers due to the continual increase in the complexity of customer demands. Unfortunately, there are no clear relations to organize the interventions among these layers. Therefore, such services may be difficult to be classified into a specific cloud service layer. Additionally, the layers-based structure of ontologies represents an obstacle to address important issues, such as cloud service recommendation. Despite there are few cloud service functionality-based cloud ontologies, they suffer from many overlaps, lack of semantic relations, or poor granularity of concepts. Also, all the existing cloud ontologies (i.e., layers-based and functionality-based) lack important criteria, such as completeness, consistency, conciseness, clarity, preciseness, and granularity. In this paper, a comprehensive cloud ontology called CloudFNF has been proposed to overcome such drawbacks. According to the structure of the proposed ontology, cloud services are classified as functionality-based instead of layers-based. Also, non-functional features of cloud services (i.e., configuration and QoS features) are considered to enable services of the same functionalities to be ranked efficiently. Based on our previously suggested cloud ontology evaluation framework, our proposed cloud ontology has been evaluated compared to the most related cloud ontologies. The evaluation results show that the proposed CloudFNF ontology outperforms the other ontologies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data has emerged as a central commodity in most modern applications. Unregulated and rampant collection of user and usage data by applications led to concerns on privacy, trust, and ethics. This has resulted in several governments and organizations across geographies to frame laws on data (e.g., the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) that govern and define boundaries for the storage, processing and transitioning of data; and thereby safeguard the interests of its citizens. Data Sovereignty and Data Localization are two important aspects, which deal with the adherence to the laws and governance structures, that define where and how data is collected and processed. The applicability of different laws depends upon several attributes such as the nature, type, and purpose of data. Non-compliance to laws/regulations can lead to serious repercussions for enterprises, ranging from hefty penalties to loss of brand value. Ensuring that all of their applications are complaint to various laws and regulations is non-trivial. Enterprises have to deal with a plethora of laws (that are constantly evolving) and are often confused even in correctly identifying all the applicable laws for their context leave alone ensuring compliance to regulations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a knowledge graph based data sovereignty governance framework that assists in classifying data and in identifying the relevant applicable laws. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to support the intelligent combat capability of future wars, the network information system needs in-depth research and exploration in the field of artificial intelligence. This paper designs a distributed aggregation storage mode with the characteristics of balanced storage load distribution and local node aggregation storage under Big Table model. A distributed parallel query engine that uses the Group-By mode to distribute parallel computation query trees. A knowledge map completion method based on Bayesian inference is proposed. Bayesian probabilistic inference theory and RDF implication inference rules are used to jointly infer the potential relationships between entity nodes to predict the relationship between new nodes and original nodes, thus improving the mining efficiency of potential factors in the model and the accuracy of prediction of unknown relationships. Based on Big Table model, the entity sets stored row by row are evenly divided and stored through random prefix and pre-partition operations to realize load balancing. At the same time, random prefixes can be uniformly distributed to nodes for storing entities of the same type, and aggregated by entity category on a single node. With the continuous development of knowledge map technology, future knowledge map learning and reasoning technology can be integrated with new fields such as machine depth learning, cloud computing, block chain, big data, biological genetic engineering, etc. to play an important social value. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud robotics (CR) is currently a growing area in the robotic community. Indeed, the use of cloud computing to share data and resources of distributed robotic systems leads to the design and development of cloud robotic systems (CRS) which constitute useful technologies for a wide range of applications such as smart manufacturing, aid and rescue missions. However, in order to get coherent agent-to-cloud communications and efficient agent-to-agent collaboration within these CRS, there is a need to formalize the knowledge representation in CR. Hence, the use of ontologies provides a mean to define formal concepts and their relations in an interoperable way. This paper presents standard robotic ontologies and their extension in the CR domain as well as their possible implementations in the case of a real-world CR scenario. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the heterogeneity nature and the huge number of published cloud services, as well as, the continuous increase of the users’ complexity demands, the discovery process of cloud services remains an open issue. According to our conducted comprehensive survey study, the existing cloud service discovery solutions suffer from a set of drawbacks; missing a standardized and comprehensive specification of cloud services, not considering the lack of knowledge about cloud concepts, and not considering the continuous increase of the complex cloud services published to meet the complexity of the users’ demands. In this paper, a comprehensive, standardized, flexible, and intelligent cloud service discovery framework is proposed to overcome these drawbacks. According to this framework, a comprehensive ontology has been developed to provide a standardized semantic specification of cloud services based on their functional features and non-functional features. For exploiting the high performance of the relational databases in managing the large amounts of data and improving the effectiveness of the proposed framework, instances of the non- functional features’ ontological concepts are separated from the developed ontology to be stored in a relational database, where Ontop OBDA platform is used to translate the complex queries over the ontology to SQL queries that are understood by the underlying relational database source. Also, our proposed framework provides a user-centric interface that enables users with low knowledge about cloud concepts to compose complex queries using their natural English language. The effectiveness evaluation shows that the proposed framework provides better results than other solutions. According to the implementation results, the average amount of error expected to identify a service by using the proposed framework is 11% compared to 31% by using the Cloudle service discovery solution. Also, the framework achieves entirely the cloud service discovery evaluation criteria compared to 66% of these criteria for the current cloud service discovery solutions. For efficiency, the proposed framework achieves 88% F-Score for mapping cloud services into suitable functional features and 80% for discovering services that match the users’ queries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: DNA methylation is a crucial epigenomic mechanism in various biological processes. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology, methylated cytosine sites can be revealed at the single nucleotide level. However, the WGBS data analysis process is usually complicated and challenging. Results: To alleviate the associated difficulties, we integrated the WGBS data processing steps and downstream analysis into a two-phase approach. First, we set up the required tools in Galaxy and developed workflows to calculate the methylation level from raw WGBS data and generate a methylation status summary, the mtable. This computation environment is wrapped into the Docker container image DocMethyl, which allows users to rapidly deploy an executable environment without tedious software installation and library dependency problems. Next, the mtable files were uploaded to the web server EpiMOLAS_web to link with the gene annotation databases that enable rapid data retrieval and analyses. Conclusion: To our knowledge, the EpiMOLAS framework, consisting of DocMethyl and EpiMOLAS_web, is the first approach to include containerization technology and a web-based system for WGBS data analysis from raw data processing to downstream analysis. EpiMOLAS will help users cope with their WGBS data and also conduct reproducible analyses of publicly available data, thereby gaining insights into the mechanisms underlying complex biological phenomenon. The Galaxy Docker image DocMethyl is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/lsbnb/docmethyl/. EpiMOLAS_web is publicly accessible at http://symbiosis.iis.sinica.edu.tw/epimolas/. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid development of the Internet, intelligent QA (Question Answering) system has been widely used in telecom operators, financial services, e-commerce shopping and other industries, but there are few researches and applications of intelligent QA system in the field of Chinese classical poetry. In view of the above situation, this paper aims to implement an automatic QA system based on the knowledge graph of Chinese classical poetry by combining natural language processing technology. In terms of the construction of knowledge graph, the common triads of Chinese classical poetry knowledge was extracted from the classical poetry websites and the knowledge graph of Chinese classical poetry stored with Neo4j was constructed. In the aspect of question recognition and multi-round dialogue, the Rasa framework was adopted to extract the entity and identify the intention of the user's questions in Chinese classical poetry, so as to realize multi-round dialogue. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the last decade, cloud computing has emerged as a new paradigm for delivering various on-demand virtualized resources as services. Cloud services have inherited not only the major characteristics of web services but also their classical issues, in particular, the interoperability issues and the heterogeneous nature of their hosting environments. This latter problem must be taken into account when composing various cloud services, in order to answer users' complex requirements. Moreover, leading cloud providers started to offer their services across multiple clouds. This adds a new factor of heterogeneity, as composition engines must take into consideration the heterogeneity not only at the service level (eg, service descriptions) but also at the cloud level (eg, pricing models, security policies). In this context, the semantics of multicloud actors must be incorporated into the multicloud service composition (MCSC) process. However, most existing approaches have treated the semantic service composition in traditional single-cloud environments. The few works in multicloud settings have ignored the semantics of cloud zones and resources. Moreover, they often focus on the general aspect of MCSC (eg, horizontal or vertical compositions). Even the few researchers who have addressed both vertical and horizontal service compositions, conducted their research studies in the context of single- cloud environments, which were proven to be unrealistic and offer limited quality of service (QoS) and security support. To ensure a high interoperability when composing services from multiple heterogeneous clouds and to enable a horizontal/vertical semantic service compositions, we take advantage of a standardized and semantically enriched generic service description, including all aspects (technical, operational, business, semantic, contextual) and supporting different cloud service models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc). We also incorporate Semantic Web Rule Language into the MCSC process to enable not only rule-based reasoning about various composition constraints (eg, QoS constraints, cloud zones constraints) but also to provide accurate semantic matching of cloud services' capabilities. Conducted experiments have proven the ability of our approach to combine high-quality services from the optimal number of clouds. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence of searchable encryption technology sheds new light on the problem of secure search over encrypted data, which has been a research hotspot in the past few years. However, most existing search schemes based on searchable encryption only support queries in a certain language. The few searchable encryption schemes that have implemented multilingual search fail to achieve automated cross-lingual retrieval, which significantly impacts users search experience. Additionally, most of these schemes only support the exact matching and can-not provide semantic search. Hence, the implementation of cross-lingual and semantic search together remains an open topic for searchable encryption. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has investigated the problem of cross-lingual ranked search over encrypted cloud data. To address this issue, we propose a cross-lingual multi-keyword rank search (CLRSE) scheme upon the Open Multilingual Wordnet. Our CLRSE scheme can break the barrier of languages, and realizes intelligent and personalized search through flexible keyword and language preference settings. Additionally, an improved scheme is developed to speed up the sorting process. We evaluate the performance of our scheme including security, functionality, precision, and efficiency, with extensive experiments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Semantic and cloud computing technologies have become vital elements for developing and deploying solutions across diverse fields in computing. While they are independent of each other, they can be integrated in diverse ways for developing solutions and this has been significantly explored in recent times. With the migration of web-based data and applications to cloud platforms and the evolution of the web itself from a social, web 2.0 to a semantic, web 3.0 comes as the convergence of both technologies. While several concepts and implementations have been provided regarding interactions between the two technologies from existing research, without an explicit classification of the modes of interaction, it can be quite challenging to articulate the interaction modes; hence, building upon them can be a very daunting task. Hence, this research identifies and describes the modes of interaction between them. Furthermore, a “cloud-driven” interaction mode which focuses on fully maximising cloud computing characteristics and benefits for driving the semantic web is described, providing an approach for evolving the semantic web and delivering automated semantic annotation on a large scale to web applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the development of cloud computing technology, the microservice architecture (MSA) has become a prevailing application architecture in cloud-native applications. Many user-oriented services are supported by many microservices, and the dependencies between services are more complicated than those of a traditional monolithic architecture application. In such a situation, if an anomalous change happens in the performance metric of a microservice, it will cause other related services to be downgraded or even to fail, which would probably cause large losses to dependent businesses. Therefore, in the operation and maintenance job of cloud applications, it is critical to mine the causality of the problem and find its root cause as soon as possible. In this paper, we propose an approach for mining causality and diagnosing the root cause that uses knowledge graph technology and a causal search algorithm. We verified the proposed method on a classic cloud-native application and found that the method is effective. After applying our method on most of the services of a cloud-native application, both precision and recall were over 80%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The long awaited cloud computing concept is a reality now due to the transformation of computer generations. However, security challenges have become the biggest obstacles for the advancement of this emerging technology. A well-established policy framework is defined in this paper to generate security policies which are compliant to requirements and capabilities. Moreover, a federated policy management schema is introduced based on the policy definition framework and a multi-level policy application to create and manage virtual clusters with identical or common security levels. The proposed model consists in the design of a well-established ontology according to security mechanisms, a procedure which classifies nodes with common policies into virtual clusters, a policy engine to enhance the process of mapping requests to a specific node as well as an associated cluster and matchmaker engine to eliminate inessential mapping processes. The suggested model has been evaluated according to performance and security parameters to prove the efficiency and reliability of this multi-layered engine in cloud computing environments during policy definition, application and mapping procedures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of Cloud-based development of mobile applications, third-party services to be integrated by applications often have to be manually selected among many categories and providers at design time. Over the years, recommender systems have proven effective in overcoming the challenges related to the incredible growth of the information on the Web. In an effort to better address this problem, the use of Semantic Web technologies in the development of recommender systems has been gaining momentum in recent years. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based Collaborative Filtering recommendation approach for the discovery of services in a mobile Cloud computing platform for services-based development. Our approach employs a knowledge-based technique that takes advantage of Semantic Web rule-based reasoning capabilities. A major contribution of this work is a multi-criteria collaborative service evaluation mechanism that is based on a standard service quality framework and is built on top of an ontology-based domain model. A two-part evaluation method that is intended to evaluate the proposed recommendation approach not only from a Computer Science perspective but also from an Information Systems perspective is also presented. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - cloud computing service is the most important services for many of the organizations. The service providers must ensure of their security and protection techniques to guarantee to protect the client data. There are some cloud security guidelines that supports the cloud data security are need to be followed by the vendors. Despite the fact, the vendors are facing the mess of security and protection controls and eventually leads to an confusion among the consumers on concerning the safety efforts and whether their measures satisfies the security measures. An inclusive report to survey the risk and security issues faced by cloud consumers have depicted to control the hazards. In light of this investigation, an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances framed. a web based cloud application is designed to recommend the cloud security policies from the ontology such that it also helps the existing cloud providers. Security strategies can also be planned by the consumers by utilizing the web application that describing the ontology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Our primary research hypothesis stands on a simple idea: The evolution of top-rated publications on a particular theme depends heavily on the progress and maturity of related topics. And this even when there are no clear relations or some concepts appear to cease to exist and leave place for newer ones starting many years ago. We implemented our model based on Computer Science Ontology (CSO) and analyzed 44 years of publications. Then we derived the most important concepts related to Cloud Computing (CC) from the scientific collection offered by Clarivate Analytics. Our methodology includes data extraction using advanced web crawling techniques, data preparation, statistical data analysis, and graphical representations. We obtained related concepts after aggregating the scores using the Jaccard coefficient and CSO Ontology. Our article reveals the contribution of Cloud Computing topics in research papers in leading scientific journals and the relationships between the field of Cloud Computing and the interdependent subdivisions identified in the broader framework of Computer Science. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Working prototypes of the scalable semantic web portals, which are deployed on cloud platforms and intended for use in universities educational activity, are discussed. The first project is related to teaching in the field of nuclear physics and nuclear power engineering. The second project is related to training in computer science and programming. The possibility of using the DLLearner software in conjunction with the Apache Jena Reasoners in order to refine the ontologies that are designed on the basis of the SROIQ(D) description logic is shown. A software agent for the context-sensitive searching for new knowledge in the WWW has been developed as a toolkit for ontologies enrichment. The binary Pareto relation and Levenshtein metrics are used in order to evaluate the measure of compliance of the found content concerning a specific domain. It allows the knowledge engineer to calculate the measure of the proximity of an arbitrary network resource about classes and objects of specific knowledge graphs. The suggested software solutions are based on cloud computing using DBaaS and PaaS service models to ensure the scalability of data warehouses and network services. Examples of applying the software and technologies under discuss are given. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To achieve more accurate recommendations, a consensus of the research community is that not only explicit information (i.e., historical user-item interactions) but also implicit information (i.e., side information) should be utilized. Generally, both explicit and implicit information can be categorized according to the following assumptions: 1) Users with same behaviors are similar; 2) Items related to the same user are similar; 3) Items with same attributes are similar; and 4) Users with same interests are similar. However, none of existing studies has fully explored such information. To this end, we put forward Multi-dimension Interactions based Knowledge Graph Neural Networks (MI-KGNN), i.e., a GNN-based recommendation model that characterizes the similarity between users and items through embedding propagation in the knowledge graph. Specifically, apart from the traditional user-item and item-user interactions, we define another two types of interactions by introducing three different bipartite graphs. On one hand, we explore the interaction between items and the neighborhood during the information aggregation process. On the other hand, we explore the interaction between users and the neighborhood during embedding propagation. These interactions allow information to propagate in the direction indicated by the above four assumptions. In such a way, MI-KGNN effectively extracts both semantic information and structural information in the knowledge graph. Experimental results show that MI-KGNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in top-K recommendations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Application service providers implement Software-as-a-Service applications through a large number of Cloud Computing infrastructures. It is an increasingly challenging demand to discover trusted service providers based on services’ outputs. However, the quality of service output may descend due to: (a) internal application logic of a Cloud service and (b) competition of resources in the sharing-based Cloud systems. Therefore, we propose an efficient method of trusted service provider discovery, called TSD (Trusted Service Discovery), to ensure that each service instance of composite services in Cloud systems is trustworthy. TSD treats all services as black boxes, and evaluates the outputs of service providers in service classes to obtain their equivalent or nonequivalent relationships. According to the equivalent or nonequivalent relationships, trusted service providers can be found easily. TSD improves accuracy of processing results as shown in experiments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Automated deployment and management of Cloud applications relies on descriptions of their deployment topologies, often referred to as Infrastructure Code. As the complexity of applications and their deployment models increases, developers inadvertently introduce software smells to such code specifications, for instance, violations of good coding practices, modular structure, and more. This paper presents a knowledge-driven approach enabling developers to identify the aforementioned smells in deployment descriptions. We detect smells with SPARQL-based rules over pattern-based OWL 2 knowledge graphs capturing deployment models. We show the feasibility of our approach with a prototype and three case studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To address data protection concerns, authorities and standards bodies worldwide have released a plethora of regulations, guidelines, and software controls to be applied to Cloud data. As a result, service providers maintaining their end-user's private attributes have seen a surge in compliance requirements. Since most of these regulations are not available in a machine-processable format, it requires significant manual effort to adhere to them. Often many of the laws have overlapping rules, but as they are not referencing each other, providers must duplicate efforts to comply with each regulation. We have done a detailed study of all the data protection regulations that apply to Cloud data. We have developed an integrated, semantically rich knowledge graph that captures these various data compliance regulations. It includes the data threats and security controls that are needed to mitigate the risks. In this paper, we present this knowledge graph in detail, along with the system that we have developed to evaluate it. We have validated our knowledge graph against the privacy policies of various Cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, IBM, and Rackspace. This knowledge graph is available in the public domain and can be used by organizations to automate their compliance processes and set their enterprise Cloud security policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Current mobile cloud database systems are widespread and require special considerations for mobile devices. Although many systems rely on numerous metrics for use and optimization, few systems leverage metrics for decisional cache replacement on the mobile device. In this paper we introduce the Lowest Scored Replacement (LSR) policy—a novel cache replacement policy based on a predefined score which leverages contextual mobile data and user preferences for decisional replacement. We show an implementation of the policy using our previously proposed MOCCAD-Cache as our decisional semantic cache and our Normalized Weighted Sum Algorithm (NWSA) as a score basis. Our score normalization is based on the factors of query response time, energy spent on mobile device, and monetary cost to be paid to a cloud provider. We then demonstrate a relevant scenario for LSR, where it excels in comparison to the Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache replacement policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Insider Threats, who are cloud internal users, cause very serious problems, which in terns, leads to devastating attacks for both individuals and organizations. Although, most of the attentions, in the real world, is for the outsider attacks, however, the most damaging attacks come from the Insiders. In cloud computing, the problem becomes worst in which the number of insiders are maximized and hence, the amount of data that can be breached and disclosed is also maximized. Consequently, insiders' threats in the cloud ought to be one of the top most issues that should be handled and settled. Classical solutions to defend against insiders' threats might fail short as it is not easy to track both activities of the insiders as well as the amount of knowledge an insider can accumulate through his/her privileged accesses. Such accumulated knowledge can be used to disclose critical information –which the insider is not privileged to-through expected dependencies that exist among different data items that reside in one or more nodes of the cloud. This paper provides a solution that suits well the specialized nature of the above mentioned problem. This solution takes advantage of knowledge bases by tracking accumulated knowledge of insiders through building Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for each insider. It also takes advantage of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) by building a fog layer where a mitigation unit-resides on the edge-takes care of the insiders threats in a place that is as close as possible to the place where insiders reside. As a consequence, this gives continuous reactions to the insiders' threats in real-time, and at the same time, lessens the overhead in the cloud. The MEC model to be presented in this paper utilizes a knowledgebase approach where insiders' knowledge is tracked and modeled. In case an insider knowledge accumulates to a level that is expected to cause some potential disclosure of private data, an alarm will be raised so that expected actions should be taken to mitigate this risk. The knowledgebase approach involves generating Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Dependency Graphs (DGs) where a Threat Prediction Value (TPV) is evaluated to estimate the risk upon which alarms for potential disclosure are raised. Experimental analysis has been conducted using CloudExp simulator where the results have shown the ability of the proposed model to raise alarms for potential risks from insiders in a real time fashion with accurate precision. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to improve the self-learning ability of cloud computing and scheduling ability of big data resources in open interactive education, an open interactive education algorithm based on cloud computing and big data is proposed. An information flow model for open education big data is constructed, and big data mining is conducted to an open interactive education platform through the association rules mining method based on parallel scheduling to extract semantic ontology information feature quantity of interactive education; spatial attribute clustering is performed in the cloud computing environment according to the feature extraction results, and big data information is scheduled through the multi-feature weight allocation method. Simulation results show that in open interactive education, this method can cause relatively good output performance of big data mining, relatively high accuracy of feature information clustering of open interactive education and relatively strong feature resolution and recognition ability of data output, which meets the educational resource scheduling and allocation requirements of open education. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is a promising computing paradigm that involves outsourcing of computing resources with the capabilities of on demand provisioning with little or no up-front investment costs. Resource description framework (RDF) is the semantic data model for cloud computing which provides interoperability but is not effective in terms of scalability, formal semantics and query optimisation and reification. One of the key challenges in cloud computing therefore is to enhance RDF data model. This paper introduces a data model which uses hybrid approach of provenance aware context entity (PACE) and quadruples method of reification. The scope of the research is to understand the importance of RDF reification, limitations and its impact on creating an efficient data model. This hybrid RDF data model is deployed and tested for its performance on the AWS public cloud. Experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid data model enhances accessibility, maintainability, and also accelerates query execution time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Geospatial information has transformed into a primary consumer good in our society. Worldwide, governmental organizations have contributed to this reality through Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs), promoting economic development, stimulating better governance, and fostering environmental sustainability. These initiatives have been settled according to three stages of development. Recently, the community is witnessing an emerging fourth stage in the SDI evolution, because of mainstream Information Technologies (IT), and where different IT trends (such as Big Data, cloud computing, or Semantic Web) are already being integrated as part of SDIs worldwide. Nevertheless, their implementation states change among countries according to the initial context and the Digital Divide. Therefore, it is essential to understand the adoption process characteristics, and especially in Latin America, where no previous evidence about the state of geospatial IT trend adoption is available. This paper contributes to an exploratory inquiry for unveiling the diversity of the fourth SDI generation in the Latin American SDI community. For that, we used an open-regional web-based survey, which was divided into four blocks (trend adoption, standardization, monitoring, and future vision and limitations) and performed three times (2014, 2017, 2018/2019). The results depicted the initial presence of IT trends with a heterogeneity scenario. In this way, some initiatives are exploring the fourth generation, while others remain at different stages between the first and third generations. This work pointed out the need for a regional observatory to allow designing policies and action plans associated with the progress of the fourth SDI generation in Latin America. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper describes conceptual and technological principles of the human-computer cloud, that allows to deploy and run human-based applications. It also presents two ways to build decision support services on top of the proposed cloud environment for problems where workflows are not (or cannot be) defined in advance. The first extension is represented by a decision support service leveraging task ontology to build the missing workflow, the second utilizes the idea of human-machine collective intelligence environment, where the workflow is defined in the process of a (sometimes, guided) collaboration of the participants. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As the number of cloud services and user interest data soars, it’s hard for users to find suitable could services within a short time. A suitable cloud service automatic recommendation system can effectively solve this problem. In this work, we propose KGCF, a novel method to recommend users cloud services that meet their needs. We model user-item and item-item bipartite relations in a knowledge graph, and study property-specific user-item relation features from it, which are fed to a collaborative filtering algorithm for Top-N item recommendation. We evaluate the proposed method in terms of Top-N recommendation on the MovieLens 1M dataset, and prove it outperforms numbers of state-of-the-art recommendation systems. In addition, we prove it has well performance in term of long tail recommendation, which means that more kinds cloud services can be recommended to users instead of only hot items. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - When searching for the interesting content within a specific website, how to describe the initial need by selecting proper keywords is a critical problem. The character-matching search functions of website can hardly meet users’ requirements. Furthermore, building the content of webpages of a specific web-site and the associated rules is uneconomical. This paper, based on the framework of the Lucene engine, applied a semantic ontology, the calculation of the relevance of word entries, and the semantics of keywords to design an intelligent semantic recommendation system with the Jena secondary semantic analysis technique. Subsequently, the expanded keywords were semantically ranked based on the term frequency analysis technique. Meanwhile, the ontology algorithm and their relevance were introduced as the dynamic weight values. Finally, in the text content retrieval process, the search results were ranked based on the previous relevance weights. The experimental results show that the system designed in this paper is not only easy to develop but also capable of expanding users queries and recommending relevant content. Further, the system can improve the precision and recall for website search results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent cloud search engines lack a formal method in their service composition mechanisms to automatically build composite services realizing user requirements. This paper prescribes behavior composition framework as a formal tools for the search engines. The framework automatically synthesizes a controller that delegates the service operations requested by a cloud user to the proper available cloud services whose operations satisfy the request. Since most cloud search engines support semantic and ontology to discover similar service oper-ations, the paper extends the framework to be more adaptable with such search engines through the use of resource reasoning. Several experiments are provided to demonstrate how the extended framework outperforms the original one in terms of realizing users’ requirements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Consumers are heavily dependent on secure and reliable cloud computing services. However, there are various shortcomings in cloud services, such as those concerning performance, security, trust and privacy, among others. Cloud services consumers do not have enough information on these critical issues neither on compliance with laws and regulations. We present a conceptual framework for trust assessment of cloud computing environments. Our proposal is based on a consumer-centric approach, since it deals with cloud trust aspects from the perspective of end users. For this purpose, metrics and indicators are proposed to allow consumers to assess the trust of cloud services providers. Our contributions are: (1) a conceptual framework with indicators and processes for trust assessment; (2) a lightweight ontology of key concepts of trust assessment; and (3) an application scenario to illustrate the practical adequacy of the conceptual framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As more organizations adopt cloud computing, they are increasingly moving towards a mixture of public, private, and hybrid cloud services and infrastructure. These organizations turn to multicloud, which involves the use of two or more public clouds, to avoid vendor lock-in, overcome latency, mitigate risks, and control costs. The use of multicloud does have some advantages, such as flexibility and redundancy, but comes with some management, security, and privacy challenges as well. To overcome some of the security challenges, organizations would have to capture and analyze security and privacy policies across multiple clouds to ensure the policies are free from errors and enforce them at runtime independent of the cloud provider. In this paper, we present CERBERUS, a framework for representing multicloud security and privacy policies and detecting potential problems in the policies. CERBERUS adopts an object-oriented approach and consists of an ontology and notation, policies, guidelines and rules, and a tool for capturing and detecting policy errors. Using CERBERUS, policies can be analyzed for potential problems, including policy conflicts, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness. An application of CERBERUS shows that it indeed helps discover policy errors, that would otherwise go undetected, or in many cases would be detected a posteriori at runtime. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, searchable encryption has attracted considerable attention in the field of cloud computing. The existing research mainly focuses on keyword-based search schemes, most of which support the exact matching of keywords. However, keyword-based search schemes ignore spelling errors and semantic expansions of keywords. The significant drawback makes the existing techniques unsuitable in cloud computing as it greatly affects system usability and can not completely satisfy the users' search intentions. In this paper, we propose an effective fuzzy semantic searchable encryption scheme (FSSE) that supports multi-keyword search over encrypted data in cloud computing. In our scheme, we exploit a keyword fingerprint generation algorithm to generate a fingerprint set of the keyword dictionary and a fingerprint of the query keywords, and employ Hamming distance to quantify keywords similarity. Based on the proposed fingerprint generation algorithm and Hamming distance, we realize fuzzy search. Furthermore, we utilize the semantic expansion technique to expand query keywords and calculate the semantic similarity between the query keywords and the expanded word of the query keywords to achieve the semantic search. To improve the search efficiency, we construct an inverted index structure and use the vector intersection matching as well as short-circuit matching operations to effectively filter irrelevant documents. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme satisfies the security guarantee of searchable encryption, enhances system usability, and is more efficient in comparison with the state of the art schemes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Distributed computer integrated manufacturing is increasingly adopting cloud computing, software-as-a-service (SaaS) and multi-agent systems as steps towards “design anywhere, build anywhere” strategy. In this scenario, foundation ontologies not only serve as common message exchange structure among distributed agents but also provide reasoning service to extract implicit knowledge from explicit information already stored in the knowledge base. Computer aided process planning plays key role in computer integrated manufacturing. In this paper, foundation ontology for manufacturing process planning is proposed and validated by modeling the manufacturing process selection information of a prismatic design feature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Computing has been attracting the interest of the Information and Communication Technology Community. It has emerged as a compelling paradigm that assures reliable on-demand computing services over Internet. However, the potential that this new model offers for organizations is still not fully explored. In fact, this technology has not been explored yet to manage Loose Inter-Organizations Cooperation (LIOC). Loose Inter-Organizations Cooperation corresponds to occasional cooperation without structural constraints in which the partners involved and their numbers are not predefined. In order to handle LIOC in Cloud Computing we have proposed the notion of Cloud Workflow Services (CWS). CWS is an Inter-Organizations business process having loosely coupled fragments of process that we called Process Chunks (PCs) whose description and execution are accessible through the Cloud. In our previous work, we have used the Model-Driven Engineering approach to deal with modeling and specifying Contextualized Flexible Cloud Workflow Services. In this work, we focus on the selection of PCs. We propose an ontology based approach permitting a PC_Consumer to select the appropriate PC satisfying its requirements. This selection is done according to two different strategies “MIC-selection” and “MAC-selection”. In MIC-Selection, every PC will be selected using the assembling strategy, that’s mean we have the possibility to assemble multiple PCs. In MAC-Selection, for each PC we will select only the best PC with the highest score of similarity. This work has been validated through the “Drug Development process” with the help of experts from the pharmaceutical field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the past decade or so, knowledge graphs have stealthily made way into our daily lives, whether through voice assistants (the likes of Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri), spontaneous search results or customized personal shopping experiences through online stores recommenders. Today, we are surrounded and constantly interacting with knowledge graphs on a regular basis. The scope and impact of knowledge graphs and underlying graph databases are still a mystery to people. Considering its smooth entry into our lives, most of us are unaware of how dependent we actually are on the technology. In this paper, we have shown the working of the Google knowledge graph and how the knowledge graph works as the most effective recommendation system. We have discussed how it finds its way through daily life in various fields like Banking, Social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, Netflix), Food application (Uber Eats) and the Healthcare sector. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Academic medical centers and health systems are increasingly challenged with supporting appropriate secondary use of clinical data. Enterprise data warehouses have emerged as central resources for these data, but often require an informatician to extract meaningful information, limiting direct access by end users. To overcome this challenge, we have developed Leaf, a lightweight self-service web application for querying clinical data from heterogeneous data models and sources. Materials and Methods: Leaf utilizes a flexible biomedical concept system to define hierarchical concepts and ontologies. Each Leaf concept contains both textual representations and SQL query building blocks, exposed by a simple drag-and-drop user interface. Leaf generates abstract syntax trees which are compiled into dynamic SQL queries. Results: Leaf is a successful production-supported tool at the University of Washington, which hosts a central Leaf instance querying an enterprise data warehouse with over 300 active users. Through the support of UW Medicine (https://uwmedicine.org), the Institute of Translational Health Sciences (https://www.iths.org), and the National Center for Data to Health (https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/), Leaf source code has been released into the public domain at https://github.com/uwrit/leaf. Discussion: Leaf allows the querying of single or multiple clinical databases simultaneously, even those of different data models. This enables fast installation without costly extraction or duplication. Conclusions: Leaf differs from existing cohort discovery tools because it does not specify a required data model and is designed to seamlessly leverage existing user authentication systems and clinical databases in situ. We believe Leaf to be useful for health system analytics, clinical research data warehouses, precision medicine biobanks, and clinical studies involving large patient cohorts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - IP prefix hijacking continues to be a pervasive cyber security threat to the core internet routing infrastructure. The data security of multiple cloud-based services is also susceptible to these threats, due to the high dependency on traditional routing protocols. Although a number of hijacking detection techniques have been recently proposed, no existing system has effectively addressed the problem of detecting malicious transit Autonomous System (AS) services in any detected hijacking occurrences. The ability to locate and isolate malicious services is critical for conducting a necessary mitigation strategy at an early stage, to minimise the impact of the attack, to restore cloud services quickly. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time processing method, so-called Ontological Graph Identification (OGI), for detecting IP prefix hijacking of nodes and suspicious transit nodes caused by the hijacked nodes through ASs. The proposed method is evaluated using the two public datasets of RIPE RIS and RouteView. Experimental results revealed improved performance for the detection of malicious transit nodes compared with peer techniques. It is, therefore, shown that the proposed method has utility in automating the process of investigating nodes with suspicious activities in real network systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to reduce the incidence of disease and decrease the proportion of “sub-health”, exercise regularly is one of the most important factors to solve these problems. Regular exercise has many positive effects on body’s systems, while inappropriate forms of exercise can cause problems or even have adverse consequences for health. Therefore, this research aims to develop an ontology-driven knowledge-based system to dynamically generating personalized exercise programs. The generated plan exposing REST style web services, which can be accessed from any Internet-enabled device and deployed in cloud computing environments. To ensure the practicality of the generated exercise plans, encapsulated knowledge used as a basis for inference in the system is acquired from domain experts. Also, we integrate the system with wearable devices so that we can collect real-time data, for example, heart rate. In the future, break through the limitations of equipment, the accuracy and reliability can be promoted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Eye semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in many works such as identification and medical applications. In this study, three encoder-decoder architectures using convolutional neural network are applied to segment the eyes. A simple encoder-decoder architecture is capable of generating only coarse segmentation results. On the other hand, fine details like eyelashes can be achieved by U-net and SegNet architectures. However, they sometimes produce overall results worse than the simple one. To resolve this problem, we introduce a deep convolutional neural network-based ensemble technique for eye segmentation. The results from those architectures are combined in order to yield good results in both coarse-level and fine-level segmentation. In the proposed technique, a trainable mask function is applied to achieve an optimal ensemble of coarse-level and fine-level results. Our dataset comprises 64 eye images from different environments, camera settings, people, and eye conditions. Experimental results show that our ensemble technique can improve the results from the conventional architectures. The proposed ensemble method manages to reach the average accuracy of 96.33% for three-class segmentation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In exchange of health information, an emerging patient-centric model is ElectronicHealth Record (EHR). ElectronicHealth Record (EHR) is stored in cloud service or outsourced. Exposing these data to third party server and unauthorized user leads to the security issues in the cloud. The EHR is encrypted before storing it in the cloud. This is done to ensure the user with control of their data. The fine-grained as well as cryptographically enforced data access control is still having the issues with exposure of privacy, key management scalability, efficient and flexible access. To rectify this issues, Improved attribute based encryption (IABE) is proposed in this scheme for encrypting EHR file of every patient. Previous works are not focused about multiple data owner situation. In this proposed work, it is dealt by dividing the EHR system users into various domains of security. The complexity in key management is highly reduced by this. The proposed scheme shown its ability in giving security, efficiency and scalability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge discovery is a process that seeks new knowledge about an application domain. It consists of many steps, one of which is data mining, each aiming to complete a discovery task, and accomplished by the application of a discovery method [1]. On this subject, the Semantic Web (SW) is an effort to interchange unstructured data over the Web into a structured format that is processable not only by human beings but also by computers [2]. The SW creates a distributed framework to publish, query, and reuse information [3]. The key backbones of SW are ontologies and annotations that provide semantics for raw data are known as Resource Description Framework (RDF) data [4]. The RDF data can also be published over Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. To highlight the vision of SW, we would like to run a tutorial. The main goal of this tutorial is to provide background knowledge about SW, RDF, Web Ontology Language (OWL), SPARQL, knowledge graph, graph databases, and SW-based applications. This tutorial will show how SW provides explicit models of the terminology of a domain to improve information access. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Using artificial intelligence to solve medical problems has been an intriguing yet challenging topic. In recent years, with the availability of electronic medical records (EMRs), many researchers have focused on diagnose diseases by mining EMRs. They apply machine learning algorithms to train EMRs, and modify models to improve the accuracy of diseases diagnosis. However, these studies input the patient characteristics into the model at once, without multiple online interactions. Or, put another way, although those methods have performed well in the laboratory, they are not suitable for a real consultation environment. In the real world, doctors often guide patients to describe the condition step by step, and then combine the checkup value to diagnose the disease. In this paper, we simulate this process and propose a novel system called DKDR, which combine a knowledge graph and deep reinforcement learning to diagnose disease. The medical knowledge graph is built by crawling 100K web pages, which help users improve the description of disease characteristics. We use q-learning to find the combination of symptoms in the best diagnosis and use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to train each strategy. Finally, we experiment on real medical datasets and synthetic medical datasets. DKDR finds the best combination of symptoms for diagnosing disease. The diagnostic accuracy rates for pneumonia, hyperlipidemia and obesity are 89%, 90% and 92%, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a self-training word embedding text classification model based on knowledge graph expansion for text classification. Current mixed word embedding methods are overly dependent on the Fasttext pre-training model and here is still a problem of missing words with rich semantic information are not mapped. First, we propose a method for extracting missing nouns based on shape near word filtering. Second, we design a self-training word embedding method based on knowledge graph that mixes with pre-training word embedding to obtain a high-quality mixed word vector with rich semantics and rich semantics. Third, we designed a GRU model based on improved mixed word embedding to improve the quality of text classification. Experiments conducted on multiple text classification datasets demonstrate that our methods can effectively improve the text classification accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To solve the problem of low recommendation accuracy caused by too little user behavior information in the current behavior recommendation system, an algorithm based on end-to-end data enhancement was proposed. In this paper, knowledge graph is constructed by learning and integrating structured knowledge network. Moreover, the characteristics of users with high preference similarity can be propagated through the inter-entity relations mapped by the knowledge map to reconstruct the preference vector of users. Through comparative experiments on open data sets, the AUC of RNN model, CNN model, RNN attention model and ATRank were improved by 3.28%, 2.35%, 2.89% and 1.30%, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is witnessing a fast development and widespread adoption from small to large organizations due to its cost-effective and resource-efficient services. Nevertheless, security risks remain major concerns. One of the main challenges is how to evaluate the security level of cloud services. Among the problems arising are the large variety of knowledge associated with the security domain and the heterogeneity of cloud services descriptions. An effective solution to such problems is ontologies. Ontologies provide a more structured and formal representation of a particular domain, which will help to reduce the conceptual ambiguity and enable automatic reasoning functionalities. In this paper, we propose an ontology for cloud services security evaluation based on industry standards and best practices. Some of the core concepts included in the ontology are the target, criteria, yardstick, data gathering techniques and data synthesis approaches. The concepts are grouped into five general categories, namely: context, assumptions, external factors, activities, and outcomes. The ontology is implemented using Protégé tool and validated through different uses case scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The system for backing up the data is designed. Client software works on the computer of user, takes all the necessary files for backup, and turns them into Stream of bytes. Then breaks it into blocks (from 32 KB to 64KB) using a Rabin algorithm. It is based on hash ring that is absorbing every incoming byte if the current hash mask or equal to a certain reach 64KB, there is division committed. This approach helps to avoid is coping all data if the content of a file has changed in separately. For each data block client software calculates the hash. Then sends parts even 256 times or more of those hashes to the server and checks if they already know the system. The blocks are not known, refers to the server. As part of the de-duplication, data on distribution and cloud distribution occurs on hashes, hashes are SHA-1, so that 20 bytes are given in hexadecimal format. First number or letter and will serve key distribution. So essentially, you can evenly distribute the data among the workers from 2 to 16 pieces. You need to take the second number of hash, and more commit distribution. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of Cloud computing led to an increase in the number of services ready for use and therefore the number of consumers' requests. Cloud providers advertise the description of their offered services in different formats on the Internet. This makes the discovery and selection of services more difficult for users. Thus, a uniform description of Cloud services would be needed. The aim of this study is to provide a new ontology for uniform description of Cloud services coming from heterogeneous sources. The proposed model takes into account the different relationships and dependencies between services across Cloud's layers. These dependencies are represented by the different constraints of composition and deployment. To validate our proposal, qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted. The qualitative evaluation is carried out by making comparisons with both state-of-the-art works and the Bitnami platform according to some criteria. For the quantitative evaluation, comparisons are performed with the output results specified by users. Globally, the results are promising and encouraging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is different from distributed computing and grid computing and has its own characteristics. The existing cloud system is not sufficient in the unified identification of cloud resources and the dynamic joining management of new resources. According to the characteristics of cloud computing, this paper introduces the idea of ontology on cloud monitor system (CMS) based on bionic autonomic nervous system (BANS) and uses ontology web language (OWL) language to describe the resources of the system. It also establishes a reusable extended resource expression model. At the same time, the use of the third-party tool Jena for OWL semantic query also gives the monitoring system the characteristics of a rapid semantic query, which further enhances the convenience of cloud resource management. In addition, based on the application of ontology, we also introduce multivariate decision diagram (MDD) multi-valued decision graph technology, which allows B-CMS to self-diagnose complex system faults. The combination of ontology and MDD greatly simplifies the monitoring and management of large-scale systems, providing a fast and standardized means for the intelligent diagnosis of systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional searchable encryption schemes mostly adopt the TF-IDF (term frequency - inverse document frequency) model which ignores the semantic association between keywords and documents. It is a challenge to design an effective and secure semantic-aware search scheme. The topic model is based on “high-order co-occurrence”, i.e., how often words co-occur in different contexts. Hence, it can be utilized for modeling the latent semantics among texts. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-persevering searchable encryption scheme based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. Documents are modeled by LDA, and the concept of topics is utilized to generate a document-topic relevance matrix and query topic vectors. The matrix is used as the index for the proposed scheme. The secure inner product operation is adopted to encrypt the index and query topic vectors, which provides accurate topic relevance score calculation between encrypted index and trapdoors. To improve the efficiency of our basic scheme, we adopt a special complete binary tree and use the “Greedy Depth First Search” algorithm. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Land cover change (LCC) detection is widely used in many social-benefit areas, such as land cover updating, sustainable development and geographical situation monitoring. With the development of Web Services and cloud computing, a number of remote sensed algorithms and models have been published as web services. An on-demand service is urgent to be generated by compositing a sequence of atomic services, according to different situations. Context information plays an important role in automatic service composition. Traditional context information models mainly focus on service only, and ignore the relationships among users and services. To address this problem, we introduce the service context and user context into the context information. OWL-SC and OWL-UC are then proposed by extending the traditional service description model (i.e., OWL-S). Finally, a context-aware on-demand service model for LCC detection is built to realize service composition and optimization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has emerged as real world technology over the Internet. Due to the development of big data with high dimensionality, data storage possibility over cloud has created large scope in recent times. Document clustering is the fundamental topic that turned into an indispensable component in many areas like cloud computing. Document clustering partitions the document into significant classes or groups for retrieving the relevant document. Many researchers used the factorization methods and ontologies for internal and external knowledge based document clustering. However, existing methods failed to provide the semantic feature construction and leads to the information loss while covering all the ideas in documents. In order to address these problems, different document clustering techniques in cloud has been reviewed in this paper. In addition to that Document clustering by Entropy-based Boosting with Projection Neural Feature (EB-PNF) method is presented. The proposed method involves two stages. They are, similar document identification based on semantic similarity score, feature extraction which includes the extraction of both single and multi-label features based on the precision, recall and computational complexity to prove that EB-PNF method produces high-quality clusters comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The technique of association rules is very useful in Data Mining, but it generates a huge number of rules. So, a manual post-processing is required to target only the interesting rules. Several researchers suggest integrating users' knowledge by using ontology and rule patterns, and then select automatically the interesting rules after generating all possible rules. However, nowadays the business data are extremely increasing, and many companies have already opted for Big Data systems deployed in cloud environments, then the process of generating association rules becomes very hard. To deal with this issue, we propose an approach using ontology with rule patterns to integrate users' knowledge early in the preprocessing step before searching or generating any rule. So, only the interesting rules which respect the rule patterns will be generated. This approach allows reducing execution time and minimizing the cost of the post-processing especially for Big Data. To confirm the performance results, experiments are carried out on Not Only Strutured Query Language (NoSQL) databases which are distributed in a cloud environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Utilizing advanced information technology to identify the intellectual structure of patents is important for the fast-emerging cloud computing industry; however, related literature is limited. Because the existing three categories of cloud computing business mode are partially overlapped, the customary SPI model as a basis for patent analysis is unable to grasp the development status of cloud computing correctly. The aims of this study are to obtain clustering of cloud patent with overlapping claims and to identify the intellectual structure of different research themes in the development of cloud computing. This study first proposes an ontology-based compound retrieval policy to retrieve three non-overlapped cloud patents. We then propose a new overlapping cluster algorithm using the patents with the highest degree centralities as the initial central points for clustering, and utilizing the Taguchi and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution methods for integrating the clustering quality-related indices. Based on the database of the three overlapped clusters of cloud computing patents, we propose a group technology-based co-word analysis, incorporating with the visual methods of social network analysis and multivariate analysis, to investigate the R&D themes in each service mode of cloud computing. Based on the analysis results, technologies related to computer-readable storage medium and computer program are of particular interest to the SaaS enterprises. The virtual machine technologies are the major development directions of PaaS enterprises, and virtual computing environment has gained many attentions from the IaaS enterprises. The proposed method for exploring the intellectual structure, as well as the analyzed results for unveiling the development status of cloud computing and the co-opetition relationship between companies, can provide valuable references for cloud-related companies to make their R&D management strategy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud service searching technique is used to find relevant information on World Wide Web. Each search engine maintains following process in real time environment like web crawling, web scrapping, indexing and searching. The search engine over cloud is specially designed for cloud service discovery. This search engine mainly concentrates on discovering appropriate cloud services in effective and efficient manner. We proposed a technique named as Cognizant Clustering Algorithm that group service entries based on cloud user requirements that include functional, technical and cost specification. This search engine uses a similarity ontology that provides interrelationships between service entries. The similarity ontology has three kind of operation over cloud that includes perception, object entity and data type similarity reasoning. It uses Cognizant clustering matrix to calculate the number of service entries, distance and utilization per request. It improves the search result more effective and significantly increases the performance in service discovery over cloud environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Objectives: This study proposes functional requirements and an architectural reference model of Semantic Library, recognized as a prototype of nextgeneration library information systems. Methods/Statistical analysis: Semantic Library can realize semantic interoperability and integration based on ontology and metadata, and also renovate information services for users with openness, sharing, participation and collaboration. Semantic Library will be effectively implemented by means of service-oriented architecture and the logical structure of FRBR. In this study, a reference model of Semantic Library at cloud computing environment emerging is presented as a next-generation model of library information systems. Findings: The LOD form evolves into an open library framework, and the detailed technology can be categorized into six categories. First is LOD converting technology, which can publish structured database like non-structured data into RDF triples by rule-based mechanism. Second is to develop an ontology language to specify LOD data at web service and distributed processing system, and is about technology for registering LOD information resources which is possible to register LOD specification. Third is LOD data retrieving parts for LOD data set and semantic retrieving system which are used to search ontology, semantic web and semantic retrieving field. Fourth is knowledge service specification and registration enabled field. Fifth is about discovery of semantic based knowledge service used for semantic based matching system which discovers most optimized services to coup with user requirements and service profile for ontology, semantic web and inferences. Six is LOD based service development parts, which is an integrated development environment (IDE). Improvements/Applications: This study combines libraries, information technology, and nextgeneration Internet technologies, including the concept of semantic libraries and functional requirements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, searchable encryption is a hot topic in the field of cloud computing. The existing achievements are mainly focused on keyword-based search schemes, and almost all of them depend on predefined keywords extracted in the phases of index construction and query. However, keyword-based search schemes ignore the semantic representation information of users' retrieval and cannot completely match users' search intention. Therefore, how to design a content-based search scheme and make semantic search more effective and context-aware is a difficult challenge. In this paper, for the first time, we define and solve the problems of semantic search based on conceptual graphs (CGs) over encrypted outsourced data in clouding computing (SSCG). We first employ the efficient measure of sentence scoring in text summarization and Tregex to extract the most important and simplified topic sentences from documents. We then convert these simplified sentences into CGs. To perform quantitative calculation of CGs, we design a new method that can map CGs to vectors. Next, we rank the returned results based on text summarization score. Furthermore, we propose a basic idea for SSCG and give a significantly improved scheme to satisfy the security guarantee of searchable symmetric encryption (SSE). Finally, we choose a real-world dataset, i.e., the CNN dataset to test our scheme. The results obtained from the experiment show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid spread of services in the Cloud computing environment, it is difficult for users to find the right service. Therefore, the necessity of a search engine with semantic focused crawler becomes a fundamental requirement. However, the huge size and varied functionalities of Cloud services on the Web, together with the lack of standardized and coherent description of services available, have a great effect for crawlers in order to provide effective Cloud services. To solve these issues, we propose a Cloud service discovery crawler that employs a two-level semantic similarity measure based on both TF-IDF and LDA models. Moreover, in order to automatically discover and categorize Cloud services, we present a Cloud Service Ontology (CSOnt) that contains a set of concepts defining Cloud service categories. Experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the performance of the focused crawlers and presents an efficient way to parse the Web and collect Web pages relevant to Cloud services. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) web services plays important role. Web services are web application components that can be published, found, and used on the Web. Also machine-to-machine communication over a network can be achieved through web services. Cloud computing and distributed computing brings lot of web services into WWW. Web service composition is the process of combing two or more web services to together to satisfy the user requirements. Tremendous increase in the number of services and the complexity in user requirement specification make web service composition as challenging task. The automated service composition is a technique in which Web Service Composition can be done automatically with minimal or no human intervention. In this paper we propose a approach of web service composition methods for large scale environment by considering the QoS Parameters. We have used stacked autoencoders to learn features of web services. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) leverages uses the learned features to predict the new composition. Experiment results show the efficiency and scalability. Use of deep learning algorithm in web service composition, leads to �high success rate and less computational cost. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The maintenance of historic buildings requires a systematic approach to construct and reuse maintenance knowledge. Maintenance knowledge of historic buildings has extensive and specific knowledge, but a small number of experts provide most of experience. With the rapid development of building information modelling (BIM), it can facilitate maintenance management of historic buildings. Recently, research on connecting ontology and BIM was discussed to promote building knowledge management (BKM). However, BKM is less applied in historic buildings and connection strength is also less discussed. Connection strength of knowledge mapping can increase the performance of knowledge retrieval. Therefore, this study aims to build connection between maintenance ontology of historic buildings and BIM, and also proposes a cloud model-based knowledge mapping method to evaluate the connection strength. This study uses FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis) to connect ontology and BIM, and the grey relational analysis to evaluate the connection strength. Meanwhile, cloud model is integrated into FMEA to better deal with uncertain information to increase the reliability. This study adopts a real case to valid the practicability. The results show the proposed method can evaluate the connection strengths with uncertain information and obtain the maintenance knowledge more efficiently. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A code snippet is a small region of reusable source code that is common to many functions. Skilled management and reuse of snippets can improve programming efficiency in practice. However, we find that most snippets are posted to online blogs or snippet management systems with little description and tagging, which leads to an embarrassing situation in which existing snippets are difficult to reuse. This occurs because snippets are usually hastily pushed to online services or saved in text files by programmers and also because existing management systems do not provide efficient labeling and reusing frameworks. In this paper, we propose to annotate snippets with a well-formed domain-specific ontology—programming ontology. With a thorough investigation of real world snippets, we designed a programming ontology to annotate and recommend snippets. We show how to annotate a snippet with ontology terms based on text classification models. In addition, we built a snippet management system that stores user snippets in the cloud and automatically recommends snippets, so that the retrieval of snippets becomes trivial in popular integrated developing environments, such as Eclipse and Visual Studio. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the ontology annotation algorithm is able to automatically annotate a snippet with a high degree of accuracy. The shared domain knowledge also makes it possible to share snippets among programmers and systems. As the number of labeled snippets increases, deep learning models can be trained and used to annotate code snippets with high accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Various classifications have been proposed to describe and organize the cloud security landscape. While some are inherited from general security concepts like security attributes (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), others are based on cloud specific characteristics such as cloud service models and stakeholders' roles. Despite the extensive body of research on developing classifications for cloud computing security, a study on the principles and dimensions of these classifications have largely escaped rigorous analysis. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing cloud computing security classifications, taxonomies, and ontologies. We explore their strengths, limitations, and effective use in an attempt to draw the general properties for a holistic framework that can provide a comprehensive view of cloud computing security and help better understand this evolving field. Researchers may find in this paper a road map and an overview of what exists in terms of cloud security classifications, taxonomies, and ontologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid adoption of Cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, health providers are particularly concerned about managing data privacy on the cloud. Existing approaches have either a scalability bottleneck by requiring that patients approve each sharing of their medical data or a trust bottleneck by having a single authority control every access thereby creating the problem of a single point of attack. To address both these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that enables policy based multi-authority access authorization to EHR systems accessed by multiple care providers from different locations or organizations. This framework, which resides on the Edge, has been built using the Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA-ABE) and Semantic Web technologies to provide a secure, semantically rich approach to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations who manage different attributes of end users using a shared dataset. In this paper, we describe our novel approach along with the proof of concept prototype that we created to evaluate our framework. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Fourth Industrial Revolution can be known as Industry 4.0 which are most often associated with industrial development as well as high-tech strategies in the year 2011 at Germany. It considered as a combination with the many technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, linked data, 3D printing, biotechnology and the integration of technology with the human body in industrial operations. Challenges are not limited to the financial investments required for the acquisition of new technologies for Industrial Revolution 4.0 but also in relation to the availability of qualified personnel at all levels of the organization that are able to cope with the increasing complexity of the future production system. Thus the organization should have identify the qualified candidates that suitable for the company in future. Most of the previous studies has shown and more focused on the readiness among graduate students are needed to overcome the new technology. In addition, there are no significant statistical outcomes stated about the factors influence the readiness of students on industrial revolution 4.0. This quantitative research aimed to identify the factors that influence the readiness of the undergraduate’s students of Universiti Tun Hussein Onn (UTHM) towards industrial revolution 4.0. Quantitative research method is practiced in this research. 5 point Likert scale has been used in the questionnaire to collect the data. The research sample is composed of 200 students from final year student of FPTP. Results of the research show that there is no relationship between the technical skills and non-technical skills of the student’s readiness towards Industrial Revolution 4.0. Moreover, implications of the findings, suggestions for future studies and recommendations for proactive implementation and action to be taken by future researcher also presented. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: In recent years, governments around the world are actively promoting the Open Government Data (OGD) to facilitate reusing open data and developing information applications. Currently, there are more than 35,000 data sets available on the Taiwan OGD website. However, the existing Taiwan OGD website only provides keyword queries and lacks a friendly query interface. This study aims to address these issues by defining a DBpedia cloud computing framework (DCCF) for integrating DBpedia with Semantic Web technologies into Spark cluster cloud computing environment. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed DCCF is used to develop a Taiwan OGD recommendation platform (TOGDRP) that provides a friendly query interface to automatically filter out the relevant data sets and visualize relationships between these data sets. Findings: To demonstrate the feasibility of TOGDRP, the experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the different cloud computing models, including Hadoop YARN cluster model, Spark standalone cluster model and Spark YARN cluster model. Originality/value: The novel solution proposed in this study is a hybrid approach for integrating Semantic Web technologies into Hadoop and Spark cloud computing environment to provide OGD data sets recommendation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract With the development of information technologies, IT convergence technologies are being utilized in various fields. Human-oriented contents are continuously being developed to enjoy higher quality life through IT convergence technologies. Health care services resulting from the development of various smart IT devices in the health and medical field make more efficient health management possible for people. This study proposes a cloud-based ontology context mining method using deep-learning in health care. The user’s static data and context data are saved in cloud, which is a high performance computing resource through ontology modeling and context mining is used to collect user health data with high similarity. The collected health data are applied to the algorithms and back propagation of artificial neural networks and deep-learning is conducted to provide more accurate health care prediction service. Furthermore, upon conducting a performance analysis to verify the validity of the learned user health data, it was found that the prediction accuracy that applied the proposed method was approximately 17% higher. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has pulled in numerous business organizations and users because of its simplified administration effort, minimal maintenance cost and pervasive access to out-sourced resources, which can be hardware or software. Users share these resources in large-scale environments over the Internet. Stringent access control must be implemented in a cloud storage system for protecting sensitive information. Access control models in the current literature such as Discretionary Access control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control model (MAC), Role-Based Access Model (RBAC) or Attribute Access Control Model (ABAC) consider the entities of access control in isolation and thus leading to incorrect access control decisions. In this paper, Ontology-Based Access Control is proposed. This proposal uses an ontology to model the entities associated with access control and their interrelationships among them, which could be effortlessly adjusted to Cloud environments. Ontology promises to streamline knowledge sharing among the entities. Subsumption property is exploited over concepts, properties and individuals. The experimental results show that the number of rules to be stored in Policy Base is reduced and reasoning time is also considerably reduced because of applying subsumption property and hence access decision is made faster. Also, our work is compared with the existing works against the state of art models with the help of access control metrics provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Our work answers the queries related to metric effectively than the existing works. Hence the performance of the system is increased and suitable for securing cloud data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Governmental and local authorities are facing many new information and communication technologies challenges. The amount of data is rapidly increasing. The data sets are published in different formats. New services are based on linking and processing differently structured data from various sources. Users expect openness of public data, fast processing, and intuitive visualisation. The article addresses the challenges and proposes a new government enterprise architecture framework. The following partial architectures are included: big and open linked data storage, processing, and publishing using cloud computing. At first, the key concepts are defined. Next, the basic architectural roles and components are specified. The components result from the decomposition of related frameworks. The main part of the article deals with the detailed proposal of the architecture framework and partial views on architecture (sub-architectures). A methodology, including a proposal of appropriate steps, solutions and responsibilities for them, is described in the next step - after the verification and validation of the new framework with respect to the attributes of quality. The new framework responds to emerging ICT trends in order to evolve government enterprise architecture continually and represent current architectural components and their relationships. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Contemporary mobile devices are the result of an evolution process, during which computational and networking capabilities have been continuously pushed to keep pace with the constantly growing workload requirements. This has allowed devices such as smartphones, tablets, and personal digital assistants to perform increasingly complex tasks, up to the point of efficiently replacing traditional options such as desktop computers and notebooks. However, due to their portability and size, these devices are more prone to theft, to become compromised, or to be exploited for attacks and other malicious activity. The need for investigation of the aforementioned incidents resulted in the creation of the Mobile Forensics (MF) discipline. MF, a sub-domain of digital forensics, is specialized in extracting and processing evidence from mobile devices in such a way that attacking entities and actions are identified and traced. Beyond its primary research interest on evidence acquisition from mobile devices, MF has recently expanded its scope to encompass the organized and advanced evidence representation and analysis of future malicious entity behavior. Nonetheless, data acquisition still remains its main focus. While the field is under continuous research activity, new concepts such as the involvement of cloud computing in the MF ecosystem and the evolution of enterprise mobile solutions-particularly mobile device management and bring your own device-bring new opportunities and issues to the discipline. The current article presents the research conducted within the MF ecosystem during the last 7 years, identifies the gaps, and highlights the differences from past research directions, and addresses challenges and open issues in the field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - After a comparative evaluation around the concepts of Industry 4.0, Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming, the paper discusses the necessity of identifying solutions able to apply the methods of the so-called Knowledge Management 4.0 in the agri-environmental enterprises. To this aim, an ontology based on a conceptual map derived from the data-to-information transformation is here proposed to support the design of a new generation of Farm Information Systems (FIS) able to fit the production needs of agri-environmental enterprises. The data-to-information cycle is split into four phases: A) Data collection, B) Data processing, C) Data analysis and evaluation, and D) Use of information. Phases A and D comprise tools of "light digitization" typically referring to OLTP components (On Line Transactional Processes). On their turn, phases B and C are typically formed by "heavy digitization" components (On Line Analytical Processes), generally more complicated to be managed by the farmers directly. The conceptual map defined by the ontology is firstly useful to plan the composition of the FIS according to a modular approach, possibly following a strategy that starts to consider the introduction of OLTP components, for then evolving gradually towards more articulated solutions that include also OLAP component and related functions. In this way, decision makers can manage practical planning instrument able to show clearly the level of complexity a FIS can reach, thus evaluating its sustainability with respect to the financial, cultural and professional resources available at the farm. Finally, after having underlined the opportunities offered by Cloud Computing and widespread connectivity, that provide an easier adoption of OLAP tools, some application cases are presented and discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Toward industry 4.0, modern manufacturing companies are aiming at building digital twins to manage physical assets, processes, people, and places. Since in this environment, massive amounts of data have been generated and collected, integration and management of various data sources is of paramount importance. In this context, cloud computing as a crucial part of Industry 4.0 facilitates distribution of computer resources without direct active management by users. Accordingly, an ontology enables efficient integration and management of data as a reference data model through representation of knowledge. Besides, data mining from massive data is very important to identify significant meaning of data, and to avoid unexpected errors through predictions from experiences described in data replica. This research addresses problems towards efficient integration and management of data for predictive maintenance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Multi-user multi-keyword ranked search scheme in arbitrary language is a novel multi-keyword rank searchable encryption (MRSE) framework based on Paillier Cryptosystem with Threshold Decryption (PCTD). Compared to previous MRSE schemes constructed based on the k-nearest neighbor searchable encryption (KNN-SE) algorithm, it can mitigate some drawbacks and achieve better performance in terms of functionality and efficiency. Additionally, it does not require a predefined keyword set and support keywords in arbitrary languages. However, due to the pattern of exact matching of keywords in the new MRSE scheme, multilingual search is limited to each language and cannot be searched across languages. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual multi-keyword rank search (CLRSE) scheme which eliminates the barrier of languages and achieves semantic extension with using the Open Multilingual Wordnet. Our CLRSE scheme also realizes intelligent and personalized search through flexible keyword and language preference settings. We evaluate the performance of our scheme in terms of security, functionality, precision and efficiency, via extensive experiments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Information retrieval system completely happened through keyword searching and it compromises with a very large search space as documents to be searched can be of any length and thus time to search in a whole document is also proportional to length of documents i.e. number of words in all documents. By shortening this large search space search time can also be lessening. Searching of data relevant to our query is done by information retrieval system. Keyword searching is the basic idea of this system which tries to solve the large search space problem as the documents to be searched could be of any length. This means time to search will increase with length of document. Search time will be reduced by reducing the search space. In this,we are constructing a method which reduces the searching areawith the help of indexing that takes the help of stemming methodand knowledge of stopwords. Representation of both, a word andmore than one word are done by creating Indices using singleconcept. The recall is improved by including domain knowledgeusing ontology while searching.. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the emerging technologies, seeking significant attention in the research area is cloud computing. However, privacy is the major concern in the cloud, as it is essential to manage the confidentiality in the data shared. In the first work, the privacy preservation model was developed by newly designed Kronecker product based Bat algorithm. Here, the previous work is extended by developing the classification algorithm for classifying the privacy preserved database. Initially, the Kronecker product based Bat algorithm finds the privacy preserved database from the original medical data. Then, the ontology based features are extracted from the privacy preserved database and given to the data classifier. Here, a classifier, named Whale based Sine Cosine Algorithm with Support Vector Neural Network (WSCA-SVNN), is newly developed for the data classification. The proposed WSCA algorithm helps in optimally choosing the weights for SVNN classifier, and finally, the WSCA-SVNN classifier classifies the medical data. The simulation of the proposed privacy preserved data classification network is done by utilizing the heart disease database. The analysis shows that the proposed WSCA-SVNN classifier scheme achieved an accuracy value of 90.29% during medical data classification. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Semantic relatedness between context information of two different entities, which are one of the most easily accessible features, have been shown to be very useful for detecting the semantic relations held in the text segments. However, these semantic relatedness information is often ignored by some researcher in the study of the problem of relation extraction. In this work, we propose a novel neural network for semantic relation extraction called entity-dependent long short-term memory network (ED-LSTM). This network can extract the relatedness of entity with the context, and select the relevant parts of contexts to infer the semantic relation towards the entity. We do some experiments on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset. Extensive experiment and the results demonstrate that the proposed methods are effective for relation extraction, which can obtain state-of-the-art F1 result just with minimal feature engineering. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, a large amount of user privacy-sensitive data is outsourced to the cloud server in ciphertext, which is provided by the data owners and can be accessed by authorized data users. When accessing data, the user should be assigned with the access permission according to his identities or attributes. In addition, the search capabilities in encrypted out-sourced data is expected to be enhanced, i.e., the search results can better present user's intentions. To address the above issues, ESAS, an Efficient Semantic and Authorized Search scheme over encrypted outsourced data, is proposed. In ESAS, by integrating PRSCG (the privacy-preserving ranked search based on conceptual graph) and CP-ABE (ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption), semantic search with file-level fine-grained access authorization can be realized. In addition, search authorization can be done in an offline manner, which can improve search efficiency and reduce the response time. The security analysis indicate that the proposed ESAS meets security requirement. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing technology offers on-demand access to different cloud services over the Internet. The huge number of cloud providers that offer various services with different descriptions caused many problems, such as the complexity of multi-cloud service discovery and taking a lot of time to find candidates services that meets user's requirements. In this paper, we propose a new approach for composite infrastructure service discovery in multi-cloud environment. In our approach, we propose an indexing technique to facilitate virtual cloud resource discovery and their matching to user requirements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep neural networks can obtain effective hierarchical representations, which make them perform well in image recognition and speech recognition. However, the disadvantages of deep learning relying on large-scale annotation data also limit its development. To this end, a multi-layer convolutional neural network based on knowledge graph prior knowledge is proposed in this paper, which acquires text features from finer granularity, and using the existing prior knowledge which increases granularity information to enhance the semantic information of the text, and to reduce the dependence of the model on large-scale samples. At the same time, it can reduce the over-fitting problem of the model, and improve classification accuracy. This model performs well in several large data sets. By introducing prior knowledge to TextCNN, a classical deep neural model, it has also verified the validity of using prior knowledge through experiments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The description of model is the important foundation of realizing cloud computing-based simulation. Current description methods of simulation model resources have difficulty supporting search and discovery of simulation model in cloud architecture environment. So this article proposes a description method of cloud simulation model resources based on knowledge graph, concluding the information that cloud simulation model resources description is needed, and transforms the information into four different RDF triples to construct knowledge graphs for describing cloud simulation model resources. Taking the descriptions of three aircraft models as case study, this article tests the function of search and discovery of simulation model for the specific needs of users on the knowledge graph constructed from the case to prove the availability and effectiveness of this method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Many enterprises consider that cloud computing will continue to play a key role due to its ability to deliver various types of on-demand IT services, and according to customer needs. Although cloud technology has characteristics that distinguish it from other technologies, unfortunately, services in this technology suffer from the heterogeneity issue. As a result, cloud services have many challenges, such as service description, interoperability, and service discovery. Many studies have contributed dealing with such challenges using ontology, as it can participate as a mapping layer to present such services in a unified description. Cloud ontologies included in these studies can be classified into three types of ontologies; ontologies that focus on representing functional features of cloud services, ontologies that focus on non-functional features, and ontologies that focus on both function and non-function features. These ontologies are not unified in representing such features, where they agree in some features and differ in others. By using techniques developed to evaluate ontologies related to the other technologies, it is difficult to decide which cloud ontology captures cloud services in the right way. We have noticed that there is not a framework or a benchmark to evaluate the cloud ontologies. In this survey, the current cloud ontologies are analyzed to identify a set of observations that represent their strengths and weaknesses. According to these observations, a set of suggested rules are introduced and verified to be considered during the construction or the evaluation of cloud ontologies. The work in this paper can be considered as the fundamental step for developing a formal framework to automatically evaluate cloud ontologies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Cloud computing provides a dynamic, heterogeneous and elastic environment by offering accessible ‘cloud services’ to end-users. The tasks involved in making cloud services available, such as matchmaking, selection and composition, are essential and closely related to each other. Integration of these tasks is critical for optimal composition and performance of the cloud service platform. More efficient solutions could be developed by considering cloud service tasks collectively, but the research and academic community have so far only considered these tasks individually. The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated QoS-based approach for cloud service matchmaking, selection and composition using the Semantic Web. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a new approach using the Semantic Web and quality of service (QoS) model to perform cloud service matchmaking, selection and composition, to fulfil the requirements of an end user. In the Semantic Web, the authors develop cloud ontologies to provide semantic descriptions to the service provider and requester, so as to automate the cloud service tasks. This paper considers QoS parameters, such as availability, throughput, response time and cost, for quality assurance and enhanced user satisfaction. Findings: This paper focus on the development of an integrated framework and approach for cloud service life cycle phases, such as discovery, selection and composition using QoS, to enhance user satisfaction and the Semantic Web, to achieve automation. To evaluate performance and usefulness, this paper uses a scenario based on a Healthcare Decision-Making System (HDMS). Results derived through the experiment prove that the proposed prototype performs well for the defined set of cloud-services tasks. Originality/value: As a novel concept, our proposed integrated framework and approach for cloud service matchmaking, selection and composition based on the Semantic Web and QoS characterisitcs (availability, response time, throughput and cost), as part of the service level agreement (SLA) will help the end user to match, select and filter cloud services and integrate cloud-service providers into a multi-cloud environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing enables the use of computing resources through the web, which is delivered as software, platform and infrastructure services. With increasing demand and adoption of cloud services, cloud service user faces many issues on selecting a particular service. In this paper, we provide a system, OSSR-P, which search and rank the platform as a service type services according to user requirements. OSSR-P system is based on PaaS service ontology which is developed and populated by parsing the service description document and WSDL document of PaaS services. The user requirements are parsed and generated as SPARQL queries which then retrieve the service list from the ontology repository. The retrieved services are ranked according to the requirements matching. The performance evaluation of OSSR-P shows that it provides and maintains consistent results irrespective of the number of requirements given by the user. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: Open standards are urgently needed for enabling software interoperability in Cloud Computing. Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) provides a set of best design principles to create interoperable REST management APIs. Although OCCI is the only standard addressing the management of any kind of cloud resources, it does not support a range of best principles related to REST design. This often worsens REST API quality by decreasing their understandability and reusability. Objective: We aim at assisting cloud developers to enhance their REST management APIs by providing a compliance evaluation of OCCI and REST best principles and a recommendation support to comply with these principles. Method: First, we leverage patterns and anti-patterns to drive respectively the good and poor practices of OCCI and REST best principles. Then, we propose a semantic-based approach for defining and detecting REST and OCCI (anti)patterns and providing a set of correction recommendations to comply with both REST and OCCI best principles. We validated this approach by applying it on cloud REST APIs and evaluating its accuracy, usefulness and extensibility. Results: We found that our approach accurately detects OCCI and REST(anti)patterns and provides useful recommendations. According to the compliance results, we reveal that there is no widespread adoption of OCCI principles in existing APIs. In contrast, these APIs have reached an acceptable level of maturity regarding REST principles. Conclusion: Our approach provides an effective and extensible technique for defining and detecting OCCI and REST (anti)patterns in Cloud REST APIs. Cloud software developers can benefit from our approach and defined principles to accurately evaluate their APIs from OCCI and REST perspectives. This contributes in designing interoperable, understandable, and reusable Cloud management APIs. Thank to the compliance analysis and the recommendation support, we also contribute to improving these APIs, which make them more straightforward. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The problem of public auditing has been well studied in many research articles. The methods described earlier suffer to achieve higher result in public auditing. To overcome the challenges in public auditing, the author propose a hierarchical attribute based encryption based modular padding scheme. The method organizes the cloud data in hierarchical manner and each level of attributes has been stored in semantic manner. The semantic relations of the attributes are used to select the key parameter and the same is used to encrypt or decrypt the cloud data. The semantic ontology maintains the category of data attributes and for each data attribute the ontology refers a secret key. The key from the semantic ontology is selected and the same is used to perform verification. Again the encrypted data is performed with modular padding, which selects the random number and based on the value of random number, a padding of 1 or 0 is performed. The proposed approach improves the performance of public auditing and security in cloud environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is an information technology paradigm enabling companies to sell computing resources more dynamically. Software and hardware are now commodities leased on demand. Because computer systems leased from a cloud service provider, virtual machines, are typically connected to internet, they can host web services, which are frequently components of service oriented architectures (SOAs). Such architectures have recently been adopted in factory automation, as they allow systems to reach high levels of decentralization and loose-coupling. SOA-based Factory automation systems combine physical production equipment with web services that belong to the information processing (cyber) domain, and they are therefore highly cyber-physical. When some of the services are deployed on cloud resources, SOA-based factory automation systems can be classified cloud-based cyber-physical systems. Each service in such a system is typically able to perform rather simple, atomic operations, whereas achievement of complex goals requires that the services be composed to collaboratively carry out workflows. This article investigates the use of cloud resources in automatic service workflow composition. To facilitate the acquisition and utilization of cloud resources, a system of two specialized web services is proposed. The system includes a web service that dynamically deploys virtual machines to carry out planning processes, thereby exhibiting artificial intelligence. Finally, this paper demonstrates the integration of the system with a previously proposed semantic web service composition framework. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Distributed computer integrated manufacturing is increasingly adopting cloud computing, software-as-a-service (SaaS) and multi-agent systems as steps towards “design anywhere, build anywhere” strategy. In this scenario, ontologies not only serve as common message exchange structure among distributed agents but also provide reasoning capability to extract implicit knowledge from explicit information already stored in the knowledge base. Foundation ontologies (upper-level), comprised of most general concepts of a domain, provide a common semantic structure to the domain-level ontologies, which capture details of multi-disciplinary manufacturing knowledge. In this paper, novel upper-level ontology, called SIMPM (Semantically Integrated Manufacturing Planning Model), is proposed in order to model three fundamental constraints of manufacturing process planning: variety, time, and aggregation. The philosophical underpinning of the proposed ontology – presented as OWL-DL axioms – is derived from a three dimensional planning model, developed during our past research on computer-aided process planning. As part of the evaluation of SIMPM ontology, we first expound on the interoperability issues with other upper-level manufacturing ontologies. Next, we present a case study on process planning for prismatic part design. In this way, we demonstrate how the generic set of proposed axioms may be used to address various manufacturing process planning concerns, such as alternative manufacturing resources, the temporal order among operations and granularity in the details of a process plan. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Open data strategies are being adopted in disaster-related data particularly because of the need to provide information on global targets and indicators for implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030. In all phases of disaster risk management including forecasting, emergency response and post-disaster reconstruction, the need for interconnected multidisciplinary open data for collaborative reporting as well as study and analysis are apparent, in order to determine disaster impact data in timely and reportable manner. The extraordinary progress in computing and information technology in the past decade, such as broad local and wide-area network connectivity (e.g. Internet), high-performance computing, service and cloud computing, big data methods and mobile devices, provides the technical foundation for connecting open data to support disaster risk research. A new generation of disaster data infrastructure based on interconnected open data is evolving rapidly. There are two levels in the conceptual model of Linked Open Data for Global Disaster Risk Research (LODGD) Working Group of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA), which is the Committee on Data of the International Council for Science (ICSU): data characterization and data connection. In data characterization, the knowledge about disaster taxonomy and data dependency on disaster events requires specific scientific study as it aims to understand and present the correlation between specific disaster events and scientific data through the integration of literature analysis and semantic knowledge discovery. Data connection concepts deal with technical methods to connect distributed data resources identified by data characterization of disaster type. In the science community, interconnected open data for disaster risk impact assessment are beginning to influence how disaster data are shared, and this will need to extend data coverage and provide better ways of utilizing data across domains where innovation and integration are now necessarily needed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing involves multiple stakeholders, each with its own security, privacy and trust requirements, where policy enforcement is shared between the various stakeholders, in contrast to on-premise computing, where an organizations policies are enforced using internal resources. To effectively manage and integrate security requirements in the cloud, the provider and customer needs to negotiate and agree upon the applied security policies. However, there is no standard way of expressing cloud security policies in a vendor-agnostic manner. Cloud security and privacy policies are often stated in an informal and ad-hoc manner, which leads to policy conflicts, incompleteness, ambiguity and inconsistencies. In this paper, we present CERBERUS, a framework for representing cloud security and privacy policies and detecting potential problems in the policies. CERBERUS adopts an object-oriented approach and consists of an ontology and notation, policies, guidelines and rules, and a tool for capturing and detecting policy errors. Using CERBERUS, policies can be analyzed for potential problems, including policy conflicts, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness. An application of CERBERUS shows that it indeed helps to discover policy errors, which otherwise would go undetected or in many cases would be detected a posteriori at runtime. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The technologies of knowledge representation and inference in an artificial intelligence system focused on the domain of nuclear physics and nuclear power engineering are considered. The possibilities of description logics and graph databases of nuclear knowledge for the generation of cognitive hypotheses, using in addition to deduction and other ways of reasoning, such as inductive inference and reasoning based on analogies, are discussed. The use of adequate description logic and measures of semantic similarity is substantiated. Interactive visual navigation and reasoning on the knowledge graphs are performed by means of special retrieval widgets and the smart RDF browser. Operations with semantic repositories are implemented on cloud platforms using SPARQL queries and RESTful services. The proposed software solutions are based on cloud computing using DBaaS and PaaS service models to ensure scalability of data warehouses and network services. Example of use of the offered technologies and software has been given. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the emergence of cloud computing, building and developing a new Software by SaaS composition becomes a major concern in today's cloud business. First, the business analyst establishes the Business Process (BP) of the new SaaS. Then, the SaaS composer, based on functional and non-functional requirements, discovers and selects the potential SaaS components that can fill into each of the defined tasks in the BP. Currently, enterprises need more and more flexible SaaS business process as an adaptive composite SaaS from process vendors, which interest on context changes and needs evolutions. A meta-model is proposed in this paper dealing with different concepts involved in business cloud layer. This meta-model, in which both business process and service composition are considered, is accompanied by a case study. Then, an ontology has been developed and an extract of instances has been presented to demonstrate the adaptation process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional searchable encryption schemes adopting the bag-of-words model occupy massive space to store the document set's index, where the dimension of the document vector is equal to the scale of the dictionary. The bag-of-words model also ignores the semantic information between keywords and documents, which could return non-relevant search results to users. The neutral-network based natural language processing method - Doc2Vec model use word's and paragraph's context information to extract documents' features. The features contain latent semantics information and can measure the similarity between documents. In this paper, we adopt the Doc2Vec model to achieve a semantic-aware multikeyword ranked search scheme. Doc2Vec model uses the distributed representation of words and documents with a modest dimensionality of vectors while trained on a dataset with a few hundred of millions of words. Documents' distributed representations are extracted as documents feature vector by Doc2Vec model and utilized as the search index. The features of the queried keywords are also extracted as the query feature vector, and the secure inner product operation is adopted to achieve privacy-preserving semantic search with the query feature vector and index. Our scheme can support dynamic update on the document set with Doc2Vec model. The experiment on a real-world dataset shows that the fixed-length feature vector can improve the time and space efficiency on the semantic-aware search. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data as a Service (DaaS) is seen as a promising cloud offering for wrangling the overload of information and making it available across cloud platforms anytime and anywhere. While there exist a large number of DaaS providers in the market, each one has a different way to describe its provided services as well as supplied datasets. The lack of a well-defined machine-readable model strongly hinders the automatic selection and composition of DaaSs. This paper presents MoDaaS, a model-driven framework for the modeling and the description of DaaS services. MoDaaS enables DaaS providers to describe their services capabilities and concerns according to a shared ontology, thereafter it enables them to automatically generate service views in order to assist the integration and data exchange between heterogeneous services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Production systems are becoming more flexible and agile to realize the need for more individualized products. Robotics technology can accomplish these demands, but programming and re-configuration of robots are associated with high costs, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The use of digital twins can significantly reduce these costs by providing monitoring and simulation capabilities for the robot and its environment using real-time data. The integration with an ontology as a knowledge base to describe the robot and its 3d-environment enables an automatic configuration of the digital twin and the particular robot. In this paper, this concept is coupled with cloud-computing to enable an effortless integration as service in existing cloud architectures and easy access using the common web-technology-stack for the end-users. A novel architecture is presented and implemented to incorporate the real system with its digital twin, the ontology and a planner to infer the actual operations from the knowledge base. Finally, the implementation is applied to the industrial manufacturing domain to assemble different THT-Devices on a PCB to evaluate the concept. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Search and selection of simulation model is an important process of building simulation application of complex system based on model composition in cloud architecture environment. This paper aims to solve the problem of lacking model correlation search and quality of service (QoS) weighted selection. The knowledge graph is used to describe the simulation models and their correlations. According to the model attributes (such as model name, domain, type, time scale, model granularity, etc.) and the model correlation (such as equipment model carrying relationship, etc.) set by users, the initial set of simulation models satisfying the requirements is found based on semantic search. Then, an optimization selection mechanism based on QoS is proposed to support users in customizing the weights of the QoS indices. The optimally ordered model candidate set is provided for selecting according to the weighting comparison of QoS indices. The experimental results show that the proposed method based on semantic search can support the effective selection of simulation models in cloud environment and the composite modeling of complex systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A workload distribution problem is quite topical nowadays. A large number of applications, which function in distributed environments, uses various techniques of a workload relocation. Yet very few studies consider the workload relocation in fog-computing environment emphasizing the increase of a search space and the distances between the computational nodes. In this paper a new workload distribution technique, based on ontological analysis of algorithm structures and the available resources is presented. The aim is to limit and reduce the search space of the workload distribution problem. Such strategy decreases the time of workload location and so decreases the time needed to solve the general computational task of application. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to solve the problem that the information sharing level of educational resources is not high in the cloud computing environment, it is required to improve the design of educational resource information sharing algorithm in cloud computing environment. Therefore, an educational resource information sharing algorithm based on big data association mining and quasi-linear regression analysis is proposed. In this algorithm, information fusion and comprehensive measurement index system reconstruction are performed to resource distribution information of the educational resource database based on attribute type and semantic ontology characteristics. The simulation results show that the algorithm performs well in convergence during resource scheduling in educational resource information sharing and can provide average sharing level up to 0.9247, so this algorithm can be adopted to allocate resources in a balance way. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing paradigm has emerged as response to challenges of managing and delivering on-demand services, in which provider and customer are willing to sign a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Even though the SLA is used to specify the level of services provided and the guarantee where negotiated conditions are specified, customers are not always satisfied. In order to promote the use of SLA without any ambiguities in quality requirements definitions, it is useful to develop an ontology-based support tool that automate the process of generating SLA regarding the interaction among the ISO 25010 quality characteristics. We propose an approach that uses ontology to semantically classify the quality requirements into the quality characteristics such as described by ISO 25010 and define their relationships. Taking into account customer requirements and considering their interactions before using cloud service is one of the most important and difficult tasks of SLA establishment. Ontology is used to semantically define diverging quality requirements and their relationships. In order to show the applicability of our approach, a tool for SLA generation is implemented and tested. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In cloud computing model, the data are usually encrypted before outsourced to the cloud server, which protects the data privacy, but also leaves keyword searches over ciphertext data a challenging problem. A keyword search scheme over encrypted data should achieve both index privacy and query privacy; moreover, verification of search results is desirable because the incorrectf results can be returned owing to system defects or the cloud server’s motivation to save computation recourses. Many multi-keyword search schemes have been proposed; however, few of these schemes are verifiable and adaptively index-hiding and adaptively query-hiding. In this paper, a semantically secure multi-keyword search scheme is constructed, which is adaptively index-hiding and adaptively query-hiding, also supports the correctness verification of search results. We provide a detailed performance comparison and give a thorough security proof by a sequence of games. The combined results demonstrate that our scheme is secure and practical. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) refers to the task of finding intended meaning of a word in the text. We have used Fuzzy Hindi WordNet (FHWN) which is an extension of Hindi WordNet with added fuzzy semantic relations between the synsets. However, fuzziness in semantic relations of Hindi WordNet was not considered in FHWN. Also, it is mentioned in literature that the sematic relations are fuzzy and some relations are more important than the others. In this work, we have amalgamated these two concepts and extended FHWN. We assigned membership values to the semantic relations of FHWN. With added fuzziness, resource becomes closer to human usage of language. Thereafter, we computed various centrality measures and the sense with highest value is deduced as the correct sense. The experimental results proved the proposed method leads to better performance than Fuzzy Hindi WordNet and proves the value for the research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In today's world due to ever increasing demand to make computers perform tasks of humans, machine learning is used. It is a tedious task to manually read the entire book and classify it based on its genre. Novice writers find it troublesome to figure out the genre of their book, which can affect its reach to the right audience. The proposed method gains knowledge from a large number of words from the books and transforms them into a feature matrix. During transformation, the size of the initial matrix is reduced using Wordnet and Principle Component Analysis. Then, AdaBoost classifier is applied to predict the genres of the books. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, the Internet and Cloud Computing technologies have enabled movies watching to be enjoyed anytime and anywhere in richer varieties and choices. As a result, one will be overwhelmed and tend to make poor choices. The increasing on-demand movies services motivates more choices of the programs to be offered and users need recommendation system to provide them with contextual and personalized suggestions. This paper proposes to use contextual ontological user profiling for movies recommendation which considers personalization in enhancing the effectiveness of the recommendations. We evaluated the performance of our proposed solution with few scenarios representing problems aroused from traditional collaborative and content-based recommendations. These problems are the cold start, data sparsity, over specialization, gray sheep and inefficiency issue. Evaluation results and analysis show that proposed work not only is capable of resolving these problems but is also competent in mitigating the scalability and inefficiency issue. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Healthcare providers in a heterogeneous distributed environment depend on many nonfunctional requirements or cross-cutting concerns that could affect the entire Healthcare Information System (HIS). The implementation of crosscutting concerns could potentially lead to a significant impact on the integrity of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), as well as code quality. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) encapsulates the crosscutting concerns to improve the overall quality of software development by reducing the required code to implement collection modules. In this paper, we propose an AOP-based novel approach to improve the elasticity of cloud-based EHR services. We propose an abstract framework for cloud-based HIS, which provides EHR interoperability through incorporating crosscutting concerns. The proposed framework eliminates the need to change the core code by adding high-level abstractions to complex cloud applications. We implement a prototype of the proposed framework to validate its ability in both separation of concerns and the ability to reuse EHR services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper describes a human-computer cloud environment supporting the deployment and functioning of human-based applications and allowing to decouple computing resource management issues (for this kind of applications) from application software. The paper focuses on two specific contributions lying in the heart of the proposed human-computer cloud environment: a) application platform, allowing to deploy human-based applications and using digital contracts to regulate the interactions between an application and its contributors, and b) the principles of ontology-based decision support service that is implemented on top of the human-computer cloud and uses task decomposition in order to deal with ad hoc tasks, algorithms for which are not described in advance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - By embracing the cloud computing paradigm enterprises are able to realise significant cost savings whilst boosting their agility and productivity. Yet, due mainly to security and privacy concerns, many enterprises are reluctant to migrate the storage and processing of their critical assets to the cloud. One way to alleviate these concerns, hence bolster the adoption of cloud computing, is to infuse suitable access control policies in cloud services. Nevertheless, the complexity inherent in such policies, stemming from the dynamic nature of cloud environments, calls for a framework capable of providing assurances with respect to the effectiveness of these policies. The work presented in this paper elaborates on such a framework. In particular, it proposes an approach for generically checking potential subsumption relations between access control policies that incorporate the contextual knowledge that characterises an access request and which needs to be taken into account for granting, or denying, the request. The proposed framework is expressed ontologically hence enabling automated reasoning, through semantic inferencing, about policy subsumption. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO S) is the most common endocrine disease in women of reproductive age. MicroRNA s (miRNA s or miRs) serve important roles in the physiological and pathological process of PCO S. To identify PCO S-associated miRNA s, the dataset GSE84376 was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed miRNA s (DE- miRNA s) were obtained from Gene-C loud Biotechnology Information and potential target genes were predicted using TargetScan, DIANA- microT-CD S, miRD B and miRTarBase tools. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape. Transcription factors were obtained from FunRich. DE-miRNAs were verified by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR . At the screening phase, there were seven DE- miRNA s in the PCO S group not present in the control group. In total, 935 target genes were identified, which are involved in the development and maturation of oocytes. Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, phosphatase and tensin homolog, cAMP responsive element binding protein 1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, interferon γ, Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1, transcription factor p65, insulin receptor substrate 1, DnaJ homolog superfamily C member 10 and casein kinase 2 a 1 were identified as the top 10 hub genes in the protein-protein interaction network. Specificity protein 1 was the most enriched transcription factor. At the validation phase, the levels of Homo sapiens (hsa)-miR- 3188 and hsa-miR-3135b were significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group. In addition, the expression level of hsa-miR-3135b was significantly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved, the fertilization rate and the cleavage rate (P<0.05). The present bioinformatics study on miRNA s may offer a novel understanding of the mechanism of PCO S, and may serve to identify novel miRNA therapeutic targets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Security challenges are the most important obstacles for the advancement of IT-based on-demand services and cloud computing as an emerging technology. In this paper, a structural policy management engine has been introduced to enhance the reliability of managing different policies in clouds and to provide standard as well as dedicated security levels (rings) based on the capabilities of the cloud provider and the requirements of cloud customers. Cloud security ontology (CSON) is an object-oriented framework defined to manage and enable appropriate communication between the potential security terms of cloud service providers. CSON uses two super classes to establish appropriate mapping between the requirements of cloud customers and the capabilities of the service provider. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Today most of traditional forms of education are not suitable for requirements of educational development and can’t keep up with changes in learning demand over time, but Computer networks have provided many opportunities for it. By Cloud Computing software and files are imported into cloud, so word processing, presentations, databases, and more can be accessed from a web browsers. Educational institutions can take advantage of cloud applications to provide students and teachers with free or cost-effective alternatives instead of expensive proprietary productivity tools. In this paper we use semantic models in cloud computing to provide platform-independent data presentation and improve the description of the service. We analyze and discuss how cloud computing can affect boundaries of educational resources in background of semantic web by providing a technological solution using experimental and semantic platforms and numerically cloud services. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has become the most influential paradigm in recent years, both in industry and academia. A Cloud provider delivers Cloud services to businesses or individuals. However, each Cloud provider uses its own techniques to describe their Cloud services. It is therefore difficult to compare Cloud offers and then provide the appropriate service to the user. Especially that the Cloud services can provide the same functionalities, but they differ by their quality of service, price, Cloud characteristics, service credibility, and so on. The variety of these techniques is due to the lack of Cloud service description standardization. To deal with such issues, we propose in this paper a Cloud service description ontology that assists the Cloud service publication, discovery and selection processes. The proposed description will be extended from the Linked USDL language to describe Cloud services thanks to its expressiveness by covering four aspects namely technical, operational, business and semantic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background When a paucity of clinical information is communicated from ordering physicians to radiologists at the time of radiology order entry, suboptimal imaging interpretations and patient care may result. Objectives Compare documentation of relevant clinical information in electronic health record (EHR) provider note to computed tomography (CT) order requisition, prior to ordering of head CT for emergency department (ED) patients presenting with headache. Methods In this institutional review board-approved retrospective observational study performed between April 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014 at an adult quaternary academic hospital, we reviewed data from 666 consecutive ED encounters for patients with headaches who received head CT. The primary outcome was the number of concept unique identifiers (CUIs) relating to headache extracted via ontology-based natural language processing from the history of present illness (HPI) section in ED notes compared with the number of concepts obtained from the imaging order requisition. Results Our analysis was conducted on cases where the HPI note section was completed prior to image order entry, which occurred in 23.1% (154/666) of encounters. For these 154 encounters, the number of CUIs specific to headache per note extracted from the HPI (median = 3, interquartile range [IQR]: 2-4) was significantly greater than the number of CUIs per encounter obtained from the imaging order requisition (median = 1, IQR: 1-2; Wilcoxon signed rank p < 0.0001). Extracted concepts from notes were distinct from order requisition indications in 92.9% (143/154) of cases. Conclusion EHR provider notes are a valuable source of relevant clinical information at the time of imaging test ordering. Automated extraction of clinical information from notes to prepopulate imaging order requisitions may improve communication between ordering physicians and radiologists, enhance efficiency of ordering process by reducing redundant data entry, and may help improve clinical relevance of clinical decision support at the time of order entry, potentially reducing provider burnout from extraneous alerts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Information processing systems utilizing the input received from human contributors are currently gaining popularity. One of the problems relevant to most of these systems is that they need a large number of contributors to function properly, while collecting this number of contributors may require significant effort and time. In the ongoing research, this problem is addressed by adaptation of cloud computing resource management principles to human-computer systems. The proposed human-computer cloud environment relies heavily on the use of ontologies for both resource discovery and automatic decision support workflow composition. This paper describes the set of main ontological models of the proposed human-computer cloud. Namely, the ontological model of the cloud environment, ontological model of the decision support system based on this environment and the ontology-based mechanism for workflow construction. The paper also illustrates the principles of dynamic workflow construction by an example from e-Tourism domain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - MOBILE healthcare systems focus to achieve two specific goals: Making e-health applications and medical information available anywhere and anytime and the invisibility of computing details. In this paper a cloud based mobile application has been initiated to popularize herbal medicines among mainstream population. This system responds to queries posted by users on medicinal plants relating to particular disease by analysing research articles from PubMed via PubMed CLOUD and MeSH thesaurus. In this proposal, we particularly focus on applying text mining techniques on biomedical literature to unearth information on disease curing phyto-chemical properties of medicinal plants. The framework also includes an ontological structure to buffer the retrieved information and thereby enhances the overall system efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we utilize ontology-based information extraction for semantic analysis and terminology linking from a corpus of software requirement specification documents from 400 enterprise-level software development projects. The purpose for this ontology is to perform semi-supervised learning on enterprise-level specification documents towards an automated method of defining productivity metrics for software development profiling. Profiling an enterprise-level software development project in the context of productivity is necessary in order to objectively measure productivity of a software development project and to identify areas of improvement in software development when compared to similar software development profiles or benchmark of these profiles. We developed a semi-novel methodology of applying NLP OBIE techniques towards determining software development productivity metrics, and evaluated this methodology on multiple practical enterprise-level software projects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, Cloud Computing has emerged as a new model for hosting, managing and delivering services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) over the Internet. Enterprises and vendors are continuously migrating their services to the Cloud, this resulted an exponential amount of data, services and resources stored in data centers. Since there is no standard about Cloud service description or publication, therefore a key requirement that every Cloud provider needs to take into consideration is efficient management of resources and services by providing automated solutions, for a better service publication and discovery. The proposed approach aims to manage Cloud SaaS services for an efficient publication by classifying them into sets according to their domain to reduce the search space then interconnecte the SaaS services of the same domain in a Semantic Network using the similarity measure (Input/Output similarity) between concepts. The proposed solution takes advantages from multidimensional index framework, WordNet Domain Ontology and semantic Web. A guided publication process and an implemented prototype are introduced validating the system using a real data set corpus. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To ensure successful running of service composition in software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications under dynamic cloud computing environments, service semantic verification becomes essentially important and meaningful. Taking advantages from both semantic expression in dependence record types (DRT) and completeness of service description in session types (ST), this paper presents a novel method for service composition verification at semantic level. Based on the characteristics of DRT, an ontology approach is proposed to enrich DRTs semantic description and establish a set of subtyping rules to characterize relationships of transmitted messages among services. As a general service composition description and semantic verification method, message DRT extended multiparty session types (MDRT-MST) are then constructed. A theoretical justification on the main patterns of service composition models is given through the extended reduction rules. As a case study, an online payment system is implemented for evaluating the system performance in practice. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in service reduction and verification for the real-world SaaS applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is the leading technology for genome-wide transcript quantification. However, publicly available RNA-seq data is currently provided mostly in raw form, a significant barrier for global and integrative retrospective analyses. ARCHS4 is a web resource that makes the majority of published RNA-seq data from human and mouse available at the gene and transcript levels. For developing ARCHS4, available FASTQ files from RNA-seq experiments from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were aligned using a cloud-based infrastructure. In total 187,946 samples are accessible through ARCHS4 with 103,083 mouse and 84,863 human. Additionally, the ARCHS4 web interface provides intuitive exploration of the processed data through querying tools, interactive visualization, and gene pages that provide average expression across cell lines and tissues, top co-expressed genes for each gene, and predicted biological functions and protein-protein interactions for each gene based on prior knowledge combined with co-expression. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Semantic Annotation is the main activity for the semantic web, but it has been faced with many challenges which has hindered its growth as initially expected. While several tools exist for providing semantic annotation to web documents, the techniques used in these tools vary very widely. Also, the mode of implementation and the solutions offered by the tools are inconsistent with each other leaving end users confused on the appropriate tool for use to deliver their expected results. Based on these, a holistic perspective to the development of semantic annotation tools as well as their implementation is necessary. This is to ensure uniformity in the expected end results and guarantee a continuous, dynamic and consistent semantic annotation for web documents; encompassing the complete needs of end users. To achieve this, cloud computing is proposed for the delivery of semantic annotation as a holistic service, as it provides an enabling environment for processing the vast amount of data required to annotate web documents. Also, cloud computing essential characteristics such as ubiquitous network access, rapid elasticity and on-demand self-service are very necessary to achieve a holistic semantic annotation service for documents on the web. This paper presents a cloud-driven framework to facilitate the delivery of a holistic semantic annotation on the web. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In an open source cloud computing platform such as OpenStack, operators use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model to grant access to cloud resources. However, these user-level role-based access control techniques fail to include comprehensive user context. We believe a situational aware framework will improve security by bringing in user's context to such cloud systems. In this paper, we create a semantically rich context-sensitive access control system for OpenStack by incorporating the user's current context attributes like location, time, etc. In a proof-of-concept implementation, we integrate a knowledge graph with our own access control system to express and enforce the contextual-situation policies in OpenStack. The proposed system provides enhanced, flexible access control while minimizing the overhead of altering the existing access control framework. We also discuss various use cases, to highlight the benefits of our system and show enforcement results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently the topic of how to improve the efficiency of semantic reasoning on large-scale knowledge graph has gained considerable attention from global researchers and engineers. Most of existing distributed parallel algorithms for inference based on OWL Horst ruleset require multiple iterations. Moreover, in the process of which, the data stored repeatedly generate redundant records, resulting the reasoning in low overall efficiency. In order to address the challenges, firstly, we presents a storage solution combining variable storage and multivariable connector in accordance with characteristics of OWL Horst ruleset in the context of knowledge graph, aiming at reduction of repeated data storage and data transmission cost. Then, on the basis of such scheme, a streaming reasoning algorithm is introduced to curtail iterations and promote efficiency. Experimental results on LUBM and DBpedia datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework and algorithm could deliver superior performance in scalability and efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is nowadays becoming a popular paradigm for the provision of computing infrastructure that enables organizations to achieve financial savings. On the other hand, there are some known obstacles, among which vendor lock-in stands out. Furthermore, due to missing standards and heterogeneities of cloud storage systems, the migration of data to alternative cloud providers is expensive and time-consuming. We propose an approach based on Semantic Web services and AI planning to tackle cloud vendor data lock-in problem. To complete the mentioned task, data structures and data type mapping rules between different types of cloud storage systems are defined. The migration of data among different providers of platform as a service is presented in order to prove the practical applicability of the proposed approach. Additionally, this concept was also applied to software as a service model of cloud computing to perform one-shot data migration from Zoho CRM to Salesforce CRM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the rapid development of cloud computing and web technologies has led to a significant advancement to chain geospatial information services (GI services) in order to solve complex geospatial problems. However, the construction of a problem-solving workflow requires considerable expertise for end-users. Currently, few studies design a knowledge base to capture and share geospatial problem-solving knowledge. This paper abstracts a geospatial problem as a task that can be further decomposed into multiple subtasks. The task distinguishes three distinct granularities: Geooperator, Atomic Task, and Composite Task. A task model is presented to define the outline of problem solution at a conceptual level that closely reflects the processes for problem-solving. A task-oriented knowledge base that leverages an ontology-based approach is built to capture and share task knowledge. This knowledge base provides the potential for reusing task knowledge when faced with a similar problem. Conclusively, the details of implementation are described through using a meteorological early-warning analysis as an example. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the fast adoption of cloud computing, the use of biometric technologies has evolved to a different way of providing security, preserving privacy, and analysing personal traits for various purposes. The main components of any biometric system, such as biometric sensing, data gathering, feature extraction, identification, verification, recognition, and analytics, are now handled over distributed networks. Many of the biometric system services are presented over such networks which are followed by the creation of a new concept ‘biometric-as-a-service (BaaS)’. Recent BaaS approaches usually focus on identifying the effective distributed architectures, policies, and use case recommendations. However, there is a strong need to focus on developing a semantic framework which should rely on a biometric ontology. This study presents such an ontology covering the uses of different biometric modalities, evaluation and assessment of biometric systems, modelling biometric processes, and analyses through interlinked relations with biometric stakeholders. In order to shed light on how such an ontology is useful for BaaS solutions, a case study focusing on the various uses of biometric modalities is presented. The selected use case addresses the asylum seeker or immigrant identification problems regarding the border security challenges where facial biometrics are benefited. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The ever-increasing number of customers that have been using cloud computing environments is driving heterogeneity in the cloud infrastructures. The incorporation of heterogeneous resources to traditional homogeneous infrastructures is supported by specific resource managers cohabiting with traditional resource managers. This blend of resource managers raises interoperability issues in the Cloud management domain as customer services are exposed to disjoint mechanisms and incompatibilities between APIs and interfaces. In addition, deploying and configuring HPC workloads in such environments makes porting HPC applications, from traditional cluster environments to the Cloud, complex and ineffectual. Many efforts have been taken to create solutions and standards for ameliorating interoperability issues in inter-cloud and multi-cloud environments and parallels exist between these efforts and the current drive for the adoption of heterogeneity in the Cloud. The work described in this paper attempts to exploit these parallels; managing interoperability issues in Cloud from a unified perspective. In this paper the mOSAIC ontology, pillar of the IEEE 2302 — Standard for Intercloud Interoperability and Federation, is extended towards creating the CloudLightning Ontology (CL-Ontology), in which the incorporation of heterogeneous resources and HPC environments in the Cloud are considered. To support the CL-Ontology, a generic architecture is presented as a driver to manage heterogeneity in the Cloud and, as a use case example of the proposed architecture, the internal architecture of the CloudLightning system is redesigned and presented to show the feasibility of incorporating a semantic engine to alleviate interoperability issues to facilitate the incorporation of HPC in Cloud. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper introduces a method for automatic workflow extraction from texts using Process-Oriented Case-Based Reasoning (POCBR). While the current workflow management systems implement mostly different complicated graphical tasks based on advanced distributed solutions (e.g., cloud computing and grid computation), workflow knowledge acquisition from texts using case-based reasoning represents more expressive and semantic case representations. We propose in this context, an ontology-based workflow extraction framework to acquire processual knowledge from texts. Our methodology extends the classic NLP techniques to extract and disambiguate complex tasks and relations in texts. Using a graph-based representation of workflows and a domain ontology, our extraction process uses a context-aware approach to recognize workflow components in texts: data and control flows. We applied our framework in a technical domain in bioinformatics: i.e., phylogenetic analyses. An evaluation based on workflow semantic similarities in a gold standard proves that our approach provides promising results in the process extraction domain. Both data and implementation of our framework are available in: http://labo.bioinfo.uqam.ca/tgowler. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has recently attracted full attention of many organizations due to its economic, business and technical benefits. Indeed, we observe that the proliferation of offers by cloud providers raises several challenges. One of these innovative challenges is discovering and selecting services in order to deploy applications in multi-PaaS environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic and declarative approach to discover and select services offered by multi-PaaS providers. It enables developers to express their requirements and PaaS providers to expose their offers in manifests. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Today, the Web knows a rapid increase in data level that makes their processing and storage limited in traditional technologies. That is why future technology tries to exploit the notion of semantics and ontology by adapting them to big data technology to allow a fundamental change in the access to voluminous information in the web. That Intended to have a complete and relevant response to the user request. Our research work focuses on the semantic web. Focus exactly on the semantic search on many data expressed by RDF (Resource Description Framework) in distributed system. The semantic language proposed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) provides the formalism necessary for the representation of data for the Semantic Web. However, only a knowledge representation format is insufficient and we need powerful response mechanisms to manage effectively global and distributed queries across a set of stand-alone and heterogeneous RDF resources marked by the dynamic and scalable nature of their content. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Many potential cloud consumers are overburdened by the challenges persisting when discovering, assessing, and selecting contemporary Cloud Service offerings: the cloud market is vast and fast-moving, the selection criteria are ambiguous, service knowledge is scattered through the Internet, and features as well as prices are complex and incomparable. Much research has been carried out to create cloud service registries to help users select cloud services for eventual consumption, especially within the field of semantic web services. Through analyzing real-world requirements of six use cases we identified a gap in research for user-centric technologies. We fill this gap by creating a business vocabulary reflecting common service selection criteria, defining a textual domain specific language to let any user describe services easily, and implementing a novel brokering and matchmaking component to support users in their selection process. As a combination of those technologies, we create the Open Service Compendium (OSC), a crowd-sourced cloud service registry. Our evaluation activities highlight how these developments solve real-world challenges in diverse near-production settings. All of this implies that a substantial benefit for service registry users can be created by following a simple architecture that is focused on their concrete needs — instead of aiming for highest sophistication and broadest applicability as observed in many of the related works. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) requires an infrastructure that is combining the capabilities of resource-constrained but mobile and context-aware devices with that of immovable but powerful resources in the cloud. Application execution shall be boosted and battery consumption reduced. Our goal is to relieve mobile devices by enabling applications to cooperate transparently with components provided by third parties remotely, locally, or both. For this purpose, we developed SAM - the Semantic-aware Middleware - and the SAM Store. The latter resembles a registry. It allows component providers to publish semantically enriched interfaces and to offer corresponding local and remote implementations. SAM makes use of the SAM Store to match local interprocess communication (IPC) messages transparently against local and remote components. This architecture facilitates the integration of powerful, but resource-intensive remote components, which may be prioritized over local ones, and fosters various patterns of cooperation that demonstrate useful solutions in the area of MCC. By means of a realistic scenario, our evaluation proves the efficiency with respect to latency and practicality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Medical organizations find it challenging to adopt cloud-based electronic medical records services, due to the risk of data breaches and the resulting compromise of patient data. Existing authorization models follow a patient centric approach for EHR management where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients' end. This however creates a significant overhead for the patient who has to authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given the multiple personnel involved in providing care and that at times the patient may not be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need of developing a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy cloud-based EHR management. We have developed a novel, centralized, attribute based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based EHR's access authority to the medical providers. In this paper, we describe this novel ABE approach as well as the prototype system that we have created to illustrate it. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the popularity of cloud computing and micro service architectures, various service ecosystems including services, venders, and service-based processes continuously emerge on Internet or in an enterprise. Semantics of services from different venders may be described by distributed domain ontologies. Distributed knowledge brings difficulty to competition and cooperation among services, and hampers the evolution of a service ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a distributed knowledge based evolution model (DKEM) to promote competition and cooperation among services from different venders. DKEM considers stability as key factor in competition, and a stability evaluation model is designed to compute stability of services, venders, and service-based processes according to service invocation histories. Based on the evaluation model, two evolution patterns are given, and they can automatically explore new and more stable cooperation among services by means of runtime self-adaption mechanism. A prototype system for DKEM is implemented and a series of experiments show that DKEM is effective for competition and cooperation among services with distributed knowledge, and, evolved processes have higher stability and response efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing offers attractive options to migrate corporate applications without the end users needing to manage any physical resources. While this 'ease' is appealing, several issues arise: 1) Which Cloud Providers (CPs) offer the best infrastructure at a fair budget? 2) I am no Cloud expert, then what are the characteristics of the infrastructure which best fit my application? To answer these questions, one must solve a resource management problem, that is, the allocation of computing, storage, networking and (indirectly) cost resources to a set of applications such that the performance objectives of the application are fulfilled. There are many approaches which answer separately these questions but there is no comprehensive and easily usable solution for these issues. MANeUveR solves them by integrating the following components: 1) a Web User Interface offers the end user the possibility to describe his application in terms of interactions between components and their software and hardware requirements, 2) an Offers Management System, through a crawler, periodically updates an ontology with infrastructure and services details from different CPs, 3) a Recommendation Engine provides a (sub) optimal solution for application deployment in the CP infrastructure regarding the leasing price of the virtual machines needed for deployment and their characteristics. Using a secure-billing e-mail service, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increasing adoption of cloud computing, a growing number of users outsource their datasets to cloud. To preserve privacy, the datasets are usually encrypted before outsourcing. However, the common practice of encryption makes the effective utilization of the data difficult. For example, it is difficult to search the given keywords in encrypted datasets. Many schemes are proposed to make encrypted data searchable based on keywords. However, keyword-based search schemes ignore the semantic representation information of users' retrieval, and cannot completely meet with users search intention. Therefore, how to design a content-based search scheme and make semantic search more effective and context-aware is a difficult challenge. In this paper, we propose ECSED, a novel semantic search scheme based on the concept hierarchy and the semantic relationship between concepts in the encrypted datasets. ECSED uses two cloud servers. One is used to store the outsourced datasets and return the ranked results to data users. The other one is used to compute the similarity scores between the documents and the query and send the scores to the first server. To further improve the search efficiency, we utilize a tree-based index structure to organize all the document index vectors. We employ the multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data as our basic frame to propose two secure schemes. The experiment results based on the real world datasets show that the scheme is more efficient than previous schemes. We also prove that our schemes are secure under the known ciphertext model and the known background model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The world that we have today is intelligent web that is a web that aims to show, present, and deliver intelligent information. The web contains a diversified amount of information in terms of veracity, velocity, and variance. This scenario demands for intelligent data mining agents that are able to retrieve information and derive patterns and relationships in this information. Contemporary research focuses on pattern discovery using analytical tools but does not provide for ways and means to successfully interpret the source and the authenticity of this information. Our paper thus focuses on embedding the trustable components inside semantic web so as to enable big data mining agents to successfully retrieve trustworthy information from the semantic web. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accuracy of search results over web is improving steadily due to ongoing incorporation of semantic web technologies into traditional information retrieval approaches of the present web. These semantic technologies along with knowledge base they contain are being exploited at large scale by all mainstream web search engines to provide conceptually precise search results to satisfy user's efficient information needs on web. In this paper, first, semantic search and its key concerns have been explored and discussed. Second, it revisits various semantic search approaches which process and consume knowledge from semantic technologies to improve precision of search results. Thirdly, keyword to concept mapping is revisited and illustrated using domain Ontology. Finally, key design issues of search engines incorporating semantics have been revisited. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In today's era of digitization, due to the improper structuring of huge data available from various sources leading to poor interlinking of data, the web is not being utilized to its full potential. So, there is a need for re-establishing the structures of openly published data on the web by giving various specifications or frameworks of data published in cyberspace. With the aim of better utilization of web data and transition from keyword-based search to contextual search, the Semantic web has emerged as a key milestone. In this direction, Tim Berners Lee has proposed the conventions namely RDF and SPARQL for linking and querying the machine-processable shared data on the web and also a 5-star linked data scheme to distinguish the type of data on web based on its linking properties. This paper presents a Framework for Linking and querying open datasets on government portals, embedding semantics in the data by RDF alignment using state-of-art tools such as OpenRefine and Twinkle tool. The 5-Star scheme has been discussed and practical demonstration of enriching data is given. This clearly puts forward the transition from web of documents to web of data. This paper also presents the framework for translating the data in datasets to the graph based RDF data in Triple format. This translated data is then queried using standard SPARQL Queries showcasing the linked data fetched in tuple format. The data-graph of the resultant linked data is also presented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In today's world of globalization, there is a serious need of incorporating semantics in Education Domain which is very significant with an ultimate goal of providing an efficient, adaptive and personalized learning environment. An attempt towards this goal has been made to develop an Education based Ontology with some capability to describe a semantic web based sharable knowledge. So as a contribution, this paper presents a revisit towards amalgamating Semantics in Education. In this direction, an effort has been made to construct an Education based Ontology using Protege 5.2.0, where a hierarchy of classes and subclasses have been defined along with their properties, relations, and instances. Finally, at the end of this paper an implementation is also presented involving query retrieval using DLquery illustrations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We have developed a cloud-based (AWS and IBM SoftLayer) knowledge environment for scalable semantic mining of scientific literature and PTM integrative knowledge discovery in precision medicine, building upon our novel natural language processing (NLP) technologies and bioinformatics infrastructure. We provided semantic integration of full-scale PubMed mining results from disparate text mining tools, along with kinase-substrate data from iPTMnet, and PTM proteoforms and their relations from Protein Ontology (PRO). We shared the digital objects of those applications in multiple interoperable formats and have registered them in bioCADDIE using CEDAR. We experimented with multiple system setups using operating system, programming language, web server, or database server that best fits each application. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of cloud computing by only paying for what we use and readily experimenting with additional services.

AB  - Cloud is a multitenant architecture that allows the cloud users to share the resources via servers and is used in various applications, including data classification. Data classification is a widely used data mining technique for big data analysis. It helps the learners to discover hidden data patterns by training massive data collected from the real world. Because this trained model is the private asset of an entity, it should be protected from all other noncollaborative entities. Therefore, it is essential to take effective measures to preserve the confidential data. The objective of this paper is to preserve the privacy of the confidential data in the cloud environment by introducing the medical data classification method. In view of that, this paper presents a method for medical data classification using a novel ontology and whale optimization-based support vector machine (OW-SVM) approach. Initially, privacy-preserved data are developed adopting Kronecker product bat approach, and then, ontology is built for the feature selection process. Ontology and whale optimization-based support vector machine is then proposed by integrating ontology and whale optimization algorithm into SVM, in which ontology and whale optimization algorithm is used for the feasible selection of kernel parameters. The experiment is done using 3 heart disease datasets, such as Cleveland, Switzerland, and Hungarian. In a comparative analysis, the performance of the OW-SVM approach is compared with that of K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, decision tree, SVM, and OW-SVM, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and fitness, as the evaluation metrics. The OW-SVM approach could achieve maximum performance with accuracy of 83.21%, the sensitivity of 91.49%, specificity of 73%, and fitness of 81.955, outperforming existing comparative techniques. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Clowder is an open source data management system to support data curation of long tail data and metadata across multiple research domains and diverse data types. Institutions and labs can install and customize their own instance of the framework on local hardware or on remote cloud computing resources to provide a shared service to distributed communities of researchers. Data can be ingested directly from instruments or manually uploaded by users and then shared with remote collaborators using a web front end. We discuss some of the challenges encountered in designing and developing a system that can be easily adapted to different scientific areas including digital preservation, geoscience, material science, medicine, social science, cultural heritage and the arts. Some of these challenges include support for large amounts of data, horizontal scaling of domain specific preprocessing algorithms, ability to provide new data visualizations in the web browser, a comprehensive Web service API for automatic data ingestion and curation, a suite of social annotation and metadata management features to support data annotation by communities of users and algorithms, and a web based front-end to interact with code running on heterogeneous clusters, including HPC resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Cloud Computing field, with the increasing number of Cloud Services available thanks to several cloud providers, looking for a particular service has become very difficult, especially with the evolution of the stakeholders' needs. At the same time requirements specifications have become more and more complex to define in a formal representation and to analyse, since the stakeholders' goals are typically high-level, abstract, and hard-to-measure. For these reasons it would be useful to automate, as much as possible, requirements analysis. In this work we propose an automatic classification and modelling of requirements that are expressed in a natural language form, and an automatic identification of cloud services categories from requirements in order to support the development of a cloud application. Automated requirements analysis is not an easy subject, due to the natural languages variability and ambiguity, that's why different machine/deep learning and natural language processing approaches are used and compared. The target data set is provided by the Open-Security tera-PROMISE repository. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The goal of this work is to map Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts to DBpedia resources using widely accepted ontology relations from the Simple Knowledge Organization System (skos:exactMatch, skos:closeMatch) and from the Resource Description Framework Schema (rdfs:seeAlso), as a result of which a complete mapping from UMLS (UMLS 2016AA) to DBpedia (DBpedia 2015-10) is made publicly available that includes 221 690 skos:exactMatch, 26 276 skos:closeMatch, and 6 784 322 rdfs:seeAlso mappings. Methods: We propose a method called circular resolution that utilizes a combination of semantic annotators to map UMLS concepts to DBpedia resources. A set of annotators annotate definitions of UMLS concepts returning DBpedia resources while another set performs annotation on DBpedia resource abstracts returning UMLS concepts. Our pipeline aligns these 2 sets of annotations to determine appropriate mappings from UMLS to DBpedia. Results: We evaluate our proposed method using structured data from the Wikidata knowledge base as the ground truth, which consists of 4899 already existing UMLS to DBpedia mappings. Our results show an 83% recall with 77% precision-at-one (P@1) in mapping UMLS concepts to DBpedia resources on this testing set. Conclusions: The proposed circular resolution method is a simple yet effective technique for linking UMLS concepts to DBpedia resources. Experiments using Wikidata-based ground truth reveal a high mapping accuracy. In addition to the complete UMLS mapping downloadable in n-triple format, we provide an online browser and a RESTful service to explore the mappings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article describes how cloud applications are negotiated, deployed, monitored, evaluated and terminated through the service level agreements (SLA). The service definition & their objectives, performance measures, pricing, roles of the involved parties are stated as part of the SLA. Searching for SLA templates from the provider's place is considered as a cumbersome process for the consumer. Also, it is not guaranteed that retrieved SLAs always match with the consumer requirements. Hence, semantic search engine platforms for cloud SLA using a novel architecture are introduced here. SLA agreements are crawled from the web and annotation is performed in the agreement terms using SLA ontologies to fasten and improve the accuracy of the search process. In the proposed architecture, 3 ontologies are developed for SaaS, PaaS and IaaS as well as 140 SLA documents are gathered. Results revealed that the search efficacy is almost 90% in finding the desired SLA for the consumer to ease negotiation. Moreover, the performance is compared with similar search engine GoNTogle, and it was observed that proposed model produced good results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The big data approach offers a powerful alternative to Evidence-based medicine. This approach could guide cancer management thanks to machine learning application to large-scale data. Aim of the Thyroid CoBRA (Consortium for Brachytherapy Data Analysis) project is to develop a standardized web data collection system, focused on thyroid cancer. The Metabolic Radiotherapy Working Group of Italian Association of Radiation Oncology (AIRO) endorsed the implementation of a consortium directed to thyroid cancer management and data collection. The agreement conditions, the ontology of the collected data and the related software services were defined by a multicentre ad hoc working-group (WG). Six Italian cancer centres were firstly started the project, defined and signed the Thyroid COBRA consortium agreement. Three data set tiers were identified: Registry, Procedures and Research. The COBRA-Storage System (C-SS) appeared to be not time-consuming and to be privacy respecting, as data can be extracted directly from the single centre's storage platforms through a secured connection that ensures reliable encryption of sensible data. Automatic data archiving could be directly performed from Image Hospital Storage System or the Radiotherapy Treatment Planning Systems. The C-SS architecture will allow “Cloud storage way” or “distributed learning” approaches for predictive model definition and further clinical decision support tools development. The development of the Thyroid COBRA data Storage System C-SS through a multicentre consortium approach appeared to be a feasible tool in the setup of complex and privacy saving data sharing system oriented to the management of thyroid cancer and in the near future every cancer type. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the growing popularity of cloud computing, the individuals and corporations are motivated to outsource their data to the public cloud server for economic savings and accessing to data at any time, any place, and with any device. Note that the outsourced data may be private and contain sensitive information, such as financial trading files, electronic health records, private secret logs and individual sensitive multimedia data. To minimize the probability of the risk of sensitive data leakage, it is desirable for the data owners to encrypt sensitive data before sending them to cloud. However, it also hinders the usability of outsourced data, such as data retrieval operation. Searchable encryption (SE) technology is an important approach to deal with this problem, which enables the users to search over encrypted data to realize effective data utilization. In searchable encryption schemes, the cloud storage server is assumed honest-but-curious (or say, semi-trusted), who is honest to execute the required storage and retrieval operations, but also curious to discover the plaintext keyword or file of users. The security requirement of SE should guarantee that only authorized users can decrypt encrypted data with decryption keys and then obtain plaintext files. In recent years, diverse SE schemes are proposed, which pay attention to both privacy and practicability of the system. However, most of the existing multi-keyword searchable encryption schemes have neither taken into consideration the location information of the keywords nor measured the similarity of the synonym keywords. At the same time, the search efficiency is low and the index construction time is too long. In this paper, we propose a fast multi-keyword semantic ranked search scheme. Firstly, for the first time, the concept of weighted domain scoring is introduced to searchable encryption to calculate the document relevance scores. The keywords in different domains (title, abstract, etc.) are measured by different weighted domain score. Secondly, the retrieved keywords are semantically expanded to their synonym sets and the semantic similarities of the synonyms are calculated. Combining the semantic similarity, the weighted domain score and the relevance scores, we construct the encrypted document index with higher accuracy. To improve the efficiency of MRSE (multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data), we partition the document index vector into several pieces and generate mark vector according to these pieces. Comparing the document mark vector and the query mark vector, we effectively filter a large number of irrelevant documents. The time for calculating the relevance scores and ranking is greatly reduced. Finally, document index vectors are partitioned into several sub-vectors, which are encrypted by the matrices with smaller dimensions. The method greatly reduces the computation overhead of generating encrypted indices and further improves the system efficiency. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the multi-keyword semantic ranked search with high efficiency. It improves the retrieval efficiency, reduces the encrypted index generation time and returns more accurate ranking results. It also guarantees the privacy and security of data. Both the basic and enhanced schemes proposed in this paper are proved secure in known background model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - 'Communication achieves all, and interaction creates value.' To realize innovative value services of 'Internet plus' applications in the context where networking interaction exists everywhere, the supply-demand interaction and its semantic interoperability techniques become the golden key to facilitate on-demand business collaboration, construct 'Supply-Side' services oriented towards software models, and finally resolve the 'Information Islands' crisis of deep Web resources (e.g. services) in Cloud Computing. From the perspective of service-oriented software engineering, this paper explores the nature that Model Driven Architecture (MDA) evolves into Model-interaction Driven Architecture (MiDA), and proposes three core techniques in MiDA, including RGPS requirements metamodel framework, O-RGPS construction metamodel for 'Supply-Side' services, and their international standardization on Metadmodel framework for interpretability, i.e. MFI(O-RGPS). In detail, RGPS requirements metamodel framework intends to characterize diverse and personalized service requirements at different levels of granularity, and then it can support requirements directed interaction between models. O-RGPS construction metamodel can facilitate domain knowledge or topic mining for the subjects of 'Supply-Side' service. In addition, it introduces the semantics enhanced ontology and metamodeling approach to construct an interoperable structure for 'Supply-Side' services, in terms of RGPS annotations, semantic annotations and inherent associations between them. Considering MFI(O-RGPS), it provides a series of standard registration metamodels for different types of models, including ontology, role and goal models, process models, and service models. With these metamodels, semantic interoperation between heterogeneous models can be conducted by sharing registration information in a unified way. Furthermore, this paper reveals two types of relationships between these three core techniques in MiDA. One is the basic relationships derived from the joint action of multiple meaning triangle patterns; the other is the virtual-reality interaction and interoperation between software models. Moreover, the authors conclude that as the evolution of MDA, MiDA is compatible with MDA. In the end, this paper discusses the ISO international standard series named MFI(O-RGPS), which was proposed by the authors and aims at semantic interoperability governance and management of software models. In order to evaluate the interoperability capability of MFI(O-RGPS) standards, this paper takes MFI-5, Metamodel for process model registration, as an example and proposes a method to measure the semantic interoperability capability of MFI-5 for heterogeneous business process models. More specifically, we define the mappings from specified process modeling languages or specifications (e.g. BPEL and EPC) to the metamodel in MFI-5 to register administrative information and selected metadata of process models. Based on these mapping rules, for each specific process modeling language, the proportion of mapped elements in the total number of elements can be used to quantify the interoperability degree of MFI-5 to the process models described with this modeling language. The results suggest that our proposed interoperability theory and method can enhance the innovation and service ability of 'Internet plus' enterprises in cloud computing and big data analysis, and satisfy the requirements for both dynamic business collaboration across enterprises and personalized services recommendation oriented towards multiple tenants. This implies that our method can provide interoperable construction for 'Supply-Side' services to support supply-demand interaction in practice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As cloud computing is getting matured day by day, there has been overwhelming interest among the users to avail a plethora of cloud services. Often, these services appear identical in terms of their functionality though they differ in pricing models, computational power, storage policies and Quality-of-Service parameters making the process of service discovery and selection an intricate task. In the absence of any standard specifications, cloud service providers continue to use their own vocabulary and this further complicates the selection process. Even popular search engines like Google and MSN are not efficient enough to properly identify the most appropriate cloud service that can meet customer requirements. Thus, in the presence of multiple selection parameters and constraints, selecting a required cloud service is a daunting task. In order to address this issue, we work toward developing a reasoning mechanism to optimally resolve the similarities across cloud services by using cloud ontology. A multi-agent-based framework has been proposed for effective cloud service discovery and selection with the help of a standardized service registry and by employing semantically guided searching process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The expansion of the services of the Semantic Web and the evolution of cloud computing technologies have significantly enhanced the capability of preserving and publishing information in standard open web formats, such that data can be both human-readable and machine-processable. This situation meets the challenge in the current big data era to effectively store, retrieve, and analyze resource description framework (RDF) data in swarms. This paper presents an overview of the existing challenges, evolving opportunities, and current developments towards managing big RDF data in clouds and provides guidance and substantial lessons learned from research in big data management. In particular, it highlights the basic principles of RDF data management, which allow researchers to know the most recent stage in developing RDF graphs and its achievement. Additionally, the research provides comparative studies among current storage systems and query processing approaches in understanding their efficiency. The paper also provides a vision for long-term future research directions by providing highlights on future challenges and opportunities in RDF domain. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The creation and functioning of intelligent robots coalition is impossible without the organization of an information interaction environment between them. To solve this problem, it is proposed to use the concept of cyberphysical framework, which involves the unification of physical and cyber (virtual) environments. Intelligent robots can interact with each of the environments. The paper proposes methodology of the cyber physical smart space creation for the intelligent robots' coalition formation and functioning, based on the concept of the "blackboard" with the support of smart contracts over the blockchain technology. It provides a new approach to the distribution of sensory, computational, information-control and service tasks between intelligent robots, embedded devices, fixed service equipment, cloud computing and information resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is extensively used as an integration means in varies application domains, spanning from the healthcare to the manufacturing, aiming at achieving an easy-to-access and elastic data storage and exchange among heterogeneous and geographically sparse organizations. This cloud-based integration poses crucial security issues related to the data protection from unauthorized access to the outsourced data, which calls for a proper access control solution. However, the heterogeneity among the organizations exacerbates this problem, demanding an interoperable authorization scheme, where multiple access control models must co-exist. The current literature is rich of academic solutions and standards to have an interoperable exchange of security policies and definition of authorization rules, but lacks an effective support to let different access control models to fully coexist. Moreover, the possibility of stealing authentication credentials and authorization claims paves the way to conducting masquerading attacks that cannot be treated by traditional static authorization solutions, but more dynamic approaches are needed. Last but not least, the continuous interaction of users with the cloud over the time has the vulnerability of exposing personal information to malicious adversaries and to let them trace the user activities. In this work, we propose to solve these three issues by having an ontology-based access control solution, to encompass trust within the authorization process and to use pseudonyms to preserve the user privacy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Dengue, also known as break-bone fever, is a tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes. If the similarity between dengue infected users can be identified, it can help government’s health agencies to manage the outbreak more effectively. To find similarity between cases affected by Dengue, user’s personal and health information are the two fundamental requirements. Identification of similar symptoms, causes, effects, predictions and treatment procedures, is important. In this paper, an effective framework is proposed which finds similar patients suffering from dengue using keyword aware domain thesaurus and case base reasoning method. This paper focuses on the use of ontology dependent domain thesaurus technique to extract relevant keywords and then build cases with the help of case base reasoning method. Similar cases can be shared with users, nearby hospitals and health organizations to manage the problem more adequately. Two million case bases were generated to test the proposed similarity method. Experimental evaluations of proposed framework resulted in high accuracy and low error rate for finding similar cases of dengue as compared to UPCC and IPCC algorithms. The framework developed in this paper is for dengue but can easily be extended to other domains also. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The application of high-bandwidth networks and cloud computing in manufacturing systems will be followed by mass data. Industrial data analysis plays important roles in condition monitoring, performance optimization, flexibility, and transparency of the manufacturing system. However, the currently existing architectures are mainly for offline data analysis, not suitable for real-time data processing. In this paper, we first define the smart factory as a cloud-assisted and self-organized manufacturing system in which physical entities such as machines, conveyors, and products organize production through intelligent negotiation and the cloud supervises this self-organized process for fault detection and troubleshooting based on data analysis. Then, we propose a scheme to integrate knowledge reasoning and semantic data where the reasoning engine processes the ontology model with real time semantic data coming from the production process. Based on these ideas, we build a benchmarking system for smart candy packing application that supports direct consumer customization and flexible hybrid production, and the data are collected and processed in real time for fault diagnosis and statistical analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, E-Learning methods, Semantic Web technologies, all have as a purpose the satisfaction of user's needs. Nowadays, the user profile is considered as one of the most important constraint to take into account to perform the accuracy of the results returned by applications and computer systems (personalization and recommendation systems). A user profile is a knowledge related to a specific user, it may be extracted from several sources having different format and, most of time, geographically distributed, this is why, this knowledge need to be collected, predicted, managed, filtered and represented in such away to be exploited. In this paper, we present a survey about the most important works done in this area, by dividing the profiling process into three major steps: modeling, constructing and management user profiles. We'll present the different techniques and methods used in: web, ubiquitous and cloud environment and we'll discuss some of the challenges and the future trends in the user profiling field. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural language semantic construction improves natural language comprehension ability and analytical skills of the machine. It is the basis for realizing the information exchange in the intelligent cloud-computing environment. This paper proposes a natural language semantic construction method based on cloud database, mainly including two parts: natural language cloud database construction and natural language semantic construction. Natural Language cloud database is established on the CloudStack cloud-computing environment, which is composed by corpus, thesaurus, word vector library and ontology knowledge base. In this section, we concentrate on the pretreatment of corpus and the presentation of background knowledge ontology, and then put forward a TF-IDF and word vector distance based algorithm for duplicated webpages (TWDW). It raises the recognition efficiency of repeated web pages. The part of natural language semantic construction mainly introduces the dynamic process of semantic construction and proposes a mapping algorithm based on semantic similarity (MBSS), which is a bridge between Predicate-Argument (PA) structure and background knowledge ontology. Experiments show that compared with the relevant algorithms, the precision and recall of both algorithms we propose have been significantly improved. The work in this paper improves the understanding of natural language semantics, and provides effective data support for the natural language interaction function of the cloud service. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Searchable encryption has become a very important technique for secure data search in cloud systems. It can conduct search functions over encrypted cloud data and protect the data privacy meanwhile. There are many searchable encryption schemes that support basic search functions like single keyword search, multi-keyword search, similiarity search and so on. To enrich the search functionality, several searchable encryption schemes that support semantic search have been proposed recently. However, these schemes only focus on the existence of keywords during the search process. They have not considered the semantic relation between keywords, which have significant influence on the search results. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a new co-occurrence matrix based Semantic Multi-keyword Ranked Search scheme (SMRS) which considers both the semantic relation of keywords and keyword weight for more accurate search results over encrypted cloud data. We design a term co-occurrence matrix to quantize the semantic correlation of keywords and adopt the widely-used TF-IDF rule to measure the keyword weight. In particular, our scheme can effectively retrieve data items that match the users’ intention better. The indexes and queries are encrypted by the secure kNN algorithm. We also add some randomness in the encryption process for stronger protection. Security analysis prove that SMRS is secure under the known background model. The performance evaluation shows that our scheme achieves high search accuracy and practical search efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The fundamental concern of building a distributed Cloud manufacturing (CM) platform is how wide variety of manufacturing services (SaaS, PaaS, HaaS, IaaS) can be integrated under a common cloud platform? More technically, this concern is related to the classical data integration problem, i.e. how to universally map information from heterogeneous data sources. Adoption of CM may become possible if collaborative agents can automatically discover a set of suitable CM services, and invoke them in a particular order to achieve a certain manufacturing task. Cloud computing community suggested semantic web services in order to enable automatic discovery, invocation and orchestration of web services. In this paper, we describe a novel multi-agent framework, where agents are configured based on Belief, Desire, and Intention (BDI) formalism. In this proposed framework, agents are capable of autonomously discovering and orchestrating manufacturing services based on their intrinsic and extrinsic awareness of the manufacturing knowledge at its most contemporary state. The internal structure of agents are constructed by Horn-DL rules, arguing such DL-safe rules will be able to extract and analyze manufacturing knowledge bases, built with OWL-DL. This chapter also introduces a novel method of selecting suitable services, from the intrinsic semantic in Horn-DL rule. This integration of Horn-Dl and semantic cloud services is designed based on a logical extension of Horn-DL. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Virtualization of computational hardware resource has been around for years and it has proved itself as an effective solution, enabling more flexible resource management which supports Cloud computing. Beside the traditional hypervisor-based virtualization, another concept co-exists – container-based virtualization. In container-based virtualization, the virtualization layer runs as an application within the operating system, which is much lighter compared to hypervisor. However, in recent times, there is also tendency to apply a virtualization approach of network resources, due to growth of quantity of data that has to be transmitted and increasing number of mobile and wearable devices, which requires more robust and flexible network management. In networking, two important new concepts have emerged: Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). Both of them enable novel ways of design, implementation, configuration and management of computer networks and show potential of network performance improvement and cost reduction in previously mentioned conditions. In this paper, we focus on Network Functions Virtualization and present a model-driven, semantics-enabled framework for automated, (re-)deployment of containerized Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and generation of SDN OpenFlow and network overlay rules as a result. We decide to use container-based virtualization approach in order to decrease the overhead induced by the hypervisor layer, speed-up the deployment and increase the overall flexibility which is crucial in many novel use cases, especially when it comes to Edge Computing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past couple of years, a new paradigm has emerged which is referred to as DevOps. It is a methodology to efficiently manage the relationship between development and operations in order to automate applications lifecycle. Spurred by its popularity, it is used today to manage applications in the PaaS level of the Cloud. However, it becomes very challenging when it comes to deploying an application in multi-PaaS environments. The first challenge is to discover and select services taking into account the application requirements and on the PaaS capabilities. Indeed, PaaS providers do not use the same mechanisms to describe and expose their services. Added to that, there is no standard way to describe application requirements. To tackle these anomalies, we propose an automatic and declarative approach to discover and select services offered by PaaS providers. It enables developers to express their requirements and PaaS providers to expose their offers in manifests. To do so, a matching algorithm selects the most appropriate offer in terms of PaaS capabilities to deploy the application. An offer may involve either a single or multi-PaaS provider(s). The key ingredients of our solution are threefold: (1) manifests to describe application requirements and the offers, (2) an ontology to remove semantic ambiguities in PaaS providers capabilities, and (3) a matching algorithm to elect the most appropriate offer to the application.The solution is proposed as a REST API and is delivered with a Web client. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, searchable encryption becomes the focus topic with the emerging cloud computing paradigm. The existing research schemes are mainly semantic extensions of multiple keywords. However, the semantic information carried by the keywords is limited and does not respond well to the content of the document. And when the original scheme constructs the conceptual graph, it ignores the context information of the topic sentence, which leads to errors in the semantic extension. In this paper, we define and construct semantic search encryption scheme for context-based conceptual graph (ESSEC). We make contextual contact with the central key attributes in the topic sentence and extend its semantic information, so as to improve the accuracy of the retrieval and semantic relevance. Finally, experiments based on real data show that the scheme is effective and feasible. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The fast evolution of IT services and the shift from server-centred applications to widely distributed frameworks and platforms, of which cloud computing is the best representative, have highly conditioned the way enterprise managers deal with their businesses. Several tools for the design and execution of business processes have been proposed, together with standards for their formal representation, such as BPMN. Despite the expressivity of such tools and representations, there is still a lack of integration with cloud services, mostly due to the high variety of currently available offers, which creates confusion among customers. Moreover, portability and interoperability issues tend to hinder the adoption of cloud solutions for the immediate deployment of business processes. In order to overcome such issues and support the adoption of cloud services for the deployment of business processes, in this paper, a semantic approach is proposed. The presented representation aims at easing the mapping process and to suggest users the best suitable cloud services to compose. A case study which demonstrates the applicability and efficacy of the approach is also described. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rise of cloud computing started a transition for software applications from local to remote infrastructures. This migration created an opportunity to aggregate and consolidate analogous data content. However, this data content usually come with very different data structures and data terminologies and is usually tightly coupled to one or more applications. With these disparities and restrictions, the analogous data ends up both centrally stored but spread over several disconnected heterogeneous data sources. In this article, we present an approach to aggregate data sources using live data consolidation. The approach preserves the original data sources; and by doing so, prevents associated applications from having to migrate to a new data source. The approach uses an ontology at its core to serve as a common semantic ground between data sources and leverage its stored knowledge to expand query capabilities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Estimating future runtime performance and cost is an essential task for Chief Information Officers in deciding whether to adopt a Cloud-based system. Benchmarking and simulation are two techniques that have long been practiced towards reliable estimation. Benchmarking involves (potentially) high cost and time consumption, but oftentimes yields more reliable estimates than simulation, while the simulation is much cheaper and faster than benchmarking, but less reliable. In order to deal with this dichotomy, we propose a complementary approach to estimating the performance of Cloud-based systems, whereby performance estimates can be obtained in a fast, inexpensive, and also reliable way. In this approach, the ontological concepts of a benchmark model, whose benchmark results have already been obtained, are mapped into those of a simulation model, while the mismatches and similarities between the two models are taken care of, through measures of similarity between the two. This ontology-driven construction of simulation models is intended not only to yield more reliable simulation results but also to help better explain why the simulation results may, or may not, be reliable. To validate our complementary approach, simulation models are constructed using CloudSim, and the simulation results are compared against the corresponding benchmark results, by using our prototype tool, collected from Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Compute Engine (GCE) by using the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) tool. These experiments show that the simulation results show about 90% accuracy with respect to the benchmark results, and additionally we feel we could better explain why this happens. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Services in cloud computing run under specified constraints defined in Service Level Agreement (sLA) which becomes the basic core that guarantee the Quality of Service (Qos). However, the ambiguity in agreement terms makes the consumer face new challenges especially in understanding and analyzing sLA document. These challenges increasingly rise when the consumer uses Services from multiple providers; since each one has its own sLA terminology. In this paper, we have significantly automated the process of managing and analyzing cloud sLA using Semantic web technologies like OWL (Ontology Web Language), sWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) and sQWRL (Semantic Query-Enhanced Web Rule Language). We describe the cloud sLA modeling and analyzing approach that assists consumers automatically analyze terms of various sLA documentS. A prototype implementation demonstrates the feasibility and the efficiency of our approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Small and medium enterprise systems need to be preserved which is a necessity for our country as the growth is at the grass roots levels. Cloud computing can be a solution to help preserve the small and medium enterprises by promoting their services through the web as they can avoid huge infrastructure costs. However, most of the enterprise practitioners are not technology savvy, and it will be a daunting task to choose the best select service provider from the vast number of cloud service providers present. Hence, in this paper a comprehensive three-pronged technique which will facilitate the easy selection of cloud service providers is proposed. An interval valued fuzzy soft sets algorithm is used to rank the cloud service providers based on the user ratings of the cloud service providers. The information regarding the cloud service providers has been collected to create ontology to match the service providers with user requirements. This suite of tools can be used by the enterprise owners to select the best cloud service provider for their requirements with minimum IT knowledge. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ontologies are considered a backbone for supporting advanced situation management in various smart domains, particularly smart health. It plays a vital role in understanding user context in order to determine patients' safety, situation identification accuracy, and provide personalized comfort. The smart health domain contains a huge number of different types of context profiles related to interactive devices, linked health objects, and smart-home. The key role of context profiles is to deduce urgent situations that are needed to run adaptation components on a specific smarthealth Fog. Existing platforms and middlewares lack support to efficiently analyze a large number of heterogeneous specific profiles and continuous context changing in near real time. In this paper, we focus on data and dissemination of information from services related to the field of e-health. This paper aims to provide a new generic user situation-aware profile ontology (GUSP-Onto) for a semantic description of heterogeneous users' profiles with efficient patients' situation management and health multimedia information dissemination related to smart health services. Based on the users' situation management ontology, a two-layered architecture was proposed. The first layer is used to achieve a quality diagnosis of urgent situations including a smart fog computing enhanced with semantic profile modeling that offers efficient situation management. The second layer allows a more in-depth situation analysis for patients and enhanced rich services using cloud computing that provides good scalability. The most innovative of this architecture is the potential benefits from the semantic representation to conduct emergency situation knowledge reasoning and ultimately realize early service selection and adaptation process. The experimental results show a decreased time response and an enhanced accuracy of the proposed approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Security challenges are the most important obstacles for the advancement of IT-based on-demand services and cloud computing as an emerging technology. Lack of coincidence in identity management models based on defined policies and various security levels in different cloud servers is one of the most challenging issues in clouds. In this paper, a policy-based user authentication model has been presented to provide a reliable and scalable identity management and to map cloud users’ access requests with defined polices of cloud servers. In the proposed schema several components are provided to define access policies by cloud servers, to apply policies based on a structural and reliable ontology, to manage user identities and to semantically map access requests by cloud users with defined polices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - On demand provisioning with an acceptable pricing scheme of cloud computing attracts user to enter in to the cloud arena. In this paradigm, there are many cloud service providers involved to offer different level of services and the effectiveness of the service specification, identification of services is always a challenging one. Hence, we propose a broker based cloud computing framework for enabling the cloud user to specify their service requirements in terms of numerical representation. The infrastructure type of services such as computing and storage are considered for this proposal. With respect to the user specification, the proposed broker constructs the cloud ontology to represent the available services from the service repository. With the aid of ontological representation, the proposed broker discovers the infrastructure services from the available vendor. The appropriate services are represented using semantic network which enables the user to know about the available services as per their posted requirements. Finally, the broker recommends the services with its add-on features to the cloud users. A prototype model is developed to simulate the functioning of the broker based service discovery in the cloud and the results show the performance upgradation by comparing the traditional approach. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In Discrete Event System, such as railway onboard system, overwhelming volume of textual data is recorded in the form of repair verbatim collected during the fault diagnosis process. Efficient text mining of such maintenance data plays an important role in discovering the best-practice repair knowledge from millions of repair verbatims, which help to conduct accurate fault diagnosis and predication. This paper presents a text case-based reasoning framework by cloud computing, which uses the diagnosis ontology for annotating fault features recorded in the repair verbatim. The extracted fault features are further reduced by rough set theory. Finally, the case retrieval is employed to search the best-practice repair actions for fixing faulty parts. By cloud computing, rough set-based attribute reduction and case retrieval are able to scale up the Big Data records and improve the efficiency of fault diagnosis and predication. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a fault diagnosis of train onboard equipment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Linked Data (LD) technology enables integrating information across disparate sources and can be exploited to perform inferencing for deriving added-value knowledge. As such, it can really support performing different kinds of analysis tasks over business process (BP) execution related information. When moving BPs in the cloud, giving rise to Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) concept, the first main challenge is to collect and link, based on a certain structure, information originating from different systems. To this end, two main ontologies are proposed in this paper to enable this structuring: a KPI and a Dependency one. Then, via exploiting these well-connected ontologies, an innovative Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis system is built that offers two main analysis capabilities: KPI assessment and drill-down, where the second can enable finding root causes of KPI violations. This system advances the state-of-the-art by exhibiting the capability, through the LD usage, of the flexible construction and assessment of any KPI kind, allowing experts to better explore the possible KPI space. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The current problem in cloud services discovery is the lack of standardisation in the naming convention and the heterogeneous type of its features. Therefore, to accurately retrieve the appropriate services, an intelligent service discovery is required. To do that, the cloud services attributes should be extracted from the heterogeneous formats and represented it in a uniform manner such as ontology to increase the accuracy of discovery. The extraction process can be done by classifying the cloud services into different types. In this paper, single and multiple phases-based classifications are performed using support vector machine (SVM) and naïve Bayes as classifiers. The Cloud Armor's dataset used which represents four classes of cloud services. Topic modelling using MALLET tool is used for dataset pre-processing. The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy for the two phases-based and single phase-based classifications reached 87.90% and 92.78% respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The exponential evolution of technology and the environment surrounding the information systems (IS) forces companies to act quickly to follow the trend of business workflows with the use of high computer technologies and well adapted to the needs of the market. Currently, the performance of information system is considered a problem, we must intervene to make them more agile and responsive to better support the strategy of the company. The exchange and communication is a must between information systems to address these issues and new requirements, businesses are looking to integrate and interact even their information systems to interconnect applications. Interoperability is essential between information systems, it promotes alignment between the company's business strategy and IT strategy while respecting the existing technical heritage of the company. The interoperability solutions between information systems face major problems since the SI is independently developed and designed differently and that solutions must meet certain criteria, namely, autonomy, scalability and resolve trade problems of data. The MDA approach is the most suitable solution to our problem because it ensures a degree of independence between the logic the company's business and technology platform. Moreover, oriented architecture SOA service is used in this sense, it encapsulates the components of the information system into editable and reusable service. We want through this article to contribute to the development of a model for interoperability of several different IS, founded on a middleware layer compound of services according to the architecture SOA. The special feature of our model is that it uses an ontological database in the Cloud that will store concepts exchanged among interconnected IS and uses several transformation layers, integration, homogenization and adapting services. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyber Physical Social Systems (CPSS) has been rapidly developing in recent years because of the dramatic growth of mobile techniques and Internet-based technologies. As an emerging novel technical paradigm, cloud computing is becoming an efficient mechanism that has been broadly implemented in multiple fields with using Internet-enabled devices. Telehealth system is one of the crucial domains in applications of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), which is also considered an important component in smart city. However, Personalized Cloud-based Telehealth (PCTH) is still facing a great challenge due to restrictions deriving from various perspectives, such as cloud resource allocations and real-time information transfers. This paper concentrates on the issue of optimizing the performance of the resource allocation for achieving smart tele-health with obtaining and analyzing real-time data within the dynamic application environment in cloud computing. The dynamic data environment is mainly associated with social connections generated by physicians or health organizations. Along with this focus, we propose a novel approach, entitled Smart Cloud-based Telehealth Cyber Physical Social Systems (SCT-CPSS), to enable mobile CPSS to offer users a real-time health information service based on the social networking behaviors and inputs. Main algorithms used in this proposed mechanism include Real-Time Matching with Dynamic Programming Algorithm (RTM-DPA) and Monte Carlo-based Real-Time Analysis Algorithm (MC-RTAA). Our experiment examination has evaluated the performance of the proposed paradigm. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - For more than a decade, languages such as WSDL, SA-WSDL, OWL-S and others have been proposed to tackle the problem of service description. These service description languages do not take into account key aspects of cloud computing. Inherent features such as interaction techniques between entities, service-level agreement or pricing are necessary when defining a cloud computing service. Regarding cloud data mining services, specific issues of experimentation and the execution process should be included, among others. Following the Linked Data proposal, it is possible to design a specification for the exchange of data mining services and achieve the highest level of interoperability. In this paper we propose a schema of definition of data mining service in cloud computing using Linked Data and validate its operation by defining a complete service. Our proposal is suitable for fully defining data mining services in a comprehensive approach, including all aspects associated with an on-demand cloud service. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, due to global economic downfall, many of the organisations have resorted to downsizing their Information Technology (IT) expenses by adopting innovative computing models like cloud computing, which allows business houses to reduce their fixed IT costs by promising a greener, scalable, cost-effective alternative to utilise the IT resources. A growing number of pay-peruse cloud services are now available on the web in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). With the increase in the number of services, there has also been an increase in demand and adoption of cloud services making cloud service identification and discovery a challenging task. This is due to varied service, descriptions, non-standardised naming conventions, heterogeneity in type and features of cloud services. Thus, selecting an appropriate cloud service according to consumer requirements is a daunting task, especially for applications that use a composition of different cloud services. In this paper, we have designed an ontology-based cloud infrastructure service discovery and selection system that defines functional and non-functional concepts, attributes and relations of infrastructure services. We have shown how the system enables one to discover appropriate services optimally as requested by consumers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Interoperability and easier migration between offered serviced are aims that can be supported by cloud service brokerage in the cloud service ecosystem. We present here a multi-cloud storage broker, implemented as an API. This API allows objects and collections of objects to be stored and retrieved uniformly across a range of cloud-based storage providers. This in turn realizes improved portability and easy migration of software systems between providers and services. Our multi-cloud storage abstraction is implemented as a Java-based multi-cloud storage API and supports a range of storage providers including GoogleDrive, DropBox, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services as sample service providers. We focus on the architectural aspects of the broker in this paper. The abstraction provided by the broker is based on a layered ontological framework. While many multi-cloud applications exist, we investigate in more detail the mapping of the layered ontology onto a design pattern-based organisation of the architecture. This software architecture perspective allows us to show how this satisfies important maintainability and extensibility properties for any software system. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, online reviews have become one of the most useful sources upon which cloud users can rely on to construct their purchasing decisions. This widespread adoption of online reviews results in nourishing the online opinion-based information. Analyzing and studying this kind of information help considerably in the fastidious task of cloud user decision-making. The contribution of this volume can be divided into two major parts: (i) a new opinion mining based cloud service analysis approach for the cloud service selection purpose. The proposed approach extracts and classifies user opinions from online reviews according to each cloud service property and (ii) an Opinion based cloud service ontology to effectively detect cloud service properties from reviews based on Service Measurement Index (SMI) metrics. To illustrate the proposed approach, we develop some experiments and we present the relevant results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence of uncertainty as an inherent aspect of RDF and linked data has spurred a number of works of both theoretical and practical interest These works aim to incorporate such information in a meaningful way in the computation of queries. In this paper, we propose a framework of query evaluation in the presence of uncertainty, based on probabilistic automata, which are simple yet efficient computational models. We showcase this method on relevant examples, where we show how to construct and exploit the convenient properties of such automata to evaluate RDF queries with adjustable cutoff. Finally, we present some directions for further investigation on this particular line of research, taking into account possible generalizations of this work. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) supports life-science research throughout the world by providing open data, open-source software and analytical tools, and technical infrastructure (https://www.ebi.ac.uk). We accommodate an increasingly diverse range of data types and integrate them, so that biologists in all disciplines can explore life in ever-increasing detail. We maintain over 40 data resources, many of which are run collaboratively with partners in 16 countries (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services). Submissions continue to increase exponentially: our data storage has doubled in less than two years to 120 petabytes. Recent advances in cellular imaging and single-cell sequencing techniques are generating a vast amount of high-dimensional data, bringing to light new cell types and new perspectives on anatomy. Accordingly, one of our main focus areas is integrating high-quality information from bioimaging, biobanking and other types of molecular data. This is reflected in our deep involvement in Open Targets, stewarding of plant phenotyping standards (MIAPPE) and partnership in the Human Cell Atlas data coordination platform, as well as the 2017 launch of the Omics Discovery Index. This update gives a birds-eye view of EMBL-EBI's approach to data integration and service development as genomics begins to enter the clinic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - PaaS is a Cloud computing service that provides a computing platform to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of infrastructure maintenance. SMEs are reluctant to enter the growing PaaS market due to the possibility of being locked in to a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants. The PaaSport Marketplace aims to avoid the provider lock-in problem by allowing Platform provider SMEs to roll out semantically interoperable PaaS offerings and Software SMEs to deploy or migrate their applications on the best-matching offering, through a thin, non-intrusive Cloud broker. In this paper, we present the PaaSport semantic model, namely an OWL ontology, extension of the DUL ontology. The ontology is used for semantically representing (a) PaaS offering capabilities and (b) requirements of applications to be deployed. The ontology has been designed to optimally support a semantic matchmaking and ranking algorithm that recommends the best-matching PaaS offering to the application developer. The DUL ontology offers seamless extensibility, since both PaaS Characteristics and parameters are defined as classes; therefore, extending the ontology with new characteristics and parameters requires the addition of new specialized subclasses of the already existing classes, which is less complicated than adding ontology properties. The PaaSport ontology is evaluated through verification tools, competency questions, human experts, application tasks and query performance tests. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing represents an evolution paradigm that enables information technology (IT) capabilities to be delivered “as a service”. In the last decade number of cloud-based services has grown intensely and rapidly. The diversification of cloud service providers has generated the diversification of their offers. Therefore, end-users face a huge challenge while choosing the appropriate cloud provider. Furthermore, the battle for dominance between the big vendors, like Amazon, Google and Salesforce, makes them reluctant to agree on widely accepted standards promoting their own incompatible formats, thus increases the lock-in effect and affects the competition. Interoperability is the missing element that will recover this situation and allows switch between cloud providers whenever needed without setting data and applications at risk. In this paper, we present an approach that will help strengthen semantic and technical interoperability of services. The approach presents a Cloud Community that acts as a broker to mediate between service providers and service consumers based on web ontology language OWLS. This concept would enable end users to select the right services and compose services across multiple Clouds. It would, also, to provide cloud arbitration services that allow users to shift and to choose between existing platforms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - By migrating their data and operations to the cloud, enterprises are able to gain significant benefits in terms of cost savings, increased availability, agility and productivity. Yet, the shared and on-demand nature of the cloud paradigm introduces a new breed of security threats that generally deter stakeholders from relinquishing control of their critical assets to third-party cloud providers. One way to thwart these threats is to instill suitable access control policies into cloud services that protect these assets. Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of cloud environments calls for policies that are able to incorporate a potentially complex body of contextual knowledge. This complexity is further amplified by the interplay that inevitably occurs between the different policies, as well as by the dynamically-evolving nature of an organisation’s business and security needs. We argue that one way to tame this complexity is to devise a generic framework that facilitates the governance of policies. This paper presents a particular aspect of such a framework, namely an approach to determining the repercussions that policy retirement actions have on the overall protection of critical assets in the cloud. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the considerable benefits of cloud computing as an emerging technology, there are some reliability and privacy concerns such as generating and managing access policies according to sensitivity of stored data in cloud storages. The most challenging issue in current information policy models is managing security levels, mapping between access requests and defined policies and considering the flexibility and scalability of this management schema according to the characteristics of cloud computing models. Accordingly, an efficient token-based access model has been presented in this paper to provide a semantic mapping between access requests of cloud users and defined policies and sub-policies of cloud customers according to the authentication and access management protocols of protection ontology. Furthermore, a policy-based session token has been introduced to enhance the reliability of access, decrease the time of mapping by eliminating un-necessary mapping from checked policies and decrease data overhead of by classification of policies and sub-policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The semantic web aims to describe information in terms of well-defined vocabularies and comprehends both data and knowledge to cope with meaning of data. Advanced search engines are used to retrieve precise information out of these knowledge resources. The main challenge is not only retrieving data but also how to keep data safe and protected against any form of attacks. In this paper, we propose a security aware based model for semantic search engines. Our work aims to combine advances in information technology, such as cloud technology, while addressing security issues which threaten the integrity of information. In particular security gaps and countermeasures of the semantic web are identified. ISO/IEC security requirements for the protection of personally identifiable information (PII) are presented to cover security vulnerabilities of the proposed model. Finally, the feasibility of our proposed model is checked against the N2Sky use case, a multi-cloud knowledge information management system for the computational intelligence community. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we present our approach for the cognition of driving context in a connected and semiautonomous vehicle. This cyber-physical vehicle has three main components: the embedded system, the networking and real-time system, and the intelligent system that communicate with each other via Cloud computing infrastructure. This paper is about the functionalities of the intelligent system in the cognition of driving context and the actions that it invokes for each of these driving situations. The driving context is determined as a result of the fusion of various parameters representing the context of the environment, the vehicle and the driver. The fission process yields the action that must be implemented with regards to the driving situation in consideration. Ontology is used as a tool for knowledge representation. This work is a contribution to safe driving in a connected and semi-autonomous vehicle. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We argue that cloud service brokerage (CSB) mechanisms can strengthen the resilience of services in cloud-based VEs. In this respect, we present the Service Completeness-Compliance Checker (SC3), a mechanism which offers capabilities with respect to the quality assurance dimension of CSB. More specifically, the SC3 strengthens the resilience of cloud services by evaluating their conformance with pre-specified policies concerning the business aspects of their delivery, as well as by managing the evolution of their lifecycle in a controlled and policy-based manner. By relying on an ontology-based representation of policies and services, the SC3 achieves a proper separation of concerns between policy definition and policy enforcement. This effectively enables the SC3 to operate in a manner generic and agnostic to any underlying cloud delivery platform, as well as to reason about the well-formedness of the pre-specified policies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In practice, search keywords have quite different importance when users take search operations. In addition, such keywords may have a certain grammatical relationship among them, which reflect the importance of keywords from the user's perspective intuitively. However, the existing search techniques regard the search keywords as independent and unrelated. In this paper, for the first time, we take the relation among query keywords into consideration and design a keyword weighting algorithm to show the importance of the distinction among them. By introducing the keyword weight to the search protocol design, the search results will be more in line with the user's demand. On top of this, we further design a novel central keyword semantic extension ranked scheme. By extending the central query keyword instead of all keywords, our scheme makes a good tradeoff between the search functionality and efficiency. To better express the relevance between queries and files, we further introduce the TF-IDF rule when building trapdoors and the index. In particular, our scheme supports both data set and keywords updates by using the sub-matrix technique. Our work first gives a basic idea for the design of the central keyword semantic extension ranked scheme, and then presents two secure searchable encryption schemes to meet different privacy requirements under two different threat models. Experiments on the real-world data set show that our proposed schemes are efficient, effective, and secure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Information resource services are the key element for resource sharing in cloud manufacturing. Traditional resource service models focus on modeling the attributes, interfaces, and descriptions of the resources into resource information services. Such resource services are suitable for local environment but suffer semantic heterogeneities in open cloud environment. Recently, well-designed ontologies are applied in resource service models to unify the schema and eliminate the semantic heterogeneities among the services. However, the effectiveness of ontology-based models mainly depends on the expertise of the ontology experts in ontology designing. Moreover, it is difficult to catch the dynamic changes in the cloud once the ontology has been embedded. In this paper, a semantic model is presented for information resource service modeling that uses semantic links instead of ontologies. The model takes advantage of semantic links to enable automated integrating and distributed updating in resource service cloud. In the experiment, the model is applied on practical manufacturing resources from a wheel manufacturing company. The case study and experimental results show that the proposed model is suitable for modeling manufacturing resources into cloud services and enables the flexible and distributed manipulation on resource services in the cloud environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, researches focus on addressing the query bottleneck issue using semantic cache. However, the challenges of this method are how to increase cache hit ratio, decrease the query processing time, and address cache consistency issue. In this paper, we construct segment access-aware dynamic semantic cache for relational databases. Some definitions of semantic segment, probe query, and remainder query are proposed to describe the semantic cache. Then, estimation of the query result is proposed. Next, cache access algorithm of our proposed segment access-aware dynamic semantic cache is presented in case of cache exact hit, cache extended hit, cache partial hit and cache miss. Cache item with effective lifecycle tag is proposed to address cache consistency issue. Finally, experimental results show that this approach performs better than regular semantic cache and decisional semantic cache. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

However, relinquishing control of sensitive medical data by delegating their storage and processing to third-party cloud providers naturally raises significant security concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise appropriate policies that infuse adequate access controls in cloud services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of these services, coupled with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinder the formulation of effective and interoperable policies that are appropriate for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work adopts the ontological templates proposed in [5] for the representation of access control policies in the medical sector. By capturing the knowledge that must be infused into an access control policy, these templates sufficiently address the needs of the underlying domain of application in which such a policy is to be enforced; at the same time, they facilitate developers in infusing adequate access controls to their cloud applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the development of an open-source information system, called Asclepios, which manages a plethora of information on communicable diseases in an agile manner. Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily. The application of Asclepios is wide ranging - from military to Government through to medical and tourism and pharmaceuticals. Further, Asclepios-like applications are very much needed in most Third world countries, including all countries in Africa, as it can significantly enhance the health, safety and well-being of people. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Smart factory addresses the vertical integration of physical entities and information systems. Network and cloud are two essential infrastructures to achieve this goal. Among them, the network provides interconnection for communication and data flow, while the cloud provides powerful and elastic computing and storage abilities for big data and intelligent applications. This paper presents a cloud-centric framework for the implementation of the smart factory. Based on this framework, three high leveled protocols viz., EtherCAT, DDS, and OPC UA are selected to implement machine network (controller to sensors/actuators communication), machine to machine communication, and machine to cloud communication respectively, to satisfy diverse communication requirements of the smart factory. An integrated architecture for combining ontology knowledge and semantic data to support intelligent applications is also proposed. These network and data process schemes are verified in a smart factory prototype for personalized candy packing application. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, cloud services have been providing a wide source of information and yet the expansion of these services has led to their own particular problems in this subject. Discovering of the appropriate resources or services is a major challenge in the cloud computing. Therefore, many methods are proposed to tackle this problem. Also, in the cloud environments, ontology is a description of the concepts and relationships that can exist for a cloud service or group of services. On the other hand, for a certain item, user's interest according to the information of their profiles are predicted by collaborative filtering. It uses a collection of users with similar interests to predict interesting information for target users. However, despite the importance of the semantic relations among the cloud services, a few papers consider these relations to discover the proper resources. Therefore, this paper aims at proposing a method to discover the cloud services via semantic concepts and collaborative filtering. The obtained results from experiments have illustrated that the presented approach improves the efficiency of service discovery in the cloud computing and obtains fewer execution times against the current approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is a pattern for delivering ubiquitous and on demand computing resources based on pay-as-you-use financial model. Typically, cloud providers advertise cloud service descriptions in various formats on the Internet. On the other hand, cloud consumers use available search engines (Google and Yahoo) to explore cloud service descriptions and find the adequate service. Unfortunately, general purpose search engines are not designed to provide a small and complete set of results, which makes the process a big challenge. This paper presents a generic-distrusted framework for cloud services marketplace to automate cloud services discovery and selection process, and remove the barriers between service providers and consumers. Additionally, this work implements two instances of generic framework by adopting two different matching algorithms; namely dominant and recessive attributes algorithm borrowed from gene science and semantic similarity algorithm based on unified cloud service ontology. Finally, this paper presents unified cloud services ontology and models the real-life cloud services according to the proposed ontology. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a cloud services marketplace where cloud providers and cloud consumers can trend cloud services as utilities. In comparison with existing work, semantic approach reduced the execution time by 20% and maintained the same values for all other parameters. On the other hand, dominant and recessive attributes approach reduced the execution time by 57% but showed lower value for recall. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Content delivery through cloud networks has gained popularity due to the cloud's ability to provide on-demand services. However, composite services, such as customized multimedia content, introduce both delays and resource limitations if traditional cloud solutions are used. With recent advances in mobile edge computing, customized media delivery can be achieved through compositions of service specific overlays (SSOs). This paper presents a workflow-net-based mechanism for mobile edge node cooperation in fog-cloud networks to form guaranteed SSOs. The proposed solution uses a mathematical cooperation operator to turn the SSO composition problem expressed as workflow nets into algebraic representations. In turn, the minimal cost cooperative path from the workflow net is determined such that it guarantees the delivery of the requested composite media services to clients. Experimental results show that the composition process can be adequately established and carried out in a timely manner. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the advent of cloud computing, more and more consumers prefer to use the cloud services with the pay-as-you-consume mode. The cloud storage brings about great convenience to users, who store data in cloud and access to it using the smart devices anytime and anywhere. Consumers' information should be encrypted to guarantee the data privacy. Flexible searching on ciphertext is a critical challenge to be solved for effective data utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic keyword searchable proxy re-encryption scheme for secure cloud storage. A highlight of this work is that the scheme is quantum attack resistant, while most of the available searchable encryption schemes are not. It supports not only exact keyword search but also synonym keyword search. Moreover, the data owner is capable to delegate his search right to another user using the proxy re-encryption mechanism. In the generation process of re-encryption key, the delegator and delegatee do not need to be interactive with each other. The scheme is also collusion resistant. Under the learning with errors hardness problem, this scheme is proved secure in standard model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In a Smart City is required computational platforms, which allow environments with multiple interconnected and embedded systems, where the technology is integrated with the people, and can respond to unpredictable situations. One of the biggest challenges in developing Smart City is how to describe and dispose of enormous and multiple sources of information, and how to share and merge it into a single infrastructure. In previous works, we have proposed an Autonomic Reflective Middleware with emerging and ubiquitous capabilities, which is based on intelligent agents that can be adapted to the existing dynamism in a city for, ubiquitously, respond to the requirements of citizens, using emerging ontologies that allow the adaptation to the context. In this work, we extend this middleware using the fog computing paradigm, to solve this problem. The fog extends the cloud to be closer to the things that produce and act on the smart city. In this paper, we present the extension to the middleware, and examples of utilization in different situations in a smart city. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to employ technology–function based patent analysis to identify the important technologies of cloud computing. This study exploits the Stanford parser and association rule to extract and separate the information concerning technologies and functions from patent text. Based on the results of the technology–function matrix, this study employs technology network analysis to investigate technology change. Moreover, this study proposes a technology–function matrix analysis diagram (TFMAD) and applies the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to identify the most important technologies of cloud computing. Among the three classes of cloud computing, infrastructure as a service has the largest number of patents and the connections between patents are close, but the platform as a service has the highest patent growth rate. Based on the analysis of TFMAD, this study shows that technological developments related to computing device and virtual machines are of particular importance to the cloud computing industry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, cloud computing paradigm has attracted a lot of attention from both industry and academia. However, each cloud provider uses its own techniques (languages, standards, ontologies, or models, etc.) to describe cloud services. The diversity of these techniques leads to the vendor lock-in problem, and thus, the lack of a cloud service description standardization. In addition, existing service descriptions cover only particular aspects and neglect others. For example, WSDL covers only technical aspect and does not cover business and semantic ones. Our objective is to define a standardized cloud service description that covers technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. In this paper, we introduce different approaches that have dealt with cloud service description, and thus, we adopt USDL language as an appropriate technique to describe cloud services thanks to its expressivity by covering three perspectives (technical, operational, and business). But, USDL is still limited because it cannot cover semantic aspect and it is not intended for cloud computing domain. After that, we highlight USDL limitations that can appear in cloud computing domain and that should be taken into consideration in our research work. This paper will focus on establishing a WSMO-based ontology to define semantically cloud services. This new cloud service description is based on USDL and we will enhance it by taking into consideration some USDL limitations. Finally, we test our proposed cloud service description model on a case study to prove its applicability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The cloud computing paradigm enables enterprises to realise significant cost savings whilst boosting their agility and productivity. However, security and privacy concerns generally deter enterprises from migrating their critical data to the cloud. One way to alleviate these concerns, hence bolster the adoption of cloud computing, is to devise adequate security policies that control the manner in which these data are stored and accessed in the cloud. Nevertheless, for enterprises to entrust these policies, a framework capable of providing assurances about their correctness is required. This work proposes such a framework. In particular, it proposes an approach that enables enterprises to define their own view of what constitutes a correct policy through the formulation of an appropriate set of well-formedness constraints. These constraints are expressed ontologically thus enabling-by virtue of semantic inferencing-automated reasoning about their satisfaction by the policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - By embracing the cloud computing paradigm enterprises are able to boost their agility and productivity whilst realising significant cost savings. However, many enterprises are reluctant to adopt cloud services for supporting their critical operations due to security and privacy concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise policies that infuse suitable security controls in cloud services. This work proposes a class of ontologically-expressed rules, namely the so-called axiomatic rules, that aim at ensuring the correctness of these policies by harnessing the various knowledge artefacts that they embody. It also articulates an adequate framework for the expression of policies, one which provides ontological templates for modelling the knowledge artefacts encoded in the policies and which form the basis for the proposed axiomatic rules. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Temporal information retrieval tasks have a long history in information retrieval field and also have attracted neuroscientists working on memory system. It becomes more important in Semantic Web where structured data in RDF triples, often with temporal information, are rapidly accumulated over time. Existing triple stores already support loading RDF triples and answering a given SPARQL query with time interval constraints. However, few triple stores has been optimized for processing time interval queries which are important for temporal information retrieval tasks. In this paper, we propose xStore, a federated SPARQL engine running on a cloud environment, which supports a fast processing of temporal queries. xStore is built on top of heterogeneous storages such as key-value stores and conventional triple stores. Experiments over real-world temporal datasets showed that our approach is faster than a conventional SPARQL engine for processing temporal queries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Various prior studies have leveraged cloud computing and big data techniques to promote adaptive micro open learning. However, this novel way of open education resource (OER) delivery and access suffers from the cold start problem of learner information. In this paper, we introduce a service oriented solution to assist OER providers and instructors to deal with the sparsity of data in OER recommendation using an ontological approach. Learners' features are predicted by spreading activation and demographic similarity based inference. An evolutionary algorithm is provided to realize the OER recommendation in terms of heuristic rules. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Service Level Agreement (SLA) is gaining more and more interest since the dynamic aspect of the cloud computing can adversely influence the guarantee of the Quality of Service (QoS). Proving an SLA violation is considered to be a complex operation to the cloud consumer. This task gets more and more difficult to the consumers as they use services from multiple providers, each with its own monitoring policies. In order to implicitly help the consumer monitor the SLA and detect violations, it is necessary to implement some advanced SLA management strategies. Ontological representation and reasoning techniques in SLA management may be beneficial to the evaluation of the QoS. In this regard, we propose a monitoring approach with a new semantic SLA modeling for cloud computing. Our approach aims to help cloud consumers monitor the SLA documents and detect violations by considering the semantic meaning of SLA concepts and taking profit from the power of reasoning techniques. This maintains a reliable QoS and respects the SLA parameters. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in this paper through a simulation and a case study. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With continuously growing data, clusters also need to grow periodically to accommodate the increased demand of data processing. This is usually done by addition of newer hardware, whose configuration might differ from the existing nodes. As a result, clusters are becoming heterogeneous in nature. For many real world machine learning and data mining applications, data is represented in the form of graphs. Most of the existing distributed graph processing frameworks such as Pregel and Graphlab assume that the computational nodes are homogeneous. These frameworks split the graph into approximately equal subgraphs, which is appropriate for homogeneous clusters. In heterogeneous clusters, these frameworks perform poorly in most of the scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, GraphIVE is the only heterogeneity-aware graph processing framework. It learns the relative capabilities of the nodes based on runtime metrics of previous jobs and partitions the graph proportionally. However, it may not perform well if a new job differs drastically in terms of resource requirements when compared to previous jobs executed on the cluster. To overcome this limitation, we propose GraphSteal, a dynamic graph re-partitioning policy for vertex-cut based graph processing frameworks on heterogeneous clusters. GraphSteal dynamically re-partitions the graph based on the runtime characteristics of the job. To avoid computational skew in the cluster, it migrates edges from slow nodes to fast nodes. To demonstrate our approach, we modify the source code of Graphlab to incorporate dynamic graph re-partitioning strategy. Experimental results show that GraphSteal significantly improves the performance over Graphlab. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the key challenges faced by consumers is to efficiently manage and monitor the quality of cloud services. To manage service performance, consumers have to validate rules embedded in cloud legal contracts, such as Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Privacy Policies, that are available as text documents. Currently this analysis requires significant time and manual labor and is thus inefficient. We propose a cognitive assistant that can be used to manage cloud legal documents by automatically extracting knowledge (terms, rules, constraints) from them and reasoning over it to validate service performance. In this paper, we present this Question and Answering (Q&A) system that can be used to analyze and obtain information from the SLA documents. We have created a knowledgebase of Cloud SLAs from various providers which forms the underlying repository of our Q&A system. We utilized techniques from natural language processing and semantic web (RDF, SPARQL and Fuseki server) to build our framework. We also present sample queries on how a consumer can compute metrics such as service credit. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Platform as a Service is the major productivity enabler in the cloud computing stack. By providing managed and highly automated application environments, it enhances developer productivity and reduces developer operations and maintenance efforts. The market, however, is fast-changing and offerings are differing conceptually as well as in their supported technological ecosystem. Therefore, provider selection is an important but currently not well supported step for companies trying to benefit from the technology. Influenced by the diversity of service offerings and the absence of applied standards this is a tedious task, especially for ensuring application portability. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria selection approach for cloud platforms based on a field-tested ontology and a comprehensive data set. The methodology is enhanced by semantic algorithms and mappings to reduce hidden query and data biases. This allows not only the exact matching of requirements but also the evaluation of possible alternatives that can be adapted to fit the defined requirements. We validate our approach by contrasting real user queries against the results of our semantically enhanced algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Securing their critical documents on the cloud from data threats is a major challenge faced by organizations today. Controlling and limiting access to such documents requires a robust and trustworthy access control mechanism. In this paper, we propose a semantically rich access control system that employs an access broker module to evaluate access decisions based on rules generated using the organizations confidentiality policies. The proposed system analyzes the multi-valued attributes of the user making the request and the requested document that is stored on a cloud service platform, before making an access decision. Furthermore, our system guarantees an end-to-end oblivious data transaction between the organization and the cloud service provider using oblivious storage techniques. Thus, an organization can use our system to secure their documents as well as obscure their access pattern details from an untrusted cloud service provider. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we present an approach to adapt the e-assessment workflow by considering learner's profiles. We have started by creating a learner profile ontology based on extraction data from e-assessment activities, file log and personal information. Then, we have defined three adaptation actions: Add Activity, Edit Activity and Delete Activity, applied on the workflow assessment and using information extracted from learner profile ontology instances. Each action is applied according to conditions. After that, we present some results of the empirical evaluation of our system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Most current security solutions are based on perimeter security. However, Cloud computing breaks the organization perimeters. When data resides in the Cloud, they reside outside the organizational bounds. This leads users to a loos of control over their data and raises reasonable security concerns that slow down the adoption of Cloud computing. Is the Cloud service provider accessing the data? Is it legitimately applying the access control policy defined by the user? This paper presents a data-centric access control solution with enriched role-based expressiveness in which security is focused on protecting user data regardless the Cloud service provider that holds it. Novel identity-based and proxy re-encryption techniques are used to protect the authorization model. Data is encrypted and authorization rules are cryptographically protected to preserve user data against the service provider access or misbehavior. The authorization model provides high expressiveness with role hierarchy and resource hierarchy support. The solution takes advantage of the logic formalism provided by Semantic Web technologies, which enables advanced rule management like semantic conflict detection. A proof of concept implementation has been developed and a working prototypical deployment of the proposal has been integrated within Google services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence of cloud computing infrastructure and Semantic Web technologies has created unprecedented opportunities for composing large-scale business processes and workflow-based applications that span multiple organizational domains. A key challenge related to composition of such multi-organizational business processes and workflows is posed by the security and access control policies of the underlying organizational domains. In this paper, we propose a framework for verifying secure composability of distributed workflows in an autonomous multi-domain environment. The objective of workflow composability verification is to ensure that all the users or processes executing the designated workflow tasks conform to the time-dependent security policy specifications of all collaborating domains. A key aspect of such verification is to determine the time-dependent schedulability of distributed workflows, assumed to be invoked on a recurrent basis. We use a two-step approach for verifying secure workflow composability. In the first step, a distributed workflow is decomposed into domain-specific projected workflows and is verified for conformance with the respective domain's security and access control policy. In the second step, the cross-domain dependencies amongst the workflow tasks performed by different collaborating domains are verified. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Cloud services are becoming an essential part of many organizations. Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The considerable increase in the use of cloud computing and big data solutions requires the use of advanced technologies to ensure data security, privacy and dependability. One of the possible solutions is the use of data anonymization techniques, which performs an important role in data privacy protection. There are several techniques and algorithms to implement data anonymization. However, specifications and guidelines to guide and standardize the use of these resources are needed. These guidelines, called anonymization policies, are considered an important asset in organizations that want to protect their customer personal data. Although the use of data anonymization brings great benefits, there are no clear directions for data anonymization policies, which ends up lim-iting its adoption by companies and organizations. This work presents a generic anonymization policy to be used in cloud and big data platforms. It also presents a draft ontology with explicit formal specifications for data anonymization policies. This ontology has three main intentions: (i) to standardize the use of data anonymization policies; (ii) share common understanding of the structure of data anonymization among people; (iii) enable reuse of data anonymization policies. In this work, an ongoing study case within the EUBra-BIGSEA project will be implemented. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Under the background of cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0, intelligent manufacturing has become an orientation and produced a revolutionary change. Compared with the traditional manufacturing environments, the intelligent manufacturing has the characteristics as highly correlated, deep integration, dynamic integration, and huge volume of data. Accordingly, it still faces various challenges. In this paper, we summarize and analyze the current research status in both domestic and aboard, including industrial big data collection, modeling of the intelligent product lines based on ontology, the predictive diagnosis based on industrial big data, group learning of product line equipment and the product line reconfiguration of intelligent manufacturing. Based on the research status and the problems, we propose the research strategies, including acquisition schemes of industrial big data under the environment of intelligent, ontology modeling and deduction method based intelligent product lines, predictive diagnostic methods on production lines based on deep neural network, deep learning among devices based on cloud supplements and 3-D self-organized reconfiguration mechanism based on the supplements of cloud. In our view, this paper will accelerate the implementation of smart factory. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Security and privacy challenges are the most important obstacles for the advancement of IT-based on-demand services and cloud computing as an emerging technology. To ensure data confidentiality and fine-grained access control in cloud-based environments, stored data and resources needs to be re-encrypted periodically or based on special mechanisms such as revoked user-based or manual re-encryption. Managing the process of re-encryption is a challenging issue that involves many limitations such as time management, resource confidentiality, and level of access. Accordingly, a multi-level re-encryption model based on policy management has been presented in this paper to ensure data security in clouds. The proposed model uses a policy-based ontology to generate, manage and apply re-encryption policies based on the characteristics of resources, sensitivity of data and capabilities of service provider. The results of comprehensive performance and security analysis of proposed model shows this model increases the reliability of re-encryption processes in cloud storages considerably and provides an efficient policy management for re-encryption tasks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing represents a new computing approach that allows creating robust and on-demand services controlled by means of Service Level Agreements (SLA). These documents are generated following a process of negotiation during which the client chooses a subset of clauses among choices predefined by the provider on a 'take it or leave it' basis. However, the heterogeneity between client requests and provider offers may result in inappropriate SLA. In addition, the cloud service context may change over the time which causes a client requirements adjustment and therefore, the SLA remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cloud SLA negotiation and re-negotiation approach that integrate a semantic mapping between client requests and provider offers with the aim of generating a suitable SLA document. Moreover, our approach includes a context-aware system to adapt the SLA throughout reasoning techniques and automatically ensure the re-negotiation. A prototype implementation demonstrates the feasibility and the efficiency of our approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Searchable encryption is an important research area in cloud computing. However, most existing efficient and reliable ciphertext search schemes are based on keywords or shallow semantic parsing, which are not smart enough to meet with users' search intention. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a content-aware search scheme, which can make semantic search more smart. First, we introduce conceptual graphs (CGs) as a knowledge representation tool. Then, we present our two schemes (PRSCG and PRSCG-TF) based on CGs according to different scenarios. In order to conduct numerical calculation, we transfer original CGs into their linear form with some modification and map them to numerical vectors. Second, we employ the technology of multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data as the basis against two threat models and raise PRSCG and PRSCG-TF to resolve the problem of privacy-preserving smart semantic search based on CGs. Finally, we choose a real-world data set: CNN data set to test our scheme. We also analyze the privacy and efficiency of proposed schemes in detail. The experiment results show that our proposed schemes are efficient. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the research and standardization efforts carried out both by academia and commercial enterprises, the composition of existing cloud services which fully satisfy customers’ requirements is still a complex and tricky task. This situation is due to the high number of cloud services currently available on the market, which either expose non-standard interfaces or implement different standards, according to their specific objective. As in the past design patterns have been applied to software design to bring order and help developers in better building, composing and reusing their application, nowadays cloud patterns offer the opportunity to leverage best practices in services composition to ease the design and deployment of cloud-oriented applications. However, due to differences in semantics which affect services’, operations’ and parameters’ descriptions, cloud patterns alone cannot solve the cloud service composition problem. In this paper a methodology for the discovery and composition of cloud services, guided by cloud patterns, is presented. Such a methodology is supported by semantic Web technologies, such as OWL, OWL-S and SPARQL, to solve incongruence between interfaces’ and parameters’ descriptions, and to automatize the whole composition process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a diversity of risk situations for pregnant women resulting in premature birth endangering the newborn's life. The pregnant women are monitored by physicians benefiting their experience in last months of pregnancy to predict certain risks in premature birth. The paper presents a solution to prevent high risk situations, using ontology as support in profiling pregnant women with possible pregnancy risks. Based on ontology and available medical database of one of the largest maternity hospitals in Timisoara (Bega) we create profiles of women focusing on cases with problems and high potential risks, using as tool the open source Protégé for ontology and Visual Studio.Net for the supporting application. The ontology creates links between the characteristics of pregnant women, medical history, disease and possible problems that may occur during pregnancy. The ontology is used in an application stored in cloud to be accessed by physicians from different locations. Based on this information the application creates women profiles matching the risk they may be exposed to. The application is in tests in Bega Hospital. A set of profiles resulting from a knowledge base will show high risk situations, mainly in premature birth cases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the hasty popularity of cloud computing data possessor are stimulated to move their intricate data from local repository to commercially available open cloud. We need to search and retrieve all the files which are semantically linked to the query in addition to the precise identical file in a secured manner. But for protecting sensitive information like military information, personal health documents etc, these documents have to be shielded before moving to cloud; which prevents conventional search methodologies using plain text keyword search. It is essential to use multi k-words in searching and retrieve the documents based on their significance order of k-word by considering the ever rising number of data possessor and documents in cloud. Meanwhile existing approaches only support fuzzy keyword based search but not semantic based search. There are works based on multi keyword ranked search using synonymous queries but not based on semantics. For securing the data in the cloud, we use (Advanced Encryption Standard) AES algorithm to encrypt the data and (Reverse Advanced Encryption Standard) RAES to decrypt the same. We use secured (k-Nearest Neighbour) KNN algorithm to achieve secured search. In order to provide semantic based search we include a tool called wordnet where we perform semantic based analysis of the files and then include secured KNN over the documents and rank them according to their order of relevance primarily using the term and inverse document frequency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing resource has the features of dynamic, heterogeneous, distributed and complexity etc. Meanwhile the numbers of resources and tasks to be scheduled in Cloud are usually variable. This makes the Cloud resource scheduling a complex optimization problem. None of existing Cloud systems is both being an automated scheduling and considering the optimal usage of resources. To address above problems, we propose a Cloud computing resource scheduling strategy using improved Semantic Search Engine (ISSE). SSE is a new type of service search engine developed by Semantic Computing laboratory in University of California, Irvine. It provides Cloud users with a friendly problem-driven interface to automatically schedule resources that would be used to build a solution according to users' requirementsin the aid of semantic information from resources and user requirements. Further we adopt improvedgenetic algorithm(IGA) in SSE to optimize the scheduling so as to obtain the optimal usage of resources. In our proposed IGA there should be a code distant between the selected parents to retain the population diversity and obtain the valid solution. The architecture of our proposed ISSE is presented as well as the process and implementation of IGA. The experiment results show our proposed ISSE is feasible and can reduce about 16% average tasks execution time comparing to the traditional Cloud resource scheduling (TCRS). © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, cloud-assisted body area network (CABAN) technologies have made their entrance in the Smart healthcare field, such as Smart home environment, and play a significant role for healthcare data storage, processing, and efficient decision making. However, currently, the CABAN paradigm in the healthcare domain is facing increasing difficulty in handling the huge amount of sensor data that the body sensor devices generate from diverse Smart home applications. Therefore, the challenging is now timely storing, processing, and analyzing of the sensor data in real time to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the caregivers or Smart home applications. QoS, here, is the capacity to support diverse Smart home applications in healthcare with different priorities, performance, and resource requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast and robust cloud resource allocation model for body sensor devices to ensure QoS for Smart home healthcare applications. We develop the proposed resource allocation algorithm using agent-based modeling (ABM) and ontology. There are few works, which consider ABM and ontology for resource allocation in CABAN platform. Moreover, we used an ABM tool called NetLogo to implement the proposed resource allocation model. The results from the implementation were compared with the results of existing algorithms and found to be promising. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presented a novel approach for document clustering applying cloud technologies for the system's performance issue. It is critical for application service in cloud computing to provide precise information. Ontology servicing is one of the methods to deal with semantic ambiguity and information overload efficiently through appropriate semantic models and semantic technology. This system is the advanced and extended version of the system we have been published before. The experiments reveal that even the testing documents increased; the system may actually be able to produce useful result for text document clustering. In this paper, we propose a cloud service that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching. Our approach has the capability to perform cloud service concepts from cloud service sources. The main idea behind our method is cloud services using an ontology-based technique. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge is a basic requirement in the era of globalization. The act of acquiring knowledge is learning and with the advent of technology, learning has become easier. E-Learning is a popular learning method which uses the web or other technologies to promote learning. A very traditional learning method is discussed and some new methods with the integration of modern technology have been discussed. Although technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, ontology, fuzzy logic etc. have been used in learning systems they are still less automated, not personalized and do not pose the capability to self-learn. A method is proposed to increase the automation and self-learning in the e-learning management systems. Further, the personalization of learning for the user so that every type of learner can learn from the type and level of the content the learner seems fit is the main aim. The proposed system is feasible, economical and scalable which makes it suitable for every level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose an extension of the Open API specification (OAS) for the semantic description of RESTful services. We suggest that API descriptions (eg. on Clouds) be semantically annotated by associating OAS entities to entities in an ontology. The new approach, referred to Semantic OAS (SOAS) eliminates ambiguities and produces descriptions of RESTful services that are understandable by both, humans and machines. Moreover, SOAS descriptions are equivalent (i.e. can be translated) to an ontology. Therefore, SOAS services can be easily discovered (i.e. by other services), queried by Semantic Web query languages (e.g. SPARQL), checked by reasoners (e.g. Pellet) for consistency or inferring new (hidden) relationships and, finally, be used by service orchestration mechanisms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Companies adhere to federate environments in order to add value to their businesses by aggregating third parties services. Cloud computing comes in hand in this process speeding up the development and deployment of new service providers (SPs) and identity providers (IdPs) to be used into a federated environment. However, IdPs and SPs of OpenID Connect federations have a strong dependency on each other, they have to use the very same attribute names in order to exchange data. Our proposal lowers the dependency between IdPs and SPs using web semantics; instead of an agreement at a lower level such as attributes names, we propose that IdPs and SPs establish an agreement on the ontology to be used. Therefore, the name of attributes would not matter, but the semantic concept that attributes are associated with. Further, our proposal was added and tested into the OpenId Connect Implementation called MITREid Connect. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this research we develop a knowledge engine to give robots better understanding of human commands. The architecture uses ontology to determine how to hold an object in which orientation and makes robot understand the natural language command with spatial intelligence. In our approach, at first, the input command given in natural language is parsed using IBM Natural Language Understanding service, which identifies the action, subject and object. Then the system matches action and pattern with the list of skills available for the robot. The robot has a model database and a list of objects remaining in front from its sensors. From that list it will able to find the subject and object positions. From the model database it can find the object type and from the ontology the robot can check whether the subject can be put on top of the object. If it is not valid then robot will inform the user that the command cannot be performed. If it is valid then, the robot will perform the put operation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Risk management is an important part of software development. Risk identification is the first major step in the risk management process that determines possible risks in a software project and dictates how effective the risk management process will be. However, there are several approaches used to identify risk. The approaches depend on subjective decisions of risk or domain experts which increase cost and workload. Therefore, to make the risk identification more effective, a systematic and automated approach is necessary. In this paper, we propose an alternative risk identification scheme using knowledgeable ontology representing risk taxonomy and CMMI project planning guideline. The ontology provides the relations among risk factors and software project risks according to the structure of risk taxonomy and the relevant process areas in CMMI. In this paper, we focus and demonstrate the CMMI project planning process area as an initiative to construct our ontology. The resulting ontology is supportive as expected and scalable to handle more on the other process areas of CMMI and the addition of the software project risks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is increasingly used so that the number of providers offering services is rapidly increasing. Thus, a need to organize these services and to express relations between them arises. To answer this need, ontologies are used. To query these services, the authors use query languages, such as SPARQL, that return two types of results: either a list of required services, or an empty list. However, the second result is not desired. In fact, if the required service is not available, users want to be offered by a list of similar ones instead of the empty list. It is in this sense that the similarity, which provides more results ranked according to their utilities, is used. This paper first presents the Cloud ontology on which the authors’ work is based. It then defines and compares between two Cloud service discovery methods which are: the discovery based on query languages and the discovery based on similarity. To show the efficiency of the search based on similarity, the authors propose a search engine that allows the users to query services using a simple to use interface. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Security challenges are the most important obstacles for the advancement of IT-based on-demand services and cloud computing as an emerging technology. Lack of coincidence in identity management models based on defined policies and various security levels in different cloud servers is one of the most challenging issues in clouds. In this paper, a policy-based user authentication model has been presented to provide a reliable and scalable identity management and to map cloud users' access requests with defined polices of cloud servers. In the proposed schema several components are provided to define access policies by cloud servers, to apply policies based on a structural and reliable ontology, to manage user identities and to semantically map access requests by cloud users with defined polices. Finally, the reliability and efficiency of this policy-based authentication schema have been evaluated by scientific performance, security and competitive analysis. Overall, the results show that this model has met defined demands of the research to enhance the reliability and efficiency of identity management in cloud computing environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It is the cloud computing era. Substantial number of Cloud Services (CS) have emerged. The automation of the cloud services life cycle can be enhanced using domain ontologies in the cloud environment. Ontologies allow more efficient CS publication, discovery, selection, composition and recommendations. However, no broad cloud ontology for this purpose has dominated yet. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of existing cloud taxonomies and service ontologies. We present a comparison of the cloud service ontologies implementation features. Moreover, a semiotic metrics suite of ontology quality is used for the assessment process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing revolutionized the way resources (i.e. services and data) are accessed and used. Among the many changes in data processing and service provision paradigms, Software as a Service (SaaS) and collaborative editing are two of the most significant. This paper presents an approach based on semantic publish/subscribe paradigm to the development of collaborative editing applications. The main aim of this research work consists in exploiting emerging technologies (i.e. semantic web data representation formalisms, publish-subscribe platforms) in order to (1) overcome limitations coming from the traditional paradigm of single-author workflows, (2) enhance the editing capabilities of the users, (3) ease the development and maintainment of applications and (4) provide a shared high- level abstraction of the documents that fosters information-level interoperability and reusability. The proposed approach is then validated through an ad-hoc vector graphics application, SCEd (Semantic Collaborative Editor) built upon a SPARQL Event Processing Architecture derived from the Smart-M3 semantic publish-subscribe platform. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Among the various applications of high performance computing, security of cloud computing is very essential and greater awareness in India. Security issues in cloud are very challenging, as the data are roaming without any control. The need to keep the security as well as privacy of the information in the cloud becomes a critical issue. On the basis of cloud architectures we can specify the security rules for the web application attacks. In this paper we go through study, design and purpose of ontology containing encryption algorithms. Here ontology describes the security rule specification. Encryption algorithm describes comparision of performance among different algorithms. The main focus of this kind of work is to present a study of cloud security policy using some encryption algorithm based on ontology. This study will follow the ontology framework build for security policy rules. This paper also discusses cloud based web services attacks, design of semantic rules, and detection of malicious traffic over internet as well as tools for handling ontology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud software deployment, resource provisioning, monitoring and full cycle maintenance has proven to be time-consuming and complicated. While one cloud provider is good at one or a few services, other providers might be good at other services. Cloud users eventually want to consume most advantageous resources across multiple providers with the best price while avoiding vendor lock-in. Cloud users also need to safeguard their most valuable digital asset, their data, against cloud outage, which can happen to any vendor. This could mean using the same type of resources across multiple cloud providers. Moreover, cloud providers are continuously changing and evolving their services. Cloud users can only take advantage of these changes if they are able to relocate and real-locate resources using an autonomous and vendor independent tool. We propose a vendor-independent cloud provisioning tool that utilizes an ontology-based semantic reasoning to acquire the best feasible cloud resources for cloud users. In this paper, we outline an ontology subset for purchasing cloud resources or services based on price, user transaction volume, preference, quality of service and Service Layer Agreements (SLA). The proposed ontology is outlined in a case scenario followed by an applied algorithm for negotiating resource purchase between cloud consumer client and cloud vendor provisioning services. Such ontology can be used in inter-cloud federation API for monitoring and acquiring and maintaining the most advantageous cloud resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - the advent of online social networks has been one of the most exciting events in this decade. Many popular online social networks such as Twitter, Wechat, Weibo, LinkedIn, and Facebook have become increasingly popular. The consequences of the poor quality of data in a social network are often experienced in everyday life. This paper gives a domain ontology model, SNSQ Ontology, for data quality in the area of social networks. It could be a knowledge base for the quality assessment of the rich and linkage data in the social network. High-quality data would be relevant in the data searching, analyzing and mining. Based on the SNSQ Ontology the strategy for data quality assessment and repair is given. And the co-influence among the four quality dimensions, completeness, consistency, currency, and accuracy, are discussed to guarantee an effective assessment process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent growth of popularity of cloud computing services delivers various benefits in multiple fields of activity, including reduced resource costs due to optimized hardware setup, as well as improving mobility. However, cloud computing has some issues that need to be clarified, one of which is the security of cloud computing. The dispersion of cloud service vendors means that most security issues are still addressed often as unique to the particular vendor or cloud computing system, lacking standardization of the procedures and protocols that users and vendors follow when implementing a cloud computing system and running it. This paper deals with cloud computing security management. It offers an ontology, designed by the authors of the paper, specifically built to deal with cloud security controls covering the most important documents of the domain of cloud security management and the implementation of the proposed ontology to an enterprise architecture modeling language. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

In this demonstration we describe a novel log event analysis framework called Solution Recommender which provides a ranked list of solutions to overcome such system errors. The solution recommender gathers log events via a publisher/subscriber mechanism and indexes them inside the WSO2 Data Analytics Server (DAS). Collected information is analyzed using a knowledge graph which conducts log event pattern matching to identify solutions for system failures. We have implemented the proposed approach on WSO2 Log Analyzer for WSO2 API Manager and tested its frmctionality. In this paper we describe our experience of implementing the log event recommender interlace, the first such recommender developed in a log event analyzer system. The insights presented here will assist practitioners with implementing such Log Event analysis solutions for real world scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The consumption of Linked Data has dramatically increased with the increasing momentum towards semantic web. Linked data is essentially a very simplistic format for representation of knowledge in that all the knowledge is represented as triples which can be linked using one or more components from the triple. To date, most of the efforts has been towards either creating linked data by mining the web or making it available for users as a source of knowledgebase for knowledge engineering applications. In recent times there has been a growing need for these applications to interact with users in a natural language which required the transformation of the linked data knowledge into a natural language. The aim of the RealText project described in this paper, is to build a scalable framework to transform Linked Data into natural language by generating lexicalization patterns for triples. A lexicalization pattern is a syntactical pattern that will transform a given triple into a syntactically correct natural language sentence. Using DBpedia as the Linked Data resource, we have generated 283 accurate lexicalization patterns for a sample set of 25 ontology classes. We performed human evaluation on a test sub-sample with an inter-rater agreement of 0.86 and 0.80 for readability and accuracy respectively. This results showed that the lexicalization patterns generated language that are accurate, readable and emanates qualities of a human produced language. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Geologic survey procedures accumulate large volumes of structured and unstructured data. Fully exploiting the knowledge and information that are included in geological big data and improving the accessibility of large volumes of data are important endeavors. In this paper, which is based on the architecture of the geological survey information cloud-computing platform (GSICCP) and big-data-related technologies, we split geologic unstructured data into fragments and extract multi-dimensional features via geological domain ontology. These fragments are reorganized into a NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database, and then associations between the fragments are added. A specific class of geological questions was analyzed and transformed into workflow tasks according to the predefined rules and associations between fragments to identify spatial information and unstructured content.We establish a knowledge-driven geologic survey information smart-service platform (GSISSP) based on previous work, and we detail a study case for our research. The study case shows that all the content that has known relationships or semantic associations can be mined with the assistance of multiple ontologies, thereby improving the accuracy and comprehensiveness of geological information discovery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Although pockets of bioinformatics excellence have developed in Africa, generally, large-scale genomic data analysis has been limited by the availability of expertise and infrastructure. H3ABioNet, a pan-African bioinformatics network, was established to build capacity specifically to enable H3Africa (Human Heredity and Health in Africa) researchers to analyze their data in Africa. Since the inception of the H3Africa initiative, H3ABioNet's role has evolved in response to changing needs from the consortium and the African bioinformatics community. Objectives H3ABioNet set out to develop core bioinformatics infrastructure and capacity for genomics research in various aspects of data collection, transfer, storage, and analysis. Methods and Results Various resources have been developed to address genomic data management and analysis needs of H3Africa researchers and other scientific communities on the continent. NetMap was developed and used to build an accurate picture of network performance within Africa and between Africa and the rest of the world, and Globus Online has been rolled out to facilitate data transfer. A participant recruitment database was developed to monitor participant enrollment, and data is being harmonized through the use of ontologies and controlled vocabularies. The standardized metadata will be integrated to provide a search facility for H3Africa data and biospecimens. Because H3Africa projects are generating large-scale genomic data, facilities for analysis and interpretation are critical. H3ABioNet is implementing several data analysis platforms that provide a large range of bioinformatics tools or workflows, such as Galaxy, the Job Management System, and eBiokits. A set of reproducible, portable, and cloud-scalable pipelines to support the multiple H3Africa data types are also being developed and dockerized to enable execution on multiple computing infrastructures. In addition, new tools have been developed for analysis of the uniquely divergent African data and for downstream interpretation of prioritized variants. To provide support for these and other bioinformatics queries, an online bioinformatics helpdesk backed by broad consortium expertise has been established. Further support is provided by means of various modes of bioinformatics training. Conclusions For the past 4 years, the development of infrastructure support and human capacity through H3ABioNet, have significantly contributed to the establishment of African scientific networks, data analysis facilities, and training programs. Here, we describe the infrastructure and how it has affected genomics and bioinformatics research in Africa. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As scientific research evolves, data continue to grow at an exponential rate. This growth calls for a need for more data repositories to store the data, and the creation of additional centralized repositories to provide standards for researchers. Common data repositories allow for collaboration and easier sharing of data, critical for further advancement of scientific understanding of a variety of topics. LungMAP (the Molecular Atlas of Lung Development) is an open-access reference resource that provides a comprehensive molecular atlas of the normal developing lung in humans and mice and provides data and reagents to the research community. The database utilizes RDF, SPARQL, and OWL. LungMAP exemplifies the use of semantic web technologies to provide a collaborative and open access data application for the scientific research community. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Security vulnerabilities are a main cause of network security. Vulnerability severity assessment gives us the constructive suggestions on the priority of bug fixes, which help reduce the occurrence of the security incidents. To obtain the good assessment results, a method of evaluating vulnerability severity based on cloud model and analytic hierarchy process (CMAHP) was proposed. First, we utilize AHP to establish vulnerability severity multi-level index system. Then, the cloud theory is used to set up the remark set cloud, the scale set cloud and the membership function cloud to respectively confirm the quantification cloud graph of remark set, factor weights and membership fuzzy matrix. Combining with vulnerability ontology value and vulnerability correlation value, we can achieve the evaluation of vulnerability severity. Experiment shows that the method has a better assessment on vulnerability severity results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, several enterprises worldwide have started to evolve their production processes with new automation and data exchange policies by means of the adoption of emergent technologies, i.e. knowledge graphs, sensor networks, big data, and cloud computing. While several domains have been already involved in this revolution, other parties, such as the fast-fashion industries, have started to move the first steps in that direction since few months. In this article we describe the first outcomes of a project, i.e. Refactoring Imperial Selling Data (RISED), which aims at using Semantic Web technologies so as to simplify the management and the enrichment of a huge set of data that are continuously collected by Imperial Fashion, one of the most important fast-fashion companies in Italy. In particular, we introduce the process adopted for the development of a unifying model (i.e. an OWL 2 DL ontology) for the description of all the Imperial Fashion data and we propose some mechanisms for converting the original data stored in existing databases according to the new ontology. Finally, we introduce some prototypical visual tools that use the converted data for addressing some of the questions that have been raised by Imperial Fashion employees during several informal meetings we had about the project RISED. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Cloud services are becoming an essential part of many organizations. Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mishmash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to its computing power and storage capacity, the Cloud has been integrated with Cyber-physical systems, thus creating complex and powerful Cyber-physical Cloud platforms. It is important that these systems have proper security and clear specifications in order to be trustworthy and reliable. To address these requirements and issues we propose a semantic, ontology-based architecture for Cyber-physical Cloud systems. It is based on Semantic Sensor Network Ontology and STAC (Security Toolbox: Attacks & Countermeasures) Ontology, aggregating domains and clusters of sensing nodes with a central backbone which processes data and stores it in the Cloud, taking into account also the security properties of such a complex system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Formal verification plays a crucial role when dealing with correctness of systems. In a previous work, the authors proposed a class of models, the Unary Resource Description Framework Petri Nets (U-RDF-PN), which integrated Petri nets and (RDF-based) semantic information. The work also proposed a model checking approach for the analysis of system behavioural properties that made use of the net reachability graph. Computing such a graph, specially when dealing with high-level structures as RDF graphs, is a very expensive task that must be considered. This paper describes the development of a parallel solution for the computation of the reachability graph of U-RDF-PN models. Besides that, the paper presents some experimental results when the tool was deployed in cluster and cloud frameworks. The results not only show the improvement in the total time required for computing the graph, but also the high scalability of the solution, which make it very useful thanks to the current (and future) availability of cloud infrastructures.

AB  - Software Architecture (SA) plays a critical role in designing, developing and evolving cloud-based platforms that can be used to provision different types of services for consumers on demand. In this paper, we present a Reference Architecture (RA) for designing cloud-based Tools as a service SPACE (TSPACE), which can provision a bundled suite of tools following the Software as a Service (SaaS) model. The reference architecture has been designed by leveraging information structuring approaches and by using well-known architecture design principles and patterns. The RA has been documented using view-based approach and has been presented in terms of its context, goals, the RA meta-model, information structuring and relationship models using ontologies and components of the RA. We have demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the RA with the help of a prototype and have used the prototype to provision software architecting tools. We have also evaluated the RA in terms of effectiveness of the design decisions and the RA's completeness and feasibility using scenario-based architecture evaluation method. The proposed TSPACE RA can provide valuable insights to information structure approaches and guidelines for designing and implementing TSPACE for various domains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes a methodology for energy aware management of virtualized data centers (DC) based on dynamically adapting and scaling the computing capacity to the characteristics of the workload. To assess the energy efficiency of DC operation, we have defined a novel ontological model for representing its energy and performance characteristics and a new metric for aggregating Green and Key Performance Indicators and calculating at run-time the DC Greenness Level. Workload balancing and consolidation is achieved by means of an automated reinforcement learning-based decision process targeting to increase the workload density and to scale down the unused computing resources. Evaluation results show that up to 15.6 % energy savings are obtained on our test bed DC. Tests conducted in a simulated environment show that the time and space overhead of our methodology are within reasonable limits and that by organizing the servers in hierarchical clusters, the methodology can manage highly dynamic workload in large DCs with thousands of servers. The methodology is already implemented in the Green Cloud Scheduler, an official component of the OpenNebula Middleware which is available in the OpenNebula Ecosystem web site to be downloaded and used. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we present a hybrid modeling approach which supports the continuous alignment of business and IT in the cloud. Business Process as a Service provides the end-to-end cloud support for business processes instead of single applications. A graphical modelling environment allows non-technical modelers to design business processes and to specify requirements in human-interpretable way. Via semantic lifting, the graphical models can be annotated with classes and values from an enterprise ontology. The BPaaS Ontology contains the relevant classes for the smart Business and IT-Cloud alignment. It supports the modeler in using a standard terminology and thus ensures consistent modeling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - System of systems engineering (SoSE) involves the complex procedure of translating capability needs into the high-level requirements for system of systems (SoS) and evaluating how the SoS quality requirements meet their capability needs. One of the key issues is to model the SoS requirements and automate the verification procedure. To solve the problem of modeling and verification, meta-models are proposed to refine both functional and non-functional characteristics of the SoS requirements. A domain-specific modeling language is defined by extending Unified Modeling Language (UML) class and association with fuzzy constructs to model the vague and uncertain concepts of the SoS quality requirements. The efficiency evaluation function of the cloud model is introduced to evaluate the efficiency of the SoS quality requirements. Then a concise algorithm transforms the fuzzy UML models into the description logic (DL) ontology so that the verification can be automated with a DL reasoner. This method implements modeling and verification of high-level SoS quality requirements. A crisp case is used to facilitate and demonstrate the correctness and feasibility of this method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has achieved great development both in academic and industry communities due to the fact that it relieves the burden of data storage and data management. However, data stored in the cloud may suffer from malicious use by cloud service providers. Therefore, exploring an efficient search technique for encrypted data is extremely urgent. This paper focuses on semantic search and preferred search schemes in cloud. We survey the existed schemes' advantage or disadvantage. At last, we give some open issues and research challenges in the future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The move of computational genomics workflows to Cloud Computing platforms is associated with a new level of integration and interoperability that challenges existing data representation formats. The Variant Calling Format (VCF) is in a particularly sensitive position in that regard, with both clinical and consumer-facing analysis tools relying on this self-contained description of genomic variation in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) results. In this report we identify an isomorphic map between VCF and the reference Resource Description Framework. RDF is advanced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to enable representations of linked data that are both distributed and discoverable. The resulting ability to decompose VCF reports of genomic variation without loss of context addresses the need to modularize and govern NGS pipelines for Precision Medicine. Specifically, it provides the flexibility (i.e. The indexing) needed to support the wide variety of clinical scenarios and patient-facing governance where only part of the VCF data is fitting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A secured 'co-operative cloud computing utility', is a shared set of unique and virtually interconnected system assets. These, computing services, are accessed globally using thin clients and handheld devices through standard collective GUI, anytime, at any location upon payment of specified usage charges. This multi-ally computing utility perks up the advanced facilities to the existing assets. The security and privacy controlling of this utility (data centers, and data storage) is uniformly, vested with service patrons and suppliers, both stakeholders with shared responsibility of security implementation using multilateral relationship among them. In this paper, we propose the ontology of this vicinity, which demonstrates an interrelated layered architecture for a secured co-operative galactic computing utility. This computing architecture is proposed empirically based on our understanding and survey with various industry/academic professionals. We tried to understand the challenges they faced while using the cloud system. So, we conceptually propose this ally architecture which consists of multi-layer with multi-lateral co-operative multi-factor balanced security framework with common business interests along with shared responsibility among the stakeholders. Also we try to prove empirically multilateral balanced security which in-turn increases the strong defense measures among the multi-laterally allied bunch of users. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper focuses on detecting and analyzing cyber-attacks in cloud environment, it represents a novel approach of detecting cyber-attacks by analyzing attacks pattern using risk assessment methodologies. The aims of our solution is to combine evidences obtained from Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) deployed in cloud services with data of risk assessment related to each attack pattern. Our approach presents a new qualitative solution for analyzing each symptom, indicator and vulnerability to detect the impact and likelihood of distributed and multi-steps attacks directed to cloud environments. The implementation of this approach will minimize the false positive alerts and will improve the performance of the IDS. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing enables enterprises to realise significant cost savings whilst accelerating the development of new innovative applications. Nevertheless, due to security concerns, enterprises are reluctant to migrate their operations to the cloud. In addition, the proliferation of cloud services transforms the enterprise IT environment into a complex ecosystem of collaborating services. One way to tame this complexity and alleviate the security concerns is to rely on policies that regulate the deployment, delivery and governance of cloud services. However, the heterogeneity inherent in such services, coupled with the dynamic nature of cloud environments, hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable policies. This paper proposes a generic framework for the definition and representation of policies that are enforceable across diverse administrative domains and are amenable to automated correctness checks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fog computing is a promising paradigm in terms of extending cloud computing to an edge network. In a broad sense, fog computing in Internet-of-Vehicles(IoV) provides low-latency services since fog nodes are closely located with moving cars and are locally distributed. In this paper, we propose a fog computing architecture based on a publish/subscribe model. After that, we describe a traffic congestion control scenario using a smart traffic light system which operates on top of the proposed architecture. Furthermore, we propose an upper-level domain ontology in order to enhance the expressivity of knowledge and describe a variety of semantic properties which interlink spatial information in IoV. Finally, we present an active rule where supports the exchange of event-driven messages between publishing and subscribing fog nodes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data integration continues to baffle researchers even though substantial progress has been made. Although the emergence of technologies such as XML, web services, semantic web and cloud computing have helped, a system in which biologists are comfortable articulating new applications and developing them without technical assistance from a computing expert is yet to be realized. The distance between a friendly graphical interface that does little, and a 'traditional' system though clunky yet powerful, is deemed too great more often than not. The question that remains unanswered is, if a user can state her query involving a set of complex, heterogeneous and distributed life sciences resources in an easy to use language and execute it without further help from a computer savvy programmer. In this paper, we present a declarative meta-language, called VisFlow, for requirement specification, and a translator for mapping requirements into executable queries in a variant of SQL augmented with integration artifacts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Compared to traditional medical services provided within hospitals, m-Health monitoring systems (MHMSs) face more challenges in personalised health data processing. To achieve personalised and high-quality health monitoring by means of new technologies, such as mobile network and cloud computing, in this paper, a framework of an m-Health monitoring system based on a cloud computing platform (Cloud-MHMS) is designed to implement pervasive health monitoring. Furthermore, the modules of the framework, which are Cloud Storage and Multiple Tenants Access Control Layer, Healthcare Data Annotation Layer, and Healthcare Data Analysis Layer, are discussed. In the data storage layer, a multiple tenant access method is designed to protect patient privacy. In the data annotation layer, linked open data are adopted to augment health data interoperability semantically. In the data analysis layer, the process mining algorithm and similarity calculating method are implemented to support personalised treatment plan selection. These three modules cooperate to implement the core functions in the process of health monitoring, which are data storage, data processing, and data analysis. Finally, we study the application of our architecture in the monitoring of antimicrobial drug usage to demonstrate the usability of our method in personal healthcare analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The lack of standardized descriptions of cloud services hinders their discovery. In an effort to standardize cloud service descriptions, several works propose to use ontologies. Nevertheless, the adoption of any of the proposed ontologies calls for an evaluation to show its efficiency in cloud service discovery. Indeed, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services by proposing ontologies. Since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology (CSO), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. To this end, this paper has a three-fold contribution. First, we specify a set of patterns and anti-patterns in order to evaluate our CSO. Second, we define an anti-pattern detection algorithm based on SPARQL queries which provides a set of correction recommendations to help ontologists revise their ontology. Finally, tests were conducted in relation to: (i) the algorithm efficiency and (ii) anti-pattern detection of design anomalies as well as taxonomic and domain errors within CSO. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions (ADR) result in significant morbidity and mortality in patients, and a substantial proportion of these ADRs are caused by drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Pharmacovigilance methods are used to detect unanticipated DDIs and ADRs by mining Spontaneous Reporting Systems, such as the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). However, these methods do not provide mechanistic explanations for the discovered drug-ADR associations in a systematic manner. In this paper, we present a systems pharmacology-based approach to perform mechanism-based pharmacovigilance. We integrate data and knowledge from four different sources using Semantic Web Technologies and Linked Data principles to generate a systems network. We present a network-based Apriori algorithm for association mining in FAERS reports. We evaluate our method against existing pharmacovigilance methods for three different validation sets. Our method has AUROC statistics of 0.7-0.8, similar to current methods, and event-specific thresholds generate AUROC statistics greater than 0.75 for certain ADRs. Finally, we discuss the benefits of using Semantic Web technologies to attain the objectives for mechanism-based pharmacovigilance.

AB  - As a basis for the efficient data supply for web portals, web-based and mobile applications of several German environmental authorities, a microservice-based infrastructure is being used. It consists of a generic data model and a series of corresponding generic services, e.g. for the provision of master data, metrics, spatial data, digital assets, metadata, and links between them. The main objectives are the efficient provision of data as well as the use of the same data by a wide range of applications. In addition, the used technologies and services should enable data supplyasopen (government) data or as linked data in the sense of the Semantic Web. In a first version, these services are used exclusively for read access to the data. For this purpose, the data are usually extracted from their original systems, possibly processed and then stored redundantly in powerful backend systems (“Web Cache”). Generic microservices provide uniform REST interfaces to access the data. Each service can use different backend systems connected via adapters. In this way, consuming components such as frontend modules in a Web portal can transparently access various backend systems via stable interfaces, which can therefore be selected optimally for each application. A number of tools and workflows ensure the updating and consistency of the data in the Web Cache. Microservices and backend systems are operated on the basis of container virtualization using flexible cloud infrastructures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With rapid developments in cloud computing, the creation of a cloud based prefabricated component supply chain platform marks an important initiative signifying an industry breakthrough and innovation. The application of this cloud platform will effectively integrate the social resources of the prefabricated components supply chain and realize the reconfiguration of distributed resources. In order to facilitate this, much research is needed to develop a flexible prefabricated component data integration model using ontologies and semantics. Such a model can support adaptive heterogeneous system integration and interaction. In addition, this cloud platform can be used to support coordination within the supply chain using ontology rules. This can greatly enhance managerial decision support. This paper proposes a flexible distributed information integration mechanism and develops an ontology-based management support application, which will play an important role in resource integration and the optimal allocation of prefabricated components within the supply chain. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposes the concept of e-Learning cloud broker which is a framework of a learning management system on cloud, providing a common platform to all the e-Learning providers to share their data and increase their accessibility. After taking the stores of information from the registered providers, the orchestration layer of the system will semantically annotate the data and build a useful and manageable base of knowledge using defined global and local context ontologies. On the other side when a learner accesses the portal, depending upon his profile details, it gives him the precise and wide amount of data by semantically inferring his request. Learner will be also provided with a platform for blogging, recommending the content and sharing their ideas forming the foundation of collaborative learning. The framework will utilize the benefits of both ontology and cloud computing to provide the mechanism to connect man and machine. This way the information stored in any server of any part of the world can be organized into meaningful knowledge bases and hence can be accessed by those who can be benefited from them. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - By embracing cloud computing enterprises are able to boost their agility and productivity whilst realising significant cost savings. However, due to security and privacy concerns, many enterprises are reluctant to migrate their data and operations to the cloud. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise access control policies that infuse suitable security controls into cloud services. Nevertheless, the complexity inherent in such policies, stemming from the dynamic nature of cloud environments, calls for a framework that provides assurances with respect to the effectiveness of the policies. In this respect, this work proposes a class of constraints, the so-called well-formedness constraints, that provide such assurances by empowering stakeholders to harness the attributes of the policies. Both the policies and the constraints are expressed ontologically hence enabling automated reasoning about the abidance of the policies with the constraints. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The advances in Information Technology (IT) which allowed the transformation of products into cyber-physical systems (CPS), brought new challenges and opportunities for development in manufacturing. Connected product networks (CPN) which bare more advanced features opposing to regular products, require special resource management and more flexible processes during the whole lifecycle of a product, from conceptualization to development and use. Cloud computing and data analytics enhance the opportunities for reconfiguration and optimization of machines and products, leading to reduced costs for the factories. Situational awareness driven by ontologies, together with Big Data analytics exhibit significant potential for competitive manufacturing that is able to follow the fast-evolving market, nevertheless, with respect to the user and the environment. The current paper suggests an approach for the exploitation of manufacturing context, using sensors and data management techniques in industrial business cases, to achieve reuse of information, resulting to reduced manufacturing waste. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As a new software paradigm, cloud computing provides services dynamically according to user requirements. However, it tends to disclose personal information due to collaborative computing and transparent interactions among software as a service (SaaS) services. We propose a private data disclosure checking method that can be applied to the collaboration interaction process. First, we describe the privacy requirement with ontology and description logic. Second, with dynamic description logic, we validate whether SaaS services are authorized to obtain a user's privacy attributes, to prevent unauthorized services from obtaining their private data. Third, we monitor authorized SaaS services to guarantee privacy requirements. Therefore, we can prevent users' private data from being used and propagated illegally. Finally, we propose privacy disclosure checking algorithms, and demonstrate their correctness and feasibility by experiments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Enterprises are increasingly embracing cloud computing in order to reduce costs and increase agility in their everyday business operations. Nevertheless, due mainly to confidentiality, privacy and integrity concerns, many organisations are reluctant to migrate their sensitive data to the cloud. In order to alleviate these security concerns, this chapter proposes the PaaSword framework: a generic PaaS solution that provides capabilities for guiding developers through the process of defining appropriate policies for protecting their sensitive data. More specifically, this chapter outlines the construction of an extensible and declarative formalism for representing policy-related knowledge, one which disentangles the definition of a policy from the code employed for enforcing it. It also outlines the construction of a suitable Context-aware Security Model, a framework of concepts and properties in terms of which the policy-related knowledge is expressed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Several SLA languages have been proposed, some specifically for the cloud domain. However, after extensively analysing the domain's requirements considering the SLA lifecycle, we conclude that none of them covers the necessary aspects for application in diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose SSLAC, where we combine the capabilities of two prominent service specification and SLA languages: OWL-Q and SLAC. These languages have different scopes but complementary features. SLAC is domain specific with validation and verification capabilities. OWL-Q is a higher level language based on ontologies and well defined semantics. Their combination advances the state of the art in many perspectives. It enables the SLA's semantic verification and inference and, at the same time, its constraint-based modelling and enforcement. It also provides a complete formal approach for defining non-functional terms and an enforcement framework covering real-world scenarios. The advantages of SSLAC, in terms of expressiveness and features, are then shown in a use case modelled by it. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - By taking up the cloud computing paradigm enterprises are able to realise significant cost savings whilst increasing their agility and productivity. However, due to security concerns, many enterprises are reluctant to migrate their critical data and operations to the cloud. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise suitable policies that infuse adequate access controls into cloud services. However, the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, coupled with the heterogeneous nature of cloud services, hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable access control policies that are suitable for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work proposes an ontological template for the semantic representation of context expressions in access control policies. This template is underpinned by a suitable set of interrelated concepts that generically capture a wide range of contextual knowledge that must be considered during the evaluation of policies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The service discovery process involves many complex tasks such as service identification, composition, selection, and adaptation. Currently, there exist many discovery schemes that separately handle such discovery tasks. When a company needs to build a discovery service, it manually selects the suitable discovery schemes, encapsulates them as services, then invokes them as a composite web service. However, when different discovery tasks/schemes are needed, such composite discovery service needs to be manually reconfigured, and different versions of the discovery service are created and managed. To overcome such problems, we propose to build a dynamic self-configuring discovery service (i.e., DISCO), that takes the required discovery policy from users, then automatically finds the suitable discovery schemes in a context-sensitive manner, and finally arranges them as a collection of executable BPEL processes. This is done by adopting different types of knowledge regarding the services' aspects, discovery schemes, and the adopted software ontologies. Such different knowledge types are captured and managed by the previously proposed JAMEJAM framework. Experimental results show that DISCO successfully managed to reconfigure itself for different discovery policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Linked Data (LD) represent a great mechanism towards integrating information across disparate sources. The respective technology can also be exploited to perform inferencing for deriving added-value knowledge. As such, LD technology can really assist in performing various analysis tasks over information related to business process execution. In the context of Business Process as a Service (BPaaS), the first real challenge is to collect and link information originating from different systems by following a certain structure. As such, this paper proposes two main ontologies that serve this purpose: A KPI and a Dependency one. Based on these well-connected ontologies, an innovative Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis system is then built which exhibits two main analysis capabilities: KPI assessment and drill-down, where the second can be exploited to find root causes of KPI violations. Compared to other KPI analysis systems, LD usage enables the flexible construction and assessment of any KPI kind allowing experts to better explore the possible KPI space. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sky computing is a new computing paradigm leveraging resources of multiple Cloud providers to create a large-scale distributed infrastructure. N2Sky is a research initiative promising a framework for the utilization of Neural Networks as services across many Clouds integrating into a Sky. This involves a number of challenges ranging from the provision, discovery and utilization of N2Sky services to the management, monitoring, metering and accounting of the N2Sky infrastructure. This paper focuses on the semantic discovery of N2Sky services through a human-centered querying mechanism termed as N2Query. N2Query allows N2Sky users to specify their problem statement as natural language queries. In response to the natural language queries, it delivers a list of ranked neural network services to the user as a solution to their stated problem. The search algorithm of N2Query is based on the semantic mapping of ontologies referring to problem and solution domains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data integration continues to baffle researchers even though substantial progress has been made. Although the emergence of technologies such as XML, web services, semantic web and cloud computing have helped, a system in which biologists are comfortable articulating new applications and developing them without technical assistance from a computing expert is yet to be realised. The distance between a friendly graphical interface that does little, and a 'traditional' system though clunky yet powerful, is deemed too great more often than not. The question that remains unanswered is, if a user can state her query involving a set of complex, heterogeneous and distributed life sciences resources in an easy to use language and execute it without further help from a computer savvy programmer. In this paper, we present a declarative meta-language, called VisFlow, for requirement specification, and a translator for mapping requirements into executable queries in a variant of SQL augmented with integration artefacts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Storytelling has evolved over the years: its ability to enchant, transform and persuade makes it a formidable mean, malleable and customizable, but not easy to use. The use of new technologies allowing it to reach a far greater level of effectiveness: the audience can join in the storytelling process, thus impacting positively on engagement and facilitating the development of long lasting relationships. Our contribution is a revisited digital storytelling approach to discovery cultural heritage and tourism. Some of the benefits which digital storytelling brings to the tourism industry are that it enriches tourist destinations and attractions, it preserves and explores local culture and it shows the authentic experience of cultural tourism. Furthermore, digital storytelling develops cross-cultural understanding. In particular, we have chosen to employ an ontological model in order to realize a dynamic digital storytelling system, able to collect and elaborate social information and contents about the users giving them a personalized story based on the place they are visiting. The theoretical framework and experimental results are presented and described. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the emergence of the cloud computing paradigm, the personal data usage has raised several privacy concerns like the lack of user control, the non-compliance with the user’s preferences and/or regulations, the difficulty of the data flow tracking, etc. In particular, one unsolved problem is to ensure that customers data usage policies are enforced, regardless of who accesses the data, how they are processed, where are the data stored, transferred and duplicated. This issue calls for two requirements to be satisfied. First, data should be handled in accordance with both owners’ preferences and regulations policies whenever it exists in the cloud and throughout its lifetime. Second, a consistent data flow tracking should be maintained to follow up the data derivation. Toward addressing these issues, we propose in this paper a hybrid approach to protect private data in the cloud. We propose the PriArmor data content for self-defending data when stored or transferred in the cloud and the PriArmor agent that acts as an armor for its privacy protection when processed by the cloud-based services. To facilitate the policy specification, we propose a novel privacy ontology model that drives the data owner to express his privacy requirements and to consider the regulations policies. Finally, we present the implementation details as well as a demonstration that shows flexibility and efficiency of our approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Graphs play an important role in modern world, due to their widespread use for modeling, representing and organizing linked data. Taking into consideration that most of the “killer” applications require a graph-based representation (e.g., the Web, social network management, protein-protein interaction networks), efficient query processing and analysis techniques are required, not only because these graphs are massive but also because the operations that must be supported are complex, requiring significant computational resources. In many cases, each graph edge e is annotated by a probability value p(e), expressing its existential uncertainty. This means that with probability p(e) the edge will be present in the graph and with probability 1 − p(e) the edge will be absent. This gives rise to the concept of probabilistic graphs (also known as uncertain graphs). Formally, a probabilistic graph G is a triplet (V, E, p) where V is the set of nodes, E is the set of edges and p: E → (0, 1]. The main challenge posed by this formulation is that problems that are relatively easy to solve in exact graphs become very difficult (or even intractable) in probabilistic graphs. In this paper, we perform an overview of the algorithmic techniques proposed in the literature for uncertain graph analysis. In particular, we center our focus on the following graph mining tasks: clustering, maximal cliques, k-nearest neighbors and core decomposition. We conclude the paper with a short discussion related to distributed mining of uncertain graphs which is expected to achieve significant performance improvements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to arm yourself and assess risk correctly in the cloud, carrying out investigations are necessary. Though Cloud Computing is the buzzing technology now a days, with the advent with which cloud computing is developing and providing solutions to the upcoming technologies where on the other side of it there also lies a down fall with respect to theft of data in the cloud, loss of data in the cloud which are related to forensic, these things create an distrustful relation between cloud user and cloud providers, during the past half decade cloud forensic has emerged as a challenging point that has to be solved in cloud computing, the prevailing existing solutions which were suggested at the initial stage of Cloud Forensics were satisfied at that time but those solutions cannot rule now also, due to which they are not up to the mark to give much satisfaction which there by strengthen the faith of users in cloud, and makes Cloud Service Providers to provide the services and make a path to be laid for the coming technologies to utilize the flavors of cloud computing. This paper inculcates the contents related to cloud forensic which are traced out which are being known, to be known. In this paper we have traced out the major causes of Cloud Forensics, and thrown a light on the causes and origins which are helpful for laying a success ladder for Cloud Forensic concepts, and provided relevant content which would be helpful to trace out the solutions which are causing obstacles in the field of Cloud Forensics, utilizing which one can get an overview of the challenges and if considered can definitely lead to a good solution methods which if implemented in a proper way can lead to recovery of lost data as well as to know the real cause of the effect and also in order to reduce their effect. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Annotation of human genetic variants enables genotype-phenotype association studies at the gene, pathway, and tissue level. Annotation results are difficult to reproduce across study sites due to shifting software versions and a lack of a unified hardware interface between study sites. Cloud computing offers a promising solution by integrating hardware and software into reproducible virtual appliances which may be utilized on-demand and shared across institutions. We developed ENSEMBL VEP on EC2 (EVE), a cloud-based virtual appliance for annotation of human genetic variants built around the ENSEMBL Variant Effect Predictor. We integrated virtual hardware infrastructure, opensource software, and publicly available genomic datasets to provide annotation capability for genetic variants in the context of genes/transcripts, Gene Ontology pathways, tissue-specific expression from the Gene Expression Atlas, miRNA annotations, minor allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Exome Aggregation Consortium, and deleteriousness scores from Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion. We demonstrate the utility of EVE by annotating the genetic variants in a case-control study of glaucoma. Cloud computing can reduce the difficulty of replicating complex software pipelines such as annotation pipelines across study sites. We provide a publicly available CloudFormation template of the EVE virtual appliance which can automatically provision and deploy a parameterized, preconfigured hardware/software stack ready for annotation of human genetic variants (github.com/epistasislab/EVE). This approach offers increased reproducibility in human genetic studies by providing a unified appliance to researchers across the world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Semantic web is an extension of the web which focuses on the meaning of data content rather than the structure of the data content. It promotes many standards by the world wide web consortium (W3C). RDF is a data interchange standard widely used by semantic web community. Cloud computing is a computing paradigm which involves outsourcing of computing resources with the capabilities of resource scalability, on demand provisioning with little or no up-front IT infrastructure investment costs. Resource Description framework is a semantic data model for cloud computing. This paper analyze RDF in terms of its present status, comparison between RDF and traditional data models, its usage in semantic web data management, overview of semantic web rule languages and finally its limitations in representing concepts are examined. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A new ontology is required to complement the change in business model due to a disruptive technology called cloud computing. The cloud computing technology has the potential to integrate a supply chain and create a better value network. The existing models from previous research are unable to map the benefits of cloud computing from the perspectives of multiple actors and highlight where exactly the benefits occur along the supply chain. The network business model is proposed to facilitate the adoption of the cloud computing technology that maps four key components namely value, activity, actor, and benefit. A case study involving a logistics company and a cloud solution provider was conducted to observe the adaptability and the rigidity of the model. Rather than going head-to-head with the license-based model such as ERP, cloud-based solutions integrate such systems and create an end-to-end visibility across the supply chain, which includes procurement, distribution, and inventory visibilities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Service Level Agreements (SLA) represents the principal means to control the Quality of Service (QoS). In cloud computing, various advanced SLA strategies are used; some techniques among others try to avoid the SLA violations. Taking into account the cloud consumer contextual parameters is a promising way to predict and avoid costly SLA violations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a context-aware system for the SLA in order to guarantee the QoS. We create a contextual ontology to introduce the semantic meaning of the cloud consumer contextual parameters. In addition, using reasoning techniques, we (1) predict SLA violations and we (2) choose and apply the corrective actions in autonomous manner. This allows getting a proactive adjustment of the cloud service execution and respecting the SLA parameters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, service trading over the Web is gaining momentum. In this highly dynamic scenario, both providers and consumers need to formalize their contractual and legal relationship, creating service level agreements. Although there exist some proposals that provide models to describe that relationship, they usually only cover technical aspects, not providing explicit semantics to the agreement terms. Furthermore, these models cannot be effectively shared on the Web, since they do not actually follow Web principles. These drawbacks hamper take-up and automatic analysis. In this article, we introduce Linked USDL Agreement, a semantic model to specify, manage and share service level agreement descriptions on the Web. This model is part of the Linked USDL family of ontologies that can describe not only technical but also business related aspects of services, incorporating Web principles. We validate our proposal by describing agreements in computational and non-computational scenarios, namely cloud computing and business process outsourcing services. Moreover, we evaluate the actual coverage and expressiveness of Linked USDL Agreement comparing it with existing models. In order to foster its adoption and effectively manage the service level agreement lifecycle, we present an implemented tool that supports creation, automatic analysis, and publication on the Web of agreement descriptions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, railway infrastructure designers rely heavily on computer simulators and expert systems to model, analyze and evaluate potential deployments prior to their installation. This paper presents the railway power consumption simulator model (RPCS), a cloud-based model for the design, simulation and evaluation of railway electric infrastructures. This model integrates the parameters of an infrastructure within a search engine that generates and evaluates a set of simulations to achieve optimal designs, according to a given set of objectives and restrictions. The knowledge of the domain is represented as an ontology that translates the elements in the infrastructure into an electric circuit, which is simulated to obtain a wide range of electric metrics. In order to support the execution of thousands of scenarios in a scalable, efficient and fault-tolerant manner, this paper introduces an architecture to deploy the model in a cloud environment, and a dimensioning model to find the types and number of instances that maximize performance while minimizing the externalization costs. The resulting model is applied to a particular case study, allowing the execution of over one thousand concurrent experiments in a virtual cluster on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Names in programming are vital for understanding the meaning of code and big data. We define code2brain (C2B) interfaces as maps in compilers and brains between meaning and naming syntax, which help to understand executable code. While working toward an Evolvix syntax for general-purpose programming that makes accurate modeling easy for biologists, we observed how names affect C2B quality. To protect learning and coding investments, C2B interfaces require long-term backward compatibility and semantic reproducibility (accurate reproduction of computational meaning from coder-brains to reader-brains by code alone). Semantic reproducibility is often assumed until confusing synonyms degrade modeling in biology to deciphering exercises. We highlight empirical naming priorities from diverse individuals and roles of names in different modes of computing to show how naming easily becomes impossibly difficult. We present the Evolvix BEST (Brief, Explicit, Summarizing, Technical) Names concept for reducing naming priority conflicts, test it on a real challenge by naming subfolders for the Project Organization Stabilizing Tool system, and provide naming questionnaires designed to facilitate C2B debugging by improving names used as keywords in a stabilizing programming language. Our experiences inspired us to develop Evolvix using a flipped programming language design approach with some unexpected features and BEST Names at its core. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Workflow for remote sensing quantitative retrieval is the “bridge” between Grid services and Grid-enabled application of remote sensing quantitative retrieval. Workflow averts low-level implementation details of the Grid and hence enables users to focus on higher levels of application. The workflow for remote sensing quantitative retrieval plays an important role in remote sensing Grid and Cloud computing services, which can support the modelling, construction and implementation of large-scale complicated applications of remote sensing science. The validation of workflow is important in order to support the large-scale sophisticated scientific computation processes with enhanced performance and to minimize potential waste of time and resources. To research the semantic correctness of user-defined workflows, in this paper, we propose a workflow validation method based on tacit knowledge research in the remote sensing domain. We first discuss the remote sensing model and metadata. Through detailed analysis, we then discuss the method of extracting the domain tacit knowledge and expressing the knowledge with ontology. Additionally, we construct the domain ontology with Protégé. Through our experimental study, we verify the validity of this method in two ways, namely data source consistency error validation and parameters matching error validation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Platform as a service (PaaS) is one of the Cloud computing services that provide a computing platform in the Cloud, allowing customers to develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. The primary disadvantage for an SME to enter the emerging PaaS market is the possibility of being locked into a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants. The PaaSport project focuses on facilitating SMEs to deploy business applications on the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering and to seamlessly migrate these applications on demand, via a thin, non-intrusive Cloud-broker, in the form of a Cloud PaaS Marketplace. PaaSport enables PaaS provider SMEs to roll out semantically interoperable PaaS offerings, by annotating them using a unified PaaS semantic model that has been defined as an OWL ontology. In this paper we focus on the recommendation algorithm that has been developed on top of the ontology, for providing the application developer with recommendations about the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering. The algorithm consists of: a) a matchmaking part, where the functional parameters of the application are taken into account to rule out inconsistent offerings, and b) a ranking part, where the non-functional parameters of the application are considered to score and rank offerings. Τhe algorithm is extensively evaluated showing linear scalability to the number of offerings and application requirements. Furthermore, it is extensible upon future semantic model extensions, because it is agnostic to domain specific concepts and parameters, using SPARQL template queries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The industry is constantly moving towards the research, implementation and deployment of new solutions that permit the optimization of processes. Nowadays, such solutions consist mostly on ICT developments, which permit the collection, distribution, integration, analysis, and manipulation of heterogeneous data. The under way Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project targets the development of cloud-enabled tools for supporting the SMEs supply network optimization of manufacturing and logistic assets. The C2NET solution includes the implementation of paradigms as e.g. cloud computing or service-oriented and event-driven architectures, used for wide data integration. Among its requirements, the C2NET platform needs a solution for catch, process and react to events triggered in different locations of collaborative manufacturing networks, which are endowed with devices that permits the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This paper presents the architecture and main functionality of a knowledge-based approach that allows processing supply chain events handled by CPS devices. The main component of the presented solution is the SECA ontology, which is a knowledge base that can be updated at runtime. The main purpose of the ontology is to describe events, their status and the actions to be performed once a set of events are triggered in certain order. This research work offers a solution that can be employed by the C2NET platform not only to catch and process events; but also to notify linked data consumers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This work proposes to include security and privacy into to context of Linked Open Data (LOD) and the Semantic Web. Here, a database partitioning approach to logically and physically separate data and distribute the partitions across several different cloud providers is applied. This data distribution is called fixed vertical partitioning and distribution approach (FVPD), as data schemes are vertically partitioned and distributed across various different cloud providers. Hence, this framework uses a security-by-distribution approach to storing sensitive data securely and privacy-ware in all possible cloud deployment models and thus, it provides a solution to improve the level of security and privacy. The proposed FVPD approach also becomes viable in the context of LOD and the Semantic Web. Furthermore, in relevant literature no approach in this context has been dealing with security and privacy so far. Therefore, this work transfers the FVPD approach from relational databases to Semantic Web Frameworks (Apache Jena, Sesame, etc.) that provide storage engines for RDF data and corresponding SPARQL endpoints. Above that, the query performance of such a federated environment is compared to a non-partitioned and non-distributed environment. For this, an adapted version of the TPC-W benchmark is used. Thus, this work shows how the query performance is affected when relational database data are exposed as SPARQL endpoints in RDF-based form and how the FVPD approach influences the query performance. Finally, it illustrates a mechanism to improve the level of security and privacy through a security-by-distribution approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this project we propose a new approach for emotion recognition using web-based similarity (e.g. confidence, PMI and PMING). We aim to extract basic emotions from short sentences with emotional content (e.g. news titles, tweets, captions), performing a web-based quantitative evaluation of semantic proximity between each word of the analyzed sentence and each emotion of a psychological model (e.g. Plutchik, Ekman, Lovheim). The phases of the extraction include: text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine automated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of semantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The main idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under the assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search engines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through tags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions. Training results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative tests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g. Kendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to each single word. Different from sentiment analysis, our approach works at a deeper level of abstraction, aiming to recognize specific emotions and not only the positive/negative sentiment, in order to predict emotions as semantic data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The spread of high-speed networks changes the way in which organizations manage information. Distributed environments, such as multi-cloud environments, can be exploited by users belonging to different organizations. Companies are realizing that they can achieve significant cost savings by outsourcing some of their information technology environments to specialized service companies. This rapid transition has introduced a number of security risks and challenges. The resulting environment cannot succeed at addressing them without the use of access control policies and the definition of trust mechanisms. Access control ontologies, as a structured way to represent real word elements, are widely employed for making the security interoperable and understandable. Ontologies that have been built for this aim suffer from the lack of crucial elements for distributed environments. In this paper, we tackle the problem of trust-based access control models. We define a list of trust elements that should be integrated into any access control ontology. We also provide a mapping technique that permits the exchange of trust information. Based on these two contributions, our reputation mechanism, that builds upon the organization-based access control model (OrBAC), is created. To prove the efficiency of our proposal, we test it in a multi-cloud environment. Then, we conduct a set of experiments that show the high accuracy level of our system.

AB  - Open Data now provides access to updated data dedicated to urban development. The traditional approach of using production data for decision on land management needs to be rethought in the light of these new opportunities and should therefore addressed towards dynamic management of geographic information. Institutional sites such as INSEE semantically annotate their data facilitating the discovery of contextual data. Linked Open Data cloud network offers semantic access to a huge amount of thematic data including an important geographic subset. These new opportunities always generate a greater amount of usable data. Big Data tools, like Spark, make it easy to handle this amount unbounded data via conventional data-mining algorithms. We group all these issues under the generic name of Cloud Data that has sense only if it is integrated perfectly into a cloud computing environment for efficient processing and reactive application (SaaS application, Restfull services, D3JS library,..). We offer an example of a dedicated application for the Pau urban community in which all Cloud Data is integrated as a SaaS (Software as a Service). © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fuzzy knowledge is prevalent in real life, and ontology is the main way of knowledge representation in semantic web. In this paper, two main kinds of common fuzzy knowledge are sorted out, and there is a great significance for ontology representation of common fuzzy knowledge in semantic web. In addition, searching knowledge in ontology is the most common operation of semantic web, but heterogeneous ontologies seriously affect accuracy of information retrieval, and ontology mapping is the key to solve the problem. Therefore, in this paper, firstly an ontology representation method of common fuzzy knowledge is presented. Common fuzzy knowledge is polytypic and includes most commonly used fuzzy knowledge in reality. So fuzzy sets and Cloud Model are used to reflect and represent these 2 types of common fuzzy knowledge in ontology. Then, based on the ontology representation method of common fuzzy knowledge mentioned above, a corresponding algorithm of ontology mapping is presented, which is based on similarity calculation of concepts and Support Vector Machine. The proposed methods extend the scope of ontology application and are significant for information retrieval of fuzzy knowledge in the semantic web. The experiments show that the proposed methods are practicable and effective. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Research supervision services like providing study materials can be enhanced through mobile information retrieval algorithms. An example is semantic searching algorithms, which require the user to input one or two real world concepts. Systems that implement mobile learning approaches like ambient learning can use semantic searching algorithms to support research supervision services through mobile phones. However, there is low adoption of such approaches in some of the African universities. This has been attributed to limited technical limitations of mobile devices that include mobile phones. For instance, complex interfaces, restricted input and small screens on mobile phones make it difficult to enter search keywords when the user is in a hurry. As an attempt to address these limitations, this paper describes dynamic heuristics - greedy search algorithm that automatically generate search keywords. The algorithm can be used to allow flexible mobile information retrieval on a typical ambient learning system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It is generally conceded that by embracing the cloud computing paradigm enterprises are able to boost their agility and productivity whilst realising significant cost savings. However, many enterprises are reluctant to adopt cloud services for supporting their critical operations due to security and privacy concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise a set of policies that infuse adequate security controls in cloud services. However, the heterogeneous nature of these services, together with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinders the formulation of an effective and interoperable set of policies that is suitable for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work proposes an approach to the construction of ontological templates for the semantic representation of policies. These templates are capable of capturing the knowledge that must be infused into a policy in order for it to adequately take into account the needs of the underlying domain of application in which it is to be enforced.

AB  - Utilizing online learning resources (OLR) from multi channels in learning activities promise extended benefits from traditional based learning-centred to a collaborative based learning-centred that emphasises pervasive learning anywhere and anytime. While compiling big data, cloud computing, and semantic web into OLR offer a broader spectrum of pervasive knowledge acquisition to enrich users’ experience in learning. In conventional learning practices, a student is perceived as a recipient of information and knowledge. However, nowadays students are empowered to involve in learning processes that play an active role in creating, extracting, and improving OLR collaborative learning platform and knowledge sharing as well as distributing. Researchers have employed contents analysis for reviewing literatures in peer-reviewed journals and interviews with the teachers who utilize OLR. In fact, researchers propose pervasive knowledge can address the need of integrating technologies like cloud computing, big data, Web 2.0, and Semantic Web. Pervasive knowledge redefines value added, variety, volume, and velocity of OLR, which is flexible in terms of resources adoption, knowledge acquisition, and technological implementation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing technology is a new paradigm which provides Information Technology (IT) resources via the Internet. This new shift in the way that IT re-sources are offered to the user brings new challenges, such as cloud service discovery. Nowadays, cloud users are faced with a dilemma as they have an abundant choice of cloud services. Moreover, many cloud providers offer a range of services which deliver similar functionality. Locating the best and most appropriate cloud service with a suitable and capable provider is a primary concern for any consumer. In order to clearly comprehend the scope of this problem, a thorough analysis of the limitations of cloud service discovery approaches is required which, in turn, will empower researchers to deliver better solutions for consumers to make an informed decision and choose the right service. This paper presents an overview of the current cloud service discovery trends and challenges in recent studies. Additionally, the reviewed approaches are classified according to service discovery architecture and techniques. Furthermore, these approaches are compared and analysed from several perspectives including approach model/architecture, service type, ontology representation (domain, language, and reasoning), dynamic discovery model, evaluation model, user's preferences techniques, data updates, and public repositories. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hybrid cloud computing paradigm is gaining wide acceptance to multi-faceted IT organizations to meet the users' different sets of requirements for different types of applications. However, this can also create an array of issues, such as complex architectures, security, service provisioning in cases of resources failures/disaster, etc. To mitigate the impact and minimize trade-offs, we proposed an ontology-based framework to provide support for a resiliency mechanism in the hybrid cloud. We adopted ontology technology to provide a unified representations of cloud service names to facilitate the discovery and selection of the best-match cloud service in cases of failures. As types of cloud services evolve over time, we adopted ontology clustering to speed up the search process. Preliminary experiment results provided promising results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is provisioned with high flexibility with regard to on demand infrastructures, platforms and software as services through the Internet. The unique characteristics of cloud services such as dynamic and diverse services offering at different levels, as well as the lack of standardized description, are becoming important challenges in efficiently discovering cloud services for customers. In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that has the capability to automatically identify cloud services aiming at improving the accuracy when searching cloud services in real environments. Our search engine can detect cloud services effectively from the Web sources. Furthermore, we focus on learning the cloud service features, such as similarity function, semantic ontology and cloud service components to identify the cloud services. We use a real cloud service dataset to build an identifier. Our cloud service identifier can be used to automatically determine whether a given Web source is a cloud service with high accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The concept of the cloud is no longer limited to providing remote hardware or platform support with the development of cloud computing technology. Instead, it encapsulates all aspects of the content in computer field into service invoked by others. As an important part of software, data resource has become core services to the cloud platform in areas such as collaborative manufacturing and collaborative service. Since these data are complex in structure, strongly independent but related to each other, it is necessary to annotate these data to improve their operability and make them able to be utilized more widely. This paper wants to design an annotation method based on word segmentation and semantics replacement aimed at metadata according to the characteristics of the meta-data itself. As a result, these data resource can then be understood by computers and further support later studies such as data fusion and semantic retrieval. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the development of information technology, the resource description framework (RDF) occupies very important position in structure of the semantic web. An effective way to enhance the efficiency of the RDF data query is RDF closures. Our work is improve the RDF reasoning in MapReduce framework. The algorithm is based on packet classification efficiency of a few of candidate rules, as well as the NoSQL data storage avoiding repetition, corresponding to the RDF properties and concepts. The optimization algorithm of MapReduce is given a new closure generation process. Our approach use RDFS inference rules and the RDF triples in relationship between Map and Reduce operations and generate the RDF closures, improve the generate efficiency of closure. Based on RDF MapReduce algorithm for RDF closure, look forward more suitable RDF closure computing scheme on cloud computing environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is a reasonable method for solving complex functions. In previous years, it has been extensively applied in cloud computing environments, such as cloud resource schedules and privacy management. However, this algorithm can easily fall into local minimum points and has a slow convergence speed. Using an established ontology model, we proposed a framework and two novel PSO algorithms in this paper. The ontology model is introduced with various types of operators to the cooperation framework. In contrast with traditional algorithms, our algorithms include semantic roles and concepts to update crucial parameters based on the cooperation framework. Using function optimization problems as examples, the experiments show that the particle swarm algorithms within our framework are superior to other classical algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is advantageous for customers and service providers. However, it has specific security requirements that are not captured by traditional access control models, e.g., secure information sharing in dynamic and collaborative environments. Risk-based access control models try to overcome these limitations, but while there are well-known enforcement mechanisms for traditional access control, this is not the case for risk-based policies. In this paper, we motivate the use of risk-based access control in the cloud and present a framework for enforcing risk-based policies that is based on an extension of XACML. We also instantiate this framework using a new ontology-based risk assessment approach, as well as other models from related work, and present experimental results of the implementation of our work. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has become an increasingly popular topic in recent years. It has provided alternatives for designing and implementing robot or intelligent space platform. Compared with traditional approaches where users purchase a robot and manage its own hardware or software on an ongoing basis. While researchers wish to transform their computing resources infrastructure into cloud, whether as virtual computing resources in a private cloud, virtual computing resources in a public cloud, physical computing resources, or as a combination of all these different resources in a hybrid cloud infrastructure. In this paper, a hybrid cloud robot framework is presented. An open source software named Apache CloudStack designed to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. We also proposed a knowledge representation method for service robots, where knowledge is represented hierarchically and described in ontology web language. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The cloud is a technology that provides environment or software such as IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. This requires a technique for storing and managing environment or software as a service, because this may cause problems as redundancy of services and data. In this paper, we want to resolve the problem caused by the duplication using the ontology. It suggested a way that can be used in combination with the service by providing the system model and the service template for it. We verified the effectiveness of this system by comparing the execution time of the application system and increasing the cloud node. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on providing services or sharing resources in a cloud computing environment is increasing. The problems of this environment are discovery of service and data collision for either sharing data or services. This paper suggests an ontology-based service integration system model efficient in service discovery and free from data collision between services. Thus, we define a logical hierarchical model of service integration. The ontology consists of service ontology and data ontology, which are the basis of efficient service management and resolving data collision to provide semantic association of data and service. This can be efficient in service integration of SaaS in a cloud computing environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The dramatically growing demand of Cyber Physical and Social Computing (CPSC) has enabled a variety of novel channels to reach services in the financial industry. Combining cloud systems with multimedia big data is a novel approach for Financial Service Institutions (FSIs) to diversify service offerings in an efficient manner. However, the security issue is still a great issue in which the service availability often conflicts with the security constraints when the service media channels are varied. This paper focuses on this problem and proposes a novel approach using the Semantic-Based Access Control (SBAC) techniques for acquiring secure financial services on multimedia big data in cloud computing. The proposed approach is entitled IntercroSsed Secure Big Multimedia Model (2SBM), which is designed to secure accesses between various media through the multiple cloud platforms. The main algorithms supporting the proposed model include the Ontology-Based Access Recognition (OBAR) Algorithm and the Semantic Information Matching (SIM) Algorithm.We implement an experimental evaluation to prove the correctness and adoptability of our proposed scheme. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is an emerging topic in the information technology sector. The rapid evolution of this technology led to the emergence of new interaction models between its actors. However, the absence of a universally accepted format of the service level agreement (SLA) governing the relationships between the different actors of cloud increases its complexity. In addition, the dynamic nature of the cloud could lead to severe SLA violations. This undesirable but currently unavoidable situation may lead to penalizing providers and forcing customers to evaluate their SLAs permanently. In this paper, we propose a generic and semantically richer ontology-based model for SLA to improve its definition and its evaluation in cloud computing. Through this model, we have developed a prototype to validate our model and our monitoring process where SLA evaluation and guarantee actions triggering are automatically performed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In cloud computing, searchable encryption scheme over outsourced data is a hot research field. However, most existing works on encrypted search over outsourced cloud data follow the model of 'one size fits all' and ignore personalized search intention. Moreover, most of them support only exact keyword search, which greatly affects data usability and user experience. So how to design a searchable encryption scheme that supports personalized search and improves user search experience remains a very challenging task. In this paper, for the first time, we study and solve the problem of personalized multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data (PRSE) while preserving privacy in cloud computing. With the help of semantic ontology WordNet, we build a user interest model for individual user by analyzing the user's search history, and adopt a scoring mechanism to express user interest smartly. To address the limitations of the model of 'one size fit all' and keyword exact search, we propose two PRSE schemes for different search intentions. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate our analysis and show that our proposed solution is very efficient and effective. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) adopts and extends the concept of cloud computing to make mass Manufacturing Resources and Capabilities (MR/Cs) more widely integrated and accessible to users through the Internet. However, a single manufacturing cloud (MC) has limited MR/Cs, due to both economic and technical constraints, and can only provide limited manufacturing services in terms of function, price, and reliability, etc. Using the aggregated MR/Cs or services of multiple MCs is a natural evolution, i.e., MCs can satisfy peak demands for MR/Cs through collaboration, while users can have a wider selection of services from multiple MCs. To address such requirements, we propose a hybrid framework for integrating multiple MCs. The key functional modules and the business models of the proposed framework are presented to guide future integration of MCs. The enabling technologies, such as semantic web and ontologies, intelligent agents, service-oriented architecture, and materials handling and logistics technologies are also discussed. A case study is given, showing the feasibility and rationality of the proposed approach. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the last years we have seen a dramatic increase of new Cloud providers, applications, services, management platforms, data, etc. reaching a level of complexity that implies the necessity of new solutions to deal with such vast, shared and heterogeneous services and resources. Consequently, challenges often related to interoperability, portability, security, discovery, selection, negotiation and description of cloud service and resource may take place. In this sense, Semantic Web Technologies, holding a great potential to cloud computing, have been proven as an efficient means to relive these challenges. This paper examines and explores the role of Semantic Web Technologies in the cloud from a wide variety of literatures. Various approaches, architectures, and frameworks are screened and evaluated based on eight prime research questions. At the end of the review, research opportunities in the form of a roadmap are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is one of the happening technologies in these years and gives scope to lot of research ideas. Banks are likely to enter the cloud computing field because of abundant advantages offered by cloud like reduced IT costs, pay-per-use modeling, and business agility and green IT. Main challenges to be addressed while moving bank to cloud are security breach, governance, and Service Level Agreements (SLA). Banks should not give prospect for security breaches at any cost. Access control and authorization are vivacious solutions to security risks. Thus we are proposing a knowledge based security model addressing the present issue. Separate ontologies for subject, object, and action elements are created and an authorization rule is framed by considering the inter linkage between those elements to ensure data security with restricted access. Moreover banks are now using Software as a Service (SaaS), which is managed by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Banks rely upon the security measures provided by CSPs. If CSPs follow traditional security model, then the data security will be a big question. Our work facilitates the bank to pose some security measures on their side along with the security provided by the CSPs. Banks can add and delete rules according to their needs and can have control over the data in addition to CSPs. We also showed the performance analysis of our model and proved that our model provides secure access to bank data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As a recent emerging industry, cybersecurity insurance has been growing ambitiously fast, which mainly serves the financial industry and assists financial firms to reduce cybersecurity risks. Understanding the risk classification is an important hemisphere for operating cybersecurity insurance. However, the classification representation will be complicated when the service system becomes large. Improper presentation of the risks can result in financial loss or operational mistakes. This paper addresses this concern and proposes an approach using ontology-based knowledge representation for cybersecurity insurance. The approach is named as Semantic Cyber Incident Classification (SCIC) model, which uses knowledge representation deriving from semantic techniques. Our approach is specifically designed for targeting at cybersecurity insurance domain, which has been assessed by our experiments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyberlearning is challenged by the lack of personal and assessment-driven learning, and students are often puzzled by the lack of instructor guidance and feedback, the huge volume and diversity of the learning materials, and thelack of the ability to zoom in from the general concepts to the more specific ones, or the opposite. Intelligent tutoring systems are needed to improve the cyberlearning quality. One of the major difficulties is knowledge representation. The current industry standard is to use Web Ontology Language (OWL) forrepresenting knowledge structure. But OWL only supports one "first-class" relation, "is-a", between the concepts, and different knowledge areas usually need different custom relations to describe the relations among the concepts. For example "part-of" and time dependency are important relations torepresent most engineering knowledge bodies. OWL has to use object properties to emulate such custom relations, leading to awkward knowledge representation hard for domain experts to code, validate and use such knowledge bases. This research uses Pace University's extension to OWL, named Knowledge Graph (KG), to support knowledge representation with custom relations. The instructors can use Pace University extended Protege IDE to declare and apply custom relations in a single document. The instructor teaching experience is also coded in the KG to better support custom learning order by students with different backgrounds. The prototype of a knowledge-driven tutoring system was designed and implemented to illustrate how the KG supports integrated assessments, using assessment results to custom student learning order or material, and let the students freely navigate in the knowledge space from general to specific or the opposite, and following various custom relations. A web technology tutorial is used to validate the design and effectiveness of this approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Different companies in the same line of business can have similar computer systems with built-in diagnostic routines, and the ability to regularly send error-driven or event-driven environmental diagnostic messages in XML backto the system manufacturer. The system manufacturer typically uses these to determine faults in the system. The outcome of this troubleshooting can also assist end-users and clients in solving problems, and provide the production team valuable information that can be used to improve future versions of the product. A Company merger could lead to the same team processing diagnostic messages from similar but different products, in different syntax, leading to complexity explosion of specifying and maintaining diagnostic message pattern specification and recognition for many different syntaxes. This research reduces the above complexity by extending ISO Schematron, the industry standard language for XML semantic constraints specification and validation, with conceptual rules. Pace University Knowledge Graphs are used to describe the concepts or classes relevant to the diagnostic messages of a system, and the new conceptual Schematron rules are introduced to specify diagnostic patterns on these concepts. Such conceptual diagnostic patterns are then converted automatically into concrete Schematron rules based on the syntax of the specific diagnostic messages. A complete prototype was designed and implemented to validate this new methodology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyber Security breaches and attacks are on the ascendancy as corporations, governments, universities, and private individuals are conducting their business and personal transactions on the web. This increasing participating on the web necessitates that robust and efficient cyber security systems need to be put in place by these entities to safeguard their cyber assets. Intelligent Systems needs to be employed to buttress the cyber security protocols established in cloud computing for proper decision-making, which may depend on the effective knowledge representation. However, as one of the dominant industry standards for knowledge representation, Web Ontology Language (OWL) has limitations, such as the lack of support for custom relations. Pace University has extended OWL to support Knowledge Graph as a replacement to better support knowledge representation and decision making. This paper examines using KG as the basis in the design of a knowledge-representation system that drives the filtration process of a company's cyber security ecosystem in cloud computing by employing a use case of cyber security communications in-order to identify the entity relations of threat types for the filtration process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Drug side effects data contains important constraints about side-effects and conflict avoidance of component and compound drug. These are critically important in checking out prescriptions to avoid complications. Current drug data side effect representations in XML does not have a proper knowledge representation mechanism to clearly specify all kinds of dependencies among the drug components and drugs. Therefore Doctors and caregivers often rely on human interpretation to check prescriptions which can be error-prone. The recently introduced Web Ontology Language (OWL) based approach for medical drug side effects data representation still suffers from several shortcomings inherent to the OWL restrictions like using " is-a " relationship and usage of object property based workarounds losing the clarity and dynamic relationship building expected by domain experts to represent knowledge. The proposed model Drug-Side Effects Representation And Inferencing (D-SERI) built using Knowledge Graph (KG) and enhanced PaceJena shows that the proposed model allowsthe doctors and caregivers to derive dynamic information about side effects avoiding costly errors caused by human interpretation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the past decade, the role of data has increased exponentially from something that is queried or reported on, to becoming a true corporate asset. The same time period has also seen marked growth in corporate structural complexity. This combination has lead to information management challenges, as the data moving across a multitude of systems lends itself to a higher likelihood of impacting dependent processes and systems, should something go wrong or be changed. Many enterprise data projects are faced with low success rates and consequently subject to high amounts of scrutiny as senior leadership struggles to identify return on investment. While there are many tools and methods to increase a companies' ability to govern data, this research is based on the premise that you can not govern what you do not know. This lack of awareness of the corporate data landscape impacts the ability to govern data, which in turn impacts overall data quality within organizations. This paper seeks to propose a tools and techniques for companies to better gain an awareness of the landscape of their data, processes, and organizational attributes through the use of linked data, via the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and ontology. The outcome of adopting such techniques is an increased level of data awareness within the organization, resulting in improved ability to govern corporate data assets, and in turn increased data quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Developing countries have very high patients-per-doctor ratios. Therefore, analysing the adaptability of self-care for developing countries is of prime importance. We have investigated how health posts and pharmacies could promote self-care in developing countries. We have restricted ourselves on the ways these organizations could assist patients in exploiting health-oriented network services such as Personal Health Records (PHRs) and public medical data sources. Our ultimate goal is to promote information therapy (Ix) as it aims to prescribe the right information to right people at right time. In our solution, Ix is carried out by a SPARQL engine, which is capable for accessing PHRs and other medical data sources within a query. Thus we can augment patient's data in PHR by external data sources. Such automatic augmentation is based on the overlapping ontologies that model PHRs' data as well the data in public medical data sources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In big data environment, the key of smart tourism information system is the method of semantic description and link construction to complete intensive, intelligent and unified management of tourism. We proposed a hierarchical semantic description framework of tourism Linked Data, which consists of 4 layers: Metadata Layer, Ontology Layer, Linked Data Layer, Data application Layer. Main roles of these layers and their relations are described. A RDF Link approach between tourism Linked Data is presented to build the semantic association of tourism Linked Data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing becomes more effective and prevalent on basis of economy. Data owners outsource their data to cloud which contain more sensitive information. To provide security and privacy, such sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing. It also becomes challenge to search over encrypted data. Here we consider that a large number of data users and document files in cloud and there must be a search service that allows multiple keyword queries and generates ranked results of retrieved files. In this paper, we propose a multi-keyword search scheme that not only enable document keyword search but also supports linear, gram based and semantic searches. We construct a special tree-based index structure and propose a fuzzy Search Server that creates wild card based fuzzy keyword Set which overcome KGA (Keyword Guessing Attack) and provide efficient multi-keyword ranked search. KNN algorithm is used to encrypt the index and query. It also uses the relevance score calculation for ranking the documents. Majority of computing work is done on the server side and all operations performed only on cipher text and hence there is no information leakage thus ensuring data security. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Linked data mining has become one of the key questions in HPC graph mining in recent years. However, the existing RDF database engines are not scalable and are less reliable in heterogeneous clouds. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Acacia-RDF which is a scalable distributed RDF graph database engine developed with X10 programming language to solve this issue. Acacia-RDF partitions the RDF data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable SPARQL processor for Acacia-RDF which operates on top of partitioned RDF data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the implementation of scalable graph algorithms such as Triangle counting with such partitioned data sets. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of LUBM RDF benchmark data sets and make a comparison of Acacia's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-RDF scales well with LUBM data sets. Acacia-RDF reported approximately 2 seconds elapsed time on 4 places for running the first and third queries of the LUBM benchmark on LUBM scale 40 data set. Through this work we introduce the use of X10 language for scalable RDF graph data management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, cloud computing is an emerging technology thanks to its ability to provide on-demand computing services (hardware and software) with less description standardization effort. Multiple issues and challenges in discovering cloud services appear due to the lack of the cloud service description standardization. In fact, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services while proposing ontologies. However, since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology (CSO), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. This paper contribution is threefold. First, it specifies a set of patterns and anti-patterns in order to evaluate CSO. Second, it defines an anti-pattern detection method based on SPARQL queries which provides a set of correction recommendations to help ontologists revise the ontology. Finally, some experiment tests were conducted in relation to: (i) the method efficiency and (ii) anti-pattern detection of design anomalies as well as taxonomic and domain errors within CSO. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increase in the number of cloud services and service providers, manual analysis of Service Level Agreements (SLA), comparison between different service offerings and conformance regulation has become a difficult task for customers. Cloud SLAs are policy documents describing the legal agreement between cloud providers and customers. SLA specifies the commitment of availability, performance of services, penalties associated with violations and procedure for customers to receive compensations in case of service disruptions. The aim of our research is to develop technology solutions for automated cloud service management using Semantic Web and Text Mining techniques. In this paper we discuss in detail the challenges in automating cloud services management and present our preliminary work in extraction of knowledge from SLAs of different cloud services. We extracted two types of information from the SLA documents which can be useful for end users. First, the relationship between the service commitment and financial credit. We represented this information by enhancing the existing Cloud service ontology proposed by us in our previous research. Second, we extracted rules in the form of obligations and permissions from SLAs using modal and deontic logic formalizations. For our analysis, we considered six publicly available SLA documents from different cloud computing service providers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the advent of Cloud Computing, organizations are increasingly migrating their information and communication technology (ICT) resources to the cloud. This has recently gained a great attention because of cloud pay-as-you-go model which drastically reduces actual IT infrastructure with high performance and continuous availability. In order to effectively utilize existing cloud resources, organizations may look for available cloud resources from different cloud providers. However, cloud resources are heterogeneous and described by different standards which prevents an easy and dynamic interoperability between organizations. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework tackling this heterogeneity issue. We develop a set of ontologies to semantically represent cloud resources by looking at three cloud resource description standards: Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA), Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), and Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI). Hence, our framework promotes the creation of a common semantic knowledge base of cloud resources described using these different standards. This knowledge base allows a seamless translation of cloud providers' resource descriptions. We developed an application to validate our approach as a proof of concept. We also evaluated the feasibility and completeness of our semantic framework on use cases obtained from standard specifications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Consumers want to ensure that their enterprise data is stored securely and obliviously on the cloud, such that the data objects or their access patterns are not revealed to anyone, including the cloud provider, in the public cloud environment. We have created a detailed ontology describing the oblivious cloud storage models and role based access controls that should be in place to manage this risk. We have developed an algorithm to store cloud data using oblivious data structure defined in this paper. We have also implemented the ObliviCloudManager application that allows users to manage their cloud data by validating it before storing it in an oblivious data structure. Our application uses role-based access control model and collection based document management to store and retrieve data efficiently. Cloud consumers can use our system to define policies for storing data obliviously and manage storage on untrusted cloud platforms even if they are unfamiliar with the underlying technology and concepts of oblivious data structures. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Linked Data storage solutions often optimize for low latency querying and quick responsiveness. Meanwhile, in the back-end, offline ETL processes take care of integrating and preparing the data. In this paper we explain a workflow and the results of a benchmark that examines which Linked Data storage solution and setup should be chosen for different dataset sizes to optimize the cost-effectiveness of the entire ETL process. The benchmark executes diversified stress tests on the storage solutions. The results include an in-depth analysis of four mature Linked Data solutions with commercial support and full SPARQL 1.1 compliance. Whereas traditional benchmarks studies generally deploy the triple stores on premises using high-end hardware, this benchmark uses publicly available cloud machine images for reproducibility and runs on commodity hardware. All stores are tested using their default configuration. In this setting Virtuoso shows the best performance in general. The other tree stores show competitive results and have disjunct areas of excellence. Finally, it is shown that each store's performance heavily depends on the structural properties of the queries, giving an indication of where vendors can focus their optimization efforts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Platform as a Service (PaaS) model of Cloud Computing is at an early stage of adoption in spite of its perceived benefits, especially in speeding up the development cycle of Cloud-aware applications. Wider adoption of this service model is impeded by multiple inhibitors, one of which is a lack of interoperability between proprietary services of public PaaS providers. The paper presents the state-of-the-art of PaaS interoperability initiatives from industry and academia. Although these initiatives evidence interest in solving the issue, they are focused either on system infrastructure services or on enabling application portability. PaaS service interoperability has not received much attention yet. Aim: The paper proposes a Semantic-Agent framework as an effective solution for spanning multiple public PaaSs and integrating differentiated application infrastructure services. The proposed interoperability framework will be independent of specific offerings and targeted at the needs of developers. Methodology: This PhD (of which the current study is a subset) encompasses three primary tasks. First, an OWL-S based ontology for semantic annotation of PaaS services will be designed. Second, a multi-agent mechanism will be devised to enable semantic matching and composition of services. Third, a proof-of-concept solution that is able to span multiple public PaaSs and establish service interoperability will be developed. Contribution: The two main contributions of this research are: i) establishing a comprehensive ontology for PaaS services supporting Cloud application development, and ii) devising a novel framework enabling their interoperability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Adaptivity is an essential quality for any mobile learning process. When learning on the move, in short time intervals, the learning process is often limited, and content needs to be adapted in order to keep the interactions with the user simple, effective, and motivating. This paper presents a model for mobile adaptive language learning, with the main goal of improving the mobile language learning process using adaptive techniques. The presented model is designed in such a way to utilize unique opportunities for delivery of learning content in authentic learning situations. In order to allow adaptivity based on several parameters, an ontological framework is presented along with a format of lightweight learning objects for content delivery. A cloud and web-service based system for adaptation is envisioned on top of the ontological framework and presented, with some implementation suggestions and possibilities discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper introduces an open, interoperable, and cloud-computing-based citizen engagement platform for the management of administrative processes of public administrations, which also increases the engagement of citizens. The citizen engagement platform is the outcome of a 3-year Italian national project called PRISMA (Interoperable cloud platforms for smart government; http://www.ponsmartcities-prisma.it/). The aim of the project is to constitute a new model of digital ecosystem that can support and enable new methods of interaction among public administrations, citizens, companies, and other stakeholders surrounding cities. The platform has been defined by the media as a flexible (enable the addition of any kind of application or service) and open (enable access to open services) Italian “cloud” that allows public administrations to access to a vast knowledge base represented as linked open data to be reused by a stakeholder community with the aim of developing new applications (“Cloud Apps”) tailored to the specific needs of citizens. The platform has been used by Catania and Syracuse municipalities, two of the main cities of southern Italy, located in the Sicilian region. The fully adoption of the platform is rapidly spreading around the whole region (local developers have already used available application programming interfaces (APIs) to create additional services for citizens and administrations) to such an extent that other provinces of Sicily and Italy in general expressed their interest for its usage. The platform is available online and, as mentioned above, is open source and provides APIs for full exploitation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the recent years great interest has been shown by both private organizations and independent researchers on Business Processes definition and management, which resulted in the development of several tools for their design and execution, and in proposals of standards for their formal representation, such as BPMN. At the same time, Cloud Computing solutions have reached a good level of maturity, with a high number of services and offers currently available to customers who, in turn, would benefit from a tool suggesting the most suitable Cloud services to leverage according to their specific requirements. In this paper a tentative approach for the mapping of Business requirements (expressed through BPMN diagrams) to Cloud services is proposed. In particular, semantic-web technologiessuch as OWL are proposed to ease the mapping process and to suggest users the best suitable Cloud services to leverage and compose. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents recent progresses made in using scalable cloud computing environment, Hadoop and MapReduce, to perform ontology quality assurance (OQA), and points to areas of future opportunity. The standard sequential approach used for implementing OQA methods can take weeks if not months for exhaustive analyses for large biomedical ontological systems. With OQA methods newly implemented using massively parallel algorithms in the MapReduce framework, several orders of magnitude in speed-up can be achieved (e.g., from three months to three hours). Such dramatically reduced time makes it feasible not only to perform exhaustive structural analysis of large ontological hierarchies, but also to systematically track structural changes between versions for evolutional analysis. As an exemplar, progress is reported in using MapReduce to perform evolutional analysis and visualization on the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), a prominent clinical terminology system. Future opportunities in three areas are described: one is to extend the scope of MapReduce-based approach to existing OQA methods, especially for automated exhaustive structural analysis. The second is to apply our proposed MapReduce Pipeline for Lattice-based Evaluation (MaPLE) approach, demonstrated as an exemplar method for SNOMED CT, to other biomedical ontologies. The third area is to develop interfaces for reviewing results obtained by OQA methods and for visualizing ontological alignment and evolution, which can also take advantage of cloud computing technology to systematically pre-compute computationally intensive jobs in order to increase performance during user interactions with the visualization interface. Advances in these directions are expected to better support the ontological engineering lifecycle. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing elderly population and the shift from acute to chronic illness makes it difficult to care for people in hospitals and rest homes. Moreover, elderly people, if given a choice, want to stay at home as long as possible. In this article, the methodologies to develop a cloud-based semantic system, offering valuable information and knowledge-based services, are presented. The information and services are related to the different personal living hemispheres of the patient, namely the daily care-related needs, the social needs and the daily life assistance. Ontologies are used to facilitate the integration, analysis, aggregation and efficient use of all the available data in the cloud. By using an interdisciplinary research approach, where user researchers, (ontology) engineers, researchers and domain stakeholders are at the forefront, a platform can be developed of great added value for the patients that want to grow old in their own home and for their caregivers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registry is widely used for organizing Web services in the Internet, but it cannot meet the requirement of organizing massive Web services in the cloud computing environment. In this paper, a Web service registration cloud based on structured P2P and semantics (PSSRC) is presented. On the one hand, PSSRC works on a structured P2P overlay which is organized by using Pastry in multiple registration nodes, where each registration node is composed of seven modules namely system configuration, schedule and distribution, P2P communication, access and control, UDDI, resources monitoring, and semantic process. On the other hand, a semantic ontology database named WordNet is used to process semantic queries in PSSRC. PSSRC inherits the advantage of UDDI in that the registration and discovery of Web services are transparent to Web services providers. Furthermore, it is shown by experiment that the capacity of PSSRC can be extended dynamically, and both semantic queries and large scalable accesses are well supported. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we present a problem/solution system based on logic formula calculation scheme preserving the user's privacy. Semantic computing extends semantic Web both in breadth and depth. This article discusses the essences of semantic computing with a description of semantic services. The logic formula calculation schemes are an indispensable technique currently. However, suppose these schemes are served in cloud computing services in near future, the users poses a significant risk to the privacy regarding to their problem, since a curious cloud administrator can follow the user's problem (query) and infer what the user is after. Indeed, in case where the user's intensions are to be kept secret, users are often cautious about using this services. In this paper we also discuss on a problem/solution system with the representative examples, such as biological analysis and simple logic reasoning together with the privacy preserving techniques. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Integration of products in enterprises comes with hard challenges due to several factors such as products developed in house, off the shelf, developed over different time lines, available as services over internet, ever changing product APIs, disconnected data models among the products, extensions developed by partners and customers and many more. We propose Semantic Data Platform (SDP), built around the semantics of the information derived out of product integration. This approach of semantic model based data sharing provides extreme loose coupling among products, makes extension of information from a given product possible with zero impact on rest of the system. Easy certification of integration enables evolution of products fairly independent of each other. SDP offers semantic federation and querying, therefore it can fetch any data irrespective of the product where the data lives. Thus, 'Any Data from a product can be offered as a Service'. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite recent advances in distributed RDF data management, processing large-amounts of RDF data in the cloud is still very challenging. In spite of its seemingly simple data model, RDF actually encodes rich and complex graphs mixing both instance and schema-level data. Sharding such data using classical techniques or partitioning the graph using traditional min-cut algorithms leads to very inefficient distributed operations and to a high number of joins. In this paper, we describe DiploCloud, an efficient and scalable distributed RDF data management system for the cloud. Contrary to previous approaches, DiploCloud runs a physiological analysis of both instance and schema information prior to partitioning the data. In this paper, we describe the architecture of DiploCloud, its main data structures, as well as the new algorithms we use to partition and distribute data. We also present an extensive evaluation of DiploCloud showing that our system is often two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art systems on standard workloads. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As we are moving rapidly to a digital economy, accessing and effectively using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in everyday life is widely recognized as an important requirement. However, the accessibility technologies that we have up to date are meeting the needs of only some, at a very high cost and, as a consequence, accessible ICT for all people still remains a major research and development goal. This work presents an integrated ontological framework for the semantic representation of terms and concepts (i.e., related to user needs and preferences (N&P) with respect to ICT use, as well as solutions, platforms and devices) that are required for addressing the universal accessibility in the scope of the Cloud4all project and the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII). Cloud4all aims at advancing and building upon the concept of GPII through the development of the necessary tools and models for making ICT accessible for all by exploiting the cloud computing paradigm. The main goal of the proposed framework lays in the separation between generalized accessibility concepts, user interaction mechanisms and N&P with the particular details of different ICT artifacts. Thus, the framework aims at integrating concepts related with user N&P, as well as ICT solutions, platforms, devices and their customizable settings along with information concerning their vendors or implementers, in order to (a) offer the necessary expressiveness for defining/representing personal N&P across applications, platforms and devices, (b) link N&P with the conditions/context according to which these shall be applicable for (e.g., considering the user activity and the physical environment), (c) link interaction requirements (originated from user characteristics) with N&P and (d) support the Cloud4all matchmaking process through the mapping between N&P and application-specific settings based on semantic rules and automatic reasoning techniques. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) represent a new generation of digital systems, where cyber entities and physical devices cooperate towards a set of common goals. The research presented in this paper aims to contribute to the development of CPSs by proposing: (1) an analysis methodology to model the CPS's behavior in terms of dependability; and (2) a CPS architecture with dependability facilities applicable in environmental monitoring, based on the Wireless Sensor Network, multi-agent and cloud computing technologies. The proposed methodology combines a primary dependability analysis technique with the representation of knowledge in order to support the development of CPSs capable to model the dependability at run-time. A dependability domain ontology has been implemented on a CPS case study based on this methodology and its effectiveness has been demonstrated, showing how the proposed approach is able to enhance system dependability. Also, the paper provides a detailed description of each architectural layer of the CPS case study, focusing on the wireless sensor node and on the intelligent decision system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing enables a revolutionary paradigm of consuming ICT services. However, due to the inadequately described service information, users often feel confused while trying to find the optimal services. Although some approaches are proposed to deal with cloud service retrieval and recommendation issues, they would only work for certain restricted scenarios in dealing with basic service specifications. Indeed, the missing extent is that most of the cloud services are "agile" whilst there are many vague service terms and descriptions. This paper proposes an agility-oriented and fuzziness-embedded cloud service ontology model, which adopts agility-centric design along with OWL2 (Web Ontology Language) fuzzy extensions. The captured cloud service specifications are maintained in an open and collaborative manner, as the fuzziness in the model accepts rating updates from users on the fly. The model enables comprehensive service specification by capturing cloud concept details and their interactions, even across multiple service categories and abstraction levels. Utilizing the model as a knowledge base, a service recommendation system prototype is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the approach can outperform existing practices by achieving effective service search, retrieval and recommendation outcomes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing environment is influenced by user-dependent quality of service (QoS) parameters in evaluating the performance of Web services apart from others factors. Among the performance QoS parameters, mainly response-time and throughput could be modulated to provide very efficient services for cloud users. As per user's requirement, the service provider's recommendation of appropriate Web services to the end-users with proper QoS satisfaction is one of the critical issues. This can be recommended to end-users in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) under Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) of WS-Policy. Generally, the matrix of collected QoS parameter values is sparse and the accurate prediction of the missing QoS values is important for the recommendation of appropriate web services to the end users. To address this issue, we worked out an artificial neural network model for the prediction of missing QoS-values using past QoS performance parameter data. In this current work, the performances of different learning algorithms of ANN are analyzed for enhanced prediction of QoS performance values. The ANN model with Bayesian-Regularization is found to be better performing when compared to other learning algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud monitoring is of a source of big data that are constantly produced from traces of infrastructures, platforms, and applications. Analysis of monitoring data delivers insights of the system's workload and usage pattern and ensures workloads are operating at optimum levels. The analysis process involves data query and extraction, data analysis, and result visualization. Since the volume of monitoring data is big, these operations require a scalable and reliable architecture to extract, aggregate, and analyze data in an arbitrary range of granularity. Ultimately, the results of analysis become the knowledge of the system and should be shared and communicated. This paper presents our cloud service architecture that explores a search cluster for data indexing and query. We develop REST APIs that the data can be accessed by different analysis modules. This architecture enables extensions to integrate with software frameworks of both batch processing (such as Hadoop) and stream processing (such as Spark) of big data. The analysis results are structured in Semantic Media Wiki pages in the context of the monitoring data source and the analysis process. This cloud architecture is empirically assessed to evaluate its responsiveness when processing a large set of data records under node failures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The adoption of the cloud paradigm to access IT resources and services has posed many security issues which need to be cared of. Security becomes even a much bigger concern when services built on top of many commercial clouds have to interoperate. Among others, the value of the service delivered to end customers is strongly affected by the security of network which providers are able to build in typical SOA contexts. Currently, every provider advertises its own security strategy by means of proprietary policies, which are sometimes ambiguous and very often address the security problem from a non-uniform perspective. Even policies expressed in standardized languages do not appear to fit a dynamic scenario like the SOA's, where services need to be sought and composed on the fly in a way that is compatible with the end-to-end security requirements. We then propose an approach that leverages on the semantic technology to enrich standardized security policies with an ad-hoc content. The semantic annotation of policies enables machine reasoning which is then used for both the discovery and the composition of security-enabled services. In the presented approach the semantic enrichment of policies is enforced by an automatic procedure. We further developed a semantic framework capable of matchmaking in a smart way security capabilities of providers and security requirements of customers, and tested it on a use case scenario. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Service discovery is one of the major challenges in cloud computing environment with a large number of service providers and heterogeneous services. Non-uniform naming conventions, varied types and features of services make cloud service discovery a grueling problem. With the proliferation of cloud services, it has been laborious to find services, especially from Internet-based service repositories. To address this issue, services are crawled and clustered according to their similarity. The clustered services are maintained as a catalogue in which the data published on the cloud provider’s website are stored in a standard format. As there is no standard specification and a description language for cloud services, new efficient and intelligent mechanisms to discover cloud services are strongly required and desired. This paper also proposes a key-value representation to describe cloud services in a formal way and to facilitate matching between offered services and demand. Since naïve users prefer to have a query in natural language, semantic approaches are used to close the gap between the ambiguous user requirements and the service specifications. Experimental evaluation measured in terms of precision and recall of retrieved services shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a challenge of developing computer programming visual language in the sphere of interdisciplinary research - cybernetics and philosophy, in particular, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of language and new area of the philosophical analysis - «philosophy of information". We consider the aspect «language - thinking" and the stages of developing interaction between a person and information environment by means of programs. We set up the problem concerning the necessity to find the ways of constructing software by nonprofessionals. We offer the efficient way to eliminate the distinction in the system «interface-software programming language" via using visual programming language as a tool for people to communicate with machine. We designate the prospects of using visual programming languages and difficulties in their creation and implementation. We conclude that developing cloud technologies opens up new opportunities to make cross-subject tools of creating and changing software functionality by people without professional qualifications in programming. It is noted that developing and using visual languages can have considerable impact on the development of nano-bio-info-cogno technologies (NBIC) as well as on the research in the field of cognitive management, artificial intelligence as modeling visual thinking and other research areas. We recommend further understanding how to use visual programming languages in social, philosophical and psychological aspects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) adopts and extends the concept of cloud computing to make mass Manufacturing Resources and Capabilities (MR/Cs) more widely integrated and accessible to users through the Internet. However, a single manufacturing cloud (MC) only has relatively limited scalability and elasticity. Using the aggregated MR/Cs from multiple MCs is a natural evolution. To address this requirement, we propose an integration framework for multiple MCs, so that MCs can collaboratively cope with peak user demands for MR/Cs. The key functional modules and the business model of the proposed framework are presented to guide future integration of multiple MCs. The enabling technologies, such as semantic web and ontologies, intelligent agents, service oriented architecture, and material handling and logistics technologies are also discussed. An application example is given, showing the feasibility and rationality of the proposed approach. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The implementation of cloud computing in tele-health has enabled enormous benefits of improving health-care services as well as active health approaches, such as Patient-Centered Telehealth (PCT). Applying cloud systems enables healthcare users to obtain medical information from multiple cloud-based platforms or sources. Various service deployments meet different customers' needs. As one of the popular information sharing manners on clouds, Online Self-Diagnosis (OSD) has been widely implemented for recommending medicines or treatment plans in the varied medical fields. However, there is a great risk for users when executing OSD since lack of professional pharmacological knowledge. This paper concentrates on this issue and proposes an ontology-based approach representing the medical knowledge for alarming potential risks. The proposed mechanism is named Secure Ontology-based Self-diagnosis (SOS) Model that is designed to generate knowledge of medical treatments or incompatibility of medicines to avoid improper behaviors of diagnoses. Based on the proposed model, our algorithm uses structure-level technique applying semantic schemas, which is Propositional Satisfiability Matching Algorithm (PSMA). Our experiment has proved the feasibility of our proposed mechanism. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Web Ontology Language (OWL) is used by domain experts to encode knowledge. OWL primarily only supports the subClassOf (is - A or inheritance) relation. Various other relations, such as partOf, are essential for representing information in various fields including all engineering disciplines. The current syntax of OWL does not support the declaration and usage of new custom relations. Workarounds to emulate custom relations do exist, but they add syntax burden to knowledge modelers and don't support accurate semantics for inference engines. This paper proposes minimal syntax extension to OWL for declaring custom relations with special attributes, and applying them in knowledge representation. Domain experts can apply custom relations intuitively and concisely as they do with the familiar built-in subClassOf relation. We present our additions to the OWL API for the declaration, application, and visualization of custom relations. We outline our revision and additions to the ontology editor Protégé so its users could visually declare, apply and remove custom relations according to our enriched OWL syntax. Work relating to our modification of the OWLViz plugin for custom relations visualization is also discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud technology can be used to support costeffective, scalable, and well-managed healthcare information systems. However, cloud computing, particularly multitenancy, introduces privacy and security issues related to personal health information (PHI). In this paper, we designed ontological models for healthcare workflow and multi-tenancy, and then applied HIPAA requirements on the models to generate HIPAA-compliant access control policies. We used Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to represent access control policies as rules, and we verified the rules with an OWL-DL reasoner. Additionally, we implemented HIPAA security rules through access control policies in a cloud-based simulated healthcare environment. More specifically, we investigated access control policy specification and enforcement for cloud based healthcare information systems using an open source cloud platform, OpenStack. The results manifest HIPAA compliance through authorization policies that are capable of addressing vulnerabilities of multi-tenancy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Two of the major concerns of researchers and clinicians performing neuroimaging experiments are managing the huge quantity and diversity of data and the ability to compare their experiments and the programs they develop with those of their peers. In this context, we introduce Shanoir, which uses a type of cloud computing known as software as a service to manage neuroimaging data used in the clinical neurosciences. Thanks to a formal model of medical imaging data (an ontology), Shanoir provides an open source neuroinformatics environment designed to structure, manage, archive, visualize, and share neuroimaging data with an emphasis on managing multi-institutional, collaborative research projects. This article covers how images are accessed through the Shanoir Data Management System and describes the data repositories that are hosted and managed by the Shanoir environment in different contexts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes a generalized cluster risk evaluation model by applying a data mining method to the cloud computing risk evaluation. The model maps data sets into a semantic space via singular value decomposition (SVD), uses a clustering algorithm to classify them and to extract the prototype vector of a particular category from clustering results, and assigns a definite weight to each category so as to set up an initial prototype vector model. The model is taken as the basis for risk evaluation of information system. After the data to be evaluated were mapped to the same semantic space, they are calculated with the prototype vector of each category, so as to obtain the similarity of the category, and the cumulative sum of the similarity with the weight of the corresponding category comes out. Finally, a mean value is calculated to obtain the risk value of the data to be evaluated, namely, the risk value of the occasion when the data is obtained. In this paper, the safety risk information is obtained from the operating system log and Web application server log of a virtual host; the Latent Semantic Analysis-based Generalized Cluster Classifier (LSA-GCC) is adopted and the MapReduce-based LSA-GCC and LSA-SAM parallel acceleration experiment is conducted. The experimental results show that in a cloud computing environment of large-scale parallel processing, the method used in this paper can identify the log events of a cloud computing system and conduct risk prompt rapidly. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Interoperability problems between cloud providers are one of the most serious issues of this new computing paradigm. A methodology is needed to systematically and effectively find and solve interoperability problems. For these reasons, a new methodology with detailed steps to find and solve interoperability problems is proposed here. This new methodology is focused and implemented on the platform as a service model, but it can be used in any of the three main models of cloud computing. The methodology uses an iterative approach, because platform as a service offers and their application programming interfaces evolve and change very often. The focus of the methodology is to use remote cloud application programming interfaces to solve interoperability problems on technical, storage and services levels, respectively. Finally, we show the application of the methodology to achieve service-level interoperability among different providers of platform as a service. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Globalization and cloud computing have allowed major strides forward in terms of communication possibilities, but it is also illuminating how many different resource options and formats exist access to which would dramatically increase the accuracy and reliability of choices made as a result of computational output. As a result, there is increasing need for methods resolving levels of data translations necessary for the effectiveness of distributed Linked Data platforms, especially in the context of the Building Information Modeling domain in which we conduct our work. The following research presents the current state of our Linked Data Platform for handling and processing Resilience and BIM data from existing and remotely located data stores and simulation models. This approach focuses on data interoperability and illustrates the functional interactions of a set of lightweight API endpoints that serve resources as requests are extensible with the HYDRA Core Vocabulary to increase data discoverability opportunities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ensuring privacy of Big Data managed on the cloud is critical to ensure consumer confidence. Cloud providers publish privacy policy documents outlining the steps they take to ensure data and consumer privacy. These documents are available as large text documents that require manual effort and time to track and manage. We have developed a semantically rich ontology to describe the privacy policy documents and built a database of several policy documents as instances of this ontology. We next extracted rules from these policy documents based on deontic logic which can be used to automate management of data privacy. In this paper we describe our ontology in detail along with the results of our analysis of privacy policies of prominent cloud services. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The number of software providers offering their applications as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to exploit the benefits of cloud computing is increasing. New challenges to the cloud services discovery are imposed due to the SaaS services unique characteristics such as various and dynamic service offerings and the lack of standard description language. In this study, we propose OntSaaS, an ontology-based system for SaaS publication and discovery. Ont SaaS standardizes the advertisement process, serves as a semantic-based catalogue for the service offerings and provides competent search capabilities for the user. The main building blocks of the proposed system are the unified SaaS ontology and a semantic business-oriented matchmaking technique that maps requests and offers of cloud SaaS services. The proposed request-service matchmaking algorithm merges semantic-based services metadata with ontology-based hierarchical matching. Prototypical implementation and evaluation of the system proved its performance enhancement in respect of the service utility and success rate. Results showed that the concept recommendation approach employed decreased the service registration process time. Moreover, the proposed matchmaking algorithm similarity results revealed the actual relevance of the offered services to the user requests. Finally, the proposed ontology-based expansion approach for the user request improved the user opportunity to find appropriate services to his requirements in case of discovery partial match. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, semantic web services are published and updated with growing demand for cloud computing. Since a single service is not capable of processing the increase of data and user's demand the improvement is necessary to match and rank semantic web service to achieve the user's goal. In the semantic web service framework, users' request is the input to the system and output is ranking of semantic web service. It has become a limitation to match between requests with the semantic web service description. This paper proposes a new framework for matching and ranking semantic web service based on OWL-S. The proposed new framework can match the keyword in each task and ranking service. This framework is done by using performance ontology-based indexing. The result is obtained and the performance of the services for multiple requests has been measured. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Distributed computer integrated manufacturing is increasingly adopting cloud computing, software-as-a-service (SaaS) and multi-agent systems as steps towards "design anywhere, build anywhere" strategy. In this scenario, foundation ontologies not only serve as common message exchange structure among distributed agents but also provide reasoning service to extract implicit knowledge from explicit information already stored in the knowledge base. Foundation ontologies, comprised of most general concepts of a domain, provide a common semantic structure to the domain-level ontologies, which capture details of multi-disciplinary manufacturing knowledge. In this paper, foundation ontology for manufacturing process planning is proposed and manufacturing process selection information of a sample prismatic design feature is modeled using the proposed foundation ontology, as a case study. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine digital preservation of e-government in Ghana under the research question: what are the current digital preservation strategies being deployed across the ministries and agencies in Ghana? Design/methodology/approach: Guided by a conceptual framework, underpinned by a quantitative approach, the paper uses the survey approach, to address the digital preservation strategies deployed across public sector organisations in Ghana. It underscores the link between the conceptual framework and the literature to analyse the various digital preservation strategies. Findings: Backup strategy, migration, metadata and trusted repositories were noted as the most widely implemented preservation strategies across the ministries and agencies. On the other hand, cloud computing, refreshing and emulation were the least implemented strategies used to address the digital preservation challenges. Research limitations/implications: The paper adds to the existing conceptual underpinnings that have dominated the debate about data management, archival storage, preservation strategies, challenges and best practices of digital preservation of e-government. Originality/value: This study draws its originality from the evidence of studies on digital preservation in Ghana as most studies have rather focussed on the preservation of documentary heritage, preservation and security of microfilms, preservation practices in the public records (Akussah, 2002; Ampofo, 2009; Festus, 2010). The emergence of this study addresses the knowledge gap in the preservation of digital records in a country where little attention has been accorded to digital preservation. The study also feeds into Ghana’s vision 2020 and the information communication technology policy document of the ministry of communication which aims at ensuring that Ghanaians have access to information and communication technology products and services. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is becoming more and more popular, many users choose to outsource their data to the cloud. The sensitive data need to be protected before outsourcing, and encryption is usually chosen to protect the data privacy, but it makes the data service such as search a very difficult work. Many searchable encryption schemes are proposed to allow users make effective search over encrypted data. But there is no tolerance of fuzzy and semantic keyword search in one scenario, which greatly affects the search usability. This weakness makes user’s searching experiences very low. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving fuzzy and semantic keyword search scheme over encrypted data in cloud computing. Fuzzy keyword search ability can allow users input search keyword with small typos, and semantic keyword search ability enable returns the matching documents when users’ search keyword has the semantic relation with the keywords in the documents. In our scheme, we extract the fuzzy and semantic keyword set using the dictionary and WordNet technique. We also prove that our scheme is privacy preserving through security analysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Neural networks proved extremely feasible for problems which are hard to solve by conventional computational algorithms due to excessive computational demand, as NP-hard problems, or even lack of a deterministic solution approach. In this paper we present a management framework for neural network objects based on ontology knowledge for the cloud-based neural network simulator N2Sky, which delivers neural network resources as a service on a world-wide basis. Core of this framework is the Neural Network Query Engine, N2Query, which allows users to specify their problem statements in form of natural language queries. It delivers a list of ranked N2Sky resources in return, providing solutions to these problems. The search algorithm applies a mapping process between a domain specific problem ontology and solution ontology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the explosive growth of digital data communications in synergistic operating networks and cloud computing service, hyperconnected manufacturing collaboration systems face the challenges of extracting, processing, and analyzing data from multiple distributed web sources. Although semantic web technologies provide the solution to web data interoperability by storing the semantic web standard in relational databases for processing and analyzing of web-accessible heterogeneous digital data, web data storage and retrieval via the predefined schema of relational / SQL databases has become increasingly inefficient with the advent of big data. In response to this problem, the Hadoop Ecosystem System is being adopted to reduce the complexity of moving data to and from the big data cloud platform. This paper proposes a novel approach in a set of the Hadoop tools for information integration and interoperability across hyperconnected manufacturing collaboration systems. In the Hadoop approach, data is "Extracted" from the web sources, "Loaded" into a set of the NoSQL Hadoop Database (HBase) tables, and then "Transformed" and integrated into the desired format model with Hive's schema-on-read. A case study was conducted to illustrate that the Hadoop Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) approach for the syntax and semantics web data integration could be adopted across the global smartphone value chain. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, the term knowledge graph has been used frequently in research and business, usually in close association with Semantic Web technologies, linked data, large-scale data analytics and cloud computing. Its popularity is clearly influenced by the introduction of Google's Knowledge Graph in 2012, and since then the term has been widely used without a definition. A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google's Knowledge Graph, although no official documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a definition that is free from ambiguity. We tackle this issue by discussing and defining the term knowledge graph, considering its history and diversity in interpretations and use. Our goal is to propose a definition of knowledge graphs that serves as basis for discussions on this topic and contributes to a common vision. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the pervasion of cloud computing, virtual enterprises (VEs) are anticipated to increasingly rely on ecosystems of highly distributed, task-oriented, and collaborative cloud services for their operations. In order to manage the complexity inherent in such ecosystems, VEs are expected to increasingly depend upon policies that regulate the deployment and delivery of these services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity inherent in cloud services hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable such policies. This calls for a policy validation mechanism that is able to automatically evaluate the correctness of these policies. This paper proposes such a validation mechanism, one which is underpinned by a generic representation of the knowledge that lurks behind policies and thus is orthogonal to any particular cloud service delivery platform. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Computing enabled a lot of vendors to introduce various services. The diversity of provided services resulted in interoperability and portability issues. This paper discusses how semantic web and semantic web services can support the hybrid cloud model. It uses semantic web to provide a dynamic integration of in-house resources with the public resources, i.e. hybrid cloud. Different ontologies are proposed to describe the different scenarios of using the third party resources, i.e. infrastructure resources, services and composite services. A new framework, ShClS, is presented for that purpose. While the majority of the other works in the hybrid clouds concentrate on optimizing the cost and/or the response time, this paper proposes the usage of the risk of using resources in addition to the cost considering the privacy requirements of the owner. It depends on the expected monetary value analysis, EMV, when making the decision of running the job execution request using one of the different available integration options. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) follows a set of guidelines (i.e. best practices) to create interoperable APIs over Cloud resources. In this paper, we identify a set of patterns that must be followed and anti-patterns that should be avoided to comply with the OCCI guidelines. To automatically detect (anti)patterns, we propose a Semantic-based approach, relying on SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) rules and in SQWRL (Semantic Query-Enhanced Web Rule Language) queries to describe the (anti)patterns symptoms. An evaluation, conducted on real world Cloud service APIs, shows the feasibility of the proposed approach by assessing their compliance to OCCI standard. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Service-orientation is increasingly adopted by application and service developers, leading to a plethora of services becoming increasingly available. To enable constructing applications from such services, respective service description and discovery must be supported by considering both functional and non-functional aspects as they play a significant role in the service management lifecycle. However, research in service discovery has mainly focused on one aspect and not both of them. As such, this paper investigates the issues involved in considering both functional and non-functional aspects in service discovery. In particular, it proposes different ways via which aspect-specific algorithms can be combined to generate a complete service discovery system. It also proposes a specific unified service discovery architecture. Finally, it evaluates the proposed algorithms’ performance to give valuable insights to the reader. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Service-orientation has revolutionized the way applications are constructed and provisioned. To this end, a proliferation of web services is being increasingly available. To exploit such services, an accurate service discovery process is required with a suitable performance focusing both on functional and quality of service (QoS) aspects. In fact, QoS is the main distinguishing factor for the plethora of functionally-equivalent services available in the internet. Accuracy in service discovery comes via exploiting formal techniques and ontologies in particular. Satisfactory performance levels can be reached via using smart methods that intelligently organise the service advertisement space. In this paper, we propose smart ontology-based QoS-aware service discovery algorithms that exploit ontology subsumption as a means of matching QoS requests and offers. These algorithms exploit a variety of methods to structure the service advertisement space. Based on the empirical evaluation conducted, our proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art in certain circumstances. To this end, ontology-based subsumption is indeed a promising technique to realise QoS-based service matchmaking. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In an attempt to tackle shortcomings of current approaches to collaborating on the development of structured data sets, we present a prototype platform that allows users to share and collaborate on the development of data structures via a web application, or by using language bindings or an API. Using techniques from the theory of persistent linked data structures, the resulting platform delivers automatically version-controlled map and graph abstract data types as a web service. The core of the system is provided by a Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT) which is made confluently persistent by path-copying. The system aims to make efficient use of storage, and to have consistent access and update times regardless of the version being accessed or modified. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Computing has several provisioning models, namely Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Software as a service (SaaS). However, cloud users (tenants) have limited or no control over the underlying network resources and services. Network as a Service (NaaS) is emerging as a novel model to bridge this gap. However, NaaS requires an approach capable of modeling the underlying network resources and capabilities in abstracted and vendor-independent form. In this paper we elaborate on SemNaaS, a Semantic Web based approach for supporting network management in NaaS systems. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt and improve the Network Markup Language (NML) ontology for describing NaaS infrastructures. Second, based on that ontology, we develop a network modeling system that is integrated with the existing OpenNaaS framework. Third, we demonstrate the benefits that Semantic Web adds to the Network as a Service paradigm by applying SemNaaS operations to a specific NaaS use case. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is a technology that allows companies and individuals to outsource their data and their applications. The aim is to take advantage from the power of storage and processing offered by such technology. However, in order to preserve data privacy, it is crucial that all data must be encrypted before being outsourced into the cloud. Moreover, authorized users should be able to recover their outsourced data. This process can be complicated due to the fact that data are encrypted. The traditional information retrieval systems only work over data in the clear. Therefore, dedicated information retrieval systems were developed to deal with the encrypted cloud data. Several kinds of search over cloud data have been proposed in the literature such as Boolean search, multi-keyword ranked search and fuzzy search. However, the semantic search is little addressed in the literature. In this paper, we propose an approach called SSE-S that take into account the semantic search in the cloud by using Wikipedia ontology to understand the meaning of documents and queries with maintaining the security and the privacy issues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Cloud computing provides access to a large scale of resources. Access control is the indispensable requirement for protecting cloud resource. A cloud service provider is responsible for enforcing access control and they normally rely upon conventional access control mechanisms. Methods: These access control policies, consider the access control primitives in separation which may lead to abuse of access control. These aforesaid problems motivated our research to center around the provision of access control by considering the association among the three access control primitives namely the user making access request, resource upon which access is requested and operation performed by the user on the resource. Hence Ontology Centric Access Control (OCAC) is being proposed in this paper. Findings: This OCAC circulates authorization rules among the primitives of access control say subject, object and action by reducing the various associations among the associations among the access control elements; it is observed that there is less chance for security violation. Ontology is used since it reduces the times of agreement while exchanging the authorization policies across the security domains. For reducing the number of statements and rules in policy base, subsumption property is used. This reduces the space and time complexity. Applications/Improvements: We are applying our work to protect bank data as banks are embracing clouds to store huge data by cutting their IT costs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Multiple stakeholders can capture and map knowledge in a flexible and efficient manner. The major contribution of the paper is the definition and development of an ontology for cloud computing requirements. The approach views each user requirement as a semantic intelligence task that maps and delivers it as cloud services. Requirements are modelled as tasks designed to meet specific requirements, problem domains that the requirements exist in, and problem-solving methods which are generic mechanisms to solve problems. A meta-ontology for cloud computing is developed and populated with ontology fragments on to which cloud computing requirements can be mapped. A critical analysis of the usage of ontologies in the requirements process is made and a case study is described that demonstrates the approach in a real-world application. The conclusion is that problem-solving ontologies provide a useful mechanism for the specification and reuse of requirements in the cloud computing environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A network architecture, based on increasing intelligence of computing nodes, is suggested for building the semantic grid. In its essence, distributed intelligent managed element (DIME) network architecture extends the conventional computational model of information processing networks, allowing improvement of the efficiency and resiliency of computational processes. This approach is based on organising the process dynamics under the supervision of intelligent agents. The DIME network architecture utilises the DIME computing model with non-von Neumann parallel implementation of a managed Turing machine cluster with a signalling network overlay and adds cognitive elements to evolve super-recursive information processing, for which it is proved that they improve efficiency and power of computational processes. In this paper, we model the DIME network architecture using grid automata. A grid automaton provides a universal model for computer, sensor, and many other networks. We introduce different types of grid automata and study constructive operations with grid automata, which are oriented at the network construction, generation and development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Enterprises are embracing cloud computing in order to reduce costs and increase agility in their everyday business operations. Nevertheless, due mainly to confidentiality, privacy and integrity concerns, many are still reluctant to migrate their sensitive data to the cloud. In this paper, firstly, we outline the construction of a suitable Context-aware Security Model, for enhancing security in cloud applications. Secondly, we outline the construction of an extensible and declarative formalism for representing policy-related knowledge, one which disentangles the definition of a policy from the code employed for enforcing it. Both of them will be employed for supporting innovative PaaS-enabled access control mechanisms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence of complex cloud services and the growing number of QoS metrics entail the need of automation to transform business requirements into QoS constraints. Furthermore, in the emergent context of Cloud Federations providers need to share knowledge to improve interoperability when negotiating SLA (Service Level Agreements). Intelligent software agents are capable of supporting activities related to SLA negotiation, as well as sharing knowledge into large-scale distributed environments. Since they are usually provided with different ontologies, understanding the meaning of the messages requires the availability of common, global ontologies among customers and providers. In order to deal with this issue, we discuss a multi-agent SLA negotiation protocol which does not need a common global agent ontology. The protocol takes into account different concerns related to the understanding of semantic and technical terms, and the knowledge about the agent abilities on semantic and technical terms are shared among the Cloud Federation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The economic cost is a decisive factor that influences the migration of an application to a cloud infrastructure. Once the migration has been decided, the cost of cloud resources that will be hired to run the application must be minimized considering the application and user constraints. In this paper, we propose a method to determine the cheapest combination of computing instances to execute bag-of tasks applications in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) infrastructure. The method considers the heterogeneity of the resources (types of computing instances, regions and availability zones, or purchasing and payment options) as well as the deadline and the input workload provided by the user. The paper also shows how the proposed method improves provisioning decisions previously adopted by the authors to execute a linked-data application. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - When an undesirable situation occurs in a hybrid cloud computing environment, vital issues arise when searching for IaaS cloud services that best-match to the user’s requirements. This includes the different descriptions/ naming of IaaS cloud services, i.e., CPU, memory, and others, adapted by different companies making it difficult and ambiguous to select the best-match cloud services. Initially, we considered utilizing ontology technology and typical clustering methods to narrow down the selection process. In this paper, we proposed an improved ontology clustering scheme and describe the methodology. Preliminary experiments shows promising results showing a fair gathering of related elements in the cluster and the speedup of processing depicting a viable resiliency support for hybrid cloud. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The characteristics of the Cloud Computing paradigm make it attractive to be used along with other paradigms like mobile and pervasive computing, smart cities, etc. There is a need to develop new platforms in order to take advantage of those converged infrastructures, and to abstract its high heterogeneities and complexities. The design and development of such robust and efficient platforms is challenging, because of the high heterogeneities, complexities and the wide range of features they are supposed to offer. In this paper, we define some fundamental requirements related to those converged paradigms and infrastructures, and by consequence the requirements for cloud-oriented platforms. We also develop an architectural model, based on a new concept, the semantically defined resource, which is the result of the need to simplify the definition of lightweight services and to introduce more semantics. We also present an example to illustrate how to design architectures basing on the new concept, and how the architectural model can be used concretely. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is providing a computing infrastructure to facilitate storage and processing of massive amounts of information (Big Data). Processing of massive datasets becomes more and more important since the data becoming available to us increase every day in volume, variety, speed of change and (potentially) quality. Processing these data becomes more and more difficult under traditional computing platforms since we need the ability to compute and scale at the same time.Under this context, for this work we describe the design and implementation of a responsive and user driven processing service. This is a geoprocessing service that operates on geospatial datasets and provides geostatistical interpolation (a specific variant called Kriging). This service is based on existing service implementation standards in the geospatial domain (namely WPS standard from OGC). Additionally our service can query and retrieve information that is integrated following the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative. This is a unique capability that allows the service to rely on data, besides the existing ones and the ones provided by the user, that can be retrieved from the integrated information space that is being built on the web. In this paper we present the design and implementation of the service on a Linked Data store and discuss capabilities, issues and future research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the proliferation of Cloud services and the huge number of Cloud offers currently available in the IT market, it can be difficult for customers to understand which one fits their need. Patterns, if correctly applied to the design and development of Cloud applications, can ease programmers’ burden and reduce errors and bugs in application implementation. In this paper we use a methodology, based on the semantic representation of Cloud patterns, Cloud services and applications, to support users in developing Cloud oriented software meeting their explicit requirements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Access Control is one of the essential and traditional security weapons of data protection. In open and complex environments such as the Internet or cloud computing, the decision to grant access to a resource must ensure a secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In recent years, many access control models and languages were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their specifications. In this paper we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies. Based on a semantic modeling approach, specifically formal ontology, we will try to incorporate data protection legislation requirements in policies specification and implementation. This aims to abstract the complexity of legal requirements expression and to facilitate their automation and enforcement at execution level. Indeed, at run time, the interoperability of diverse information and the reference to the text law are addressed in a novel manner. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Semantic annotations of web services are useful in service discovery only when it reflects accurate service. But the rate of defects in semantic annotations was found to be very high due to the need for human interaction and expertise. The purpose of this work is to verify the semantic annotation of web services. The verification is based on the conventional testing process. In this paper, emphasis is laid on automation of semantic annotations to increase the efficiency and accuracy to provide useful web service through which the required data can be reproduced according to the specification defined by the services. In particular, the study proposed a technique from software testing to address the problem of semantic annotation verification. A software testing has been well proven to be effective for verification of software program behavior according to its specifications. By using a test suite which consists of test cases with specific data values for feeding the execution, therefore the expected outputs are generated as per the specification. As specified by the test cases, the software is executed using the input values. In this way, there is a possibility to identify a defect due to the inconsistency between the output delivered and expected by a test case. The advantages of proposed model are: (1) ease of use when information, (2) automatic compliance to system requirements and specification, (3) improved accuracy, (4) use of ontology based partitioning, (5) efficient defect detection mechanisms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a framework, called the knowledge co-creation framework (KCF), for the heterogeneous multi-robot transfer learning method with utilization of cloud-computing resources. A multi-agent robot system (MARS) that utilizes reinforcement learning and transfer learning methods has recently been deployed in real-world situations. In MARS, autonomous agents obtain behavior autonomously through multi-agent reinforcement learning and the transfer learning method enables the reuse of the knowledge of other robots’ behavior, such as for cooperative behavior. These methods, however, have not been fully and systematically discussed. To address this, KCF leverages the transfer learning method and cloud-computing resources. In prior research, we developed a hierarchical transfer learning (HTL) method as the core technology of knowledge co-creation and investigated its effectiveness in a dynamic multi-agent environment. The HTL method hierarchically abstracts obtained knowledge by ontological methods. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of HTL with two types of ontology: action and state. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent research in Cloud Computing and Peer-to-Peer systems for Video-on-Demand (VoD) has focused on multimedia information retrieval, using cloud nodes as video streaming servers and peers as a way to distribute and share the video segments. A key challenge faced by these systems is providing an efficient way to retrieve the information segments descriptor, composed of its metadata and video segments, distributed among the cloud nodes and the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. In this paper, we propose a novel Cloud Computing and P2P hybrid architecture for multimedia information retrieval on VoD services that supports random seeking while providing scalability and efficiency. The architecture comprises Cloud and P2P layers. The Cloud layer is responsible for video segment metadata retrieval, using ontologies to improve the relevance of the retrieved information, and for distributing the metadata structures among cloud nodes. The P2P layer is responsible for finding peers that have the physical location of a segment. In this layer, we use trackers, which manage and collect the segments shared among other peers. We also use two Distributed Hash Tables, one to find these trackers and the other to store the information collected in case the tracker leaves the network and another peer needs to replace it. Unlike previous work, our architecture separates cloud nodes and peers responsibilities to manage the video metadata and its segments, respectively. Also, we show via simulations, the possibility of converting any peer to act as a tracker, while maintaining system scalability and performance, avoiding using centralized and powerful servers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, the number of surveillance video data has grown enormously since the popularity of the smart cities, which brings the difficulties to users for searching and analyzing the content of the videos. These video data are not limited to data anymore, which provide the effective information for criminal investigation systems, intrusion detection system, and many others. However, as the number of available cloud services increases, the problem of data discovery and selection arises. The semantic technology is an effective choice for enhancing the accurate of the data searching and analyzing process. In this paper, a semantic based cloud environment is proposed to facilitate the analyzing and searching process of surveillance video data. An architecture integrating ontology building, semantic annotation, and semantic search is proposed to leverage the semantic description of the video data to find them from concept-based level. A semantic intermediate layer which organizes the video data based on their semantic relations is given. Moreover, the proposed method is used in the intelligent transportation field, which shows the bright prospect of the proposed method in real applications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the advent of Cloud Computing, new opportunities for Business Process Outsourcing services have emerged. Business Process as a Service (BPaaS), a new cloud service model, has recently gained a great importance for outsourcing cloud-based business processes constructed for multi-tenancy. In such a multi-tenant environment, using configurable business process models enables the sharing of a reference process among different tenants that can be customized according to specific needs. With a large choice of configurable process modeling languages, different providers may deliver configurable processes with common functionalities but different representations which makes the process discovery and configuration a manual tedious task. This in turn creates cloud silos and vendors lock-in with non-reusable configurable BPaaS models. Therefore, with the aim of enabling the interoperability between multiple BPaaS providers, we propose in this paper a semantic framework for BPaaS configurable models. Taking advantage of Semantic Web technologies and data mining techniques, our framework allows for (1) an ontology-based high level abstract representation of BPaaS configurable models enriched with configuration guidelines and (2) an automated approach for extracting the configuration guidelines from existing process repositories. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we extend Signavio with our semantic framework and conduct experiments on a dataset from SAP reference model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing offers various computational resources via convenient on-demand service provision. Currently, heterogeneous services and cloud resources are usually utilized and managed through diverse service portals. This significantly limits the effectiveness and efficiency for tasks implementation. Fundamentally, it is due to the lack of adequate specifications for service concepts, operations and interfaces from diverse cloud service models and types. This paper proposes a service management operation semantic description framework for comprehensive cloud service operation specification. Relying on ontological modelling techniques, cloud service operations are specified via entity classification, attribute assertion, relationship assertion and annotation assertion. Further, the proposed framework benefits from operation reasoning application. It enables intelligent assistance for multiple operation preparation and remote execution tasks. Based on the approach, a cloud service operation ontology and a unified service access and manipulation system prototype are implemented. Extensive experiments are conducted over different cloud service providers and for distinct service models. Obtained results demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing practices by facilitating reliable and effective service access, manipulation and interaction tasks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Universia repository is composed of more than 15 million of educational resources. The lack of metadata describing these resources complicates their classification, search and recovery. To overcome this drawback, it was decided to semantically annotate the available educational resources using the ADEGA algorithm. For this objective, we selected the DBpedia, a cross-domain linked data composed of more than 3.77 million ‘things’ with 400 million ‘facts’, in order to make sure that the wide range of Universia topics are covered by the ontology. However, this kind of process is extremely expensive from a computational point of view: more than 1600 years of CPU time was estimated to achieve it. In this paper, parallel programming techniques and distributed computing paradigms are combined in order to achieve this semantic annotation in a reasonable time. The cornerstone of this proposal is a resource management and execution framework able to integrate heterogeneous computing resources at our disposal (grid, cluster and cloud resources). As a result, the problem was solved in less than 180 days, demonstrating that it is perfectly feasible to exploit the advantages of these computing models in the field of linked data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, people can easily use a smartphone to get wanted information and requested services. Hence, this study designs and proposes a Golf Swing Injury Detection and Evaluation open service platform with Ontology-oritened clustering case-based reasoning mechanism, which is called GoSIDE, based on Arduino and Open Service Gateway initative (OSGi). GoSIDE is a three-tier architecture, which is composed of Mobile Users, Application Servers and a Cloud-based Digital Convergence Server. A mobile user is with a smartphone and Kinect sensors to detect the user's Golf swing actions and to interact with iDTV. An application server is with Intelligent Golf Swing Posture Analysis Model (iGoSPAM) to check a user's Golf swing actions and to alter this user when he is with error actions. Cloud-based Digital Convergence Server is with Ontology-oriented Clustering Case-based Reasoning (CBR) for Quality of Experiences (OCC4QoE), which is designed to provide QoE services by QoE-based Ontology strategies, rules and events for this user. Furthermore, GoSIDE will automatically trigger OCC4QoE and deliver popular rules for a new user. Experiment results illustrate that GoSIDE can provide appropriate detections for Golfers. Finally, GoSIDE can be a reference model for researchers and engineers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - When sharing and storing healthcare data in a cloud environment, access control is a central issue for preserving data privacy as a patient's personal health data may be accessed without permission from many stakeholders. Specifically, dynamic authorization for the access of data is required because personal health data is stored in cloud storage via wearable devices. Therefore, we propose a dynamic access control model for preserving the privacy of personal healthcare data in a cloud environment. The proposed model considers context information for dynamic access. According to the proposed model, access control can be dynamically determined by changing the context information; this means that even for a subject with the same role in the cloud, access permission is defined differently depending on the context information and access condition. Furthermore, we experiment the ability of the proposed model to provide correct responses by representing a dynamic access decision with real-life personalized healthcare system scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Linked data describes a method of publishing structured data which it can be interlinked and become more effective through semantic queries. This enables data from different sources to be connected and queried. It builds upon standard web technologies such as HTTP, RDF and URIs. This method helps human readers to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. Regarding the importance of Linked data, the main aim of this article is visualizing scientific mapping of linked data to show its progress through one decade. The scientometric study employs hierarchical cluster analysis, strategic diagrams and network analysis to map and visualize the linked data landscape of the "Scopus" publications through the use of co-word analysis. The study quantifies and describes the thematic evolution of the field based on a total of 717 Scopus articles and their associated 19977 keywords published between 1970s and 2014. According to the results the thematic visualization and the clusters show most concepts concentrated around computer related terms, such as big data; cloud computing semantic data; semantic technologies; semantic web; artificial intelligence; computer programming; semantic search, etc. In addition, we found that in recent years after librarians and information scientists doing researches in linked data on the behalf of computer scientist the "user" studies became important. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of digital information in geological fields is becoming very important. Thus, informatization in geological surveys should not stagnate as a result of the level of data accumulation. The integration and sharing of distributed, multi-source, heterogeneous geological information is an open problem in geological domains. Applications and services use geological spatial data with many features, including being cross-region and cross-domain and requiring real-time updating. As a result of these features, desktop and web-based geographic information systems (GISs) experience difficulties in meeting the demand for geological spatial information. To facilitate the real-time sharing of data and services in distributed environments, a GIS platform that is open, integrative, reconfigurable, reusable and elastic would represent an indispensable tool. The purpose of this paper is to develop a geological cloud-computing platform for integrating and sharing geological information based on a cloud architecture. Thus, the geological cloud-computing platform defines geological ontology semantics; designs a standard geological information framework and a standard resource integration model; builds a peer-to-peer node management mechanism; achieves the description, organization, discovery, computing and integration of the distributed resources; and provides the distributed spatial meta service, the spatial information catalog service, the multi-mode geological data service and the spatial data interoperation service. The geological survey information cloud-computing platform has been implemented, and based on the platform, some geological data services and geological processing services were developed. Furthermore, an iron mine resource forecast and an evaluation service is introduced in this paper. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Computing has gained attention from both academic and industrial communities. Only a few efforts have been taken for supporting Cloud service discovery. This paper aims to provide a cloud service discovery mechanism that helps the cloud users to find the best service. It proposes multilayer architecture to discover the semantic services which are related to handle the emergency situations like earthquake, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and wild fires from cloud. The significance of this paper is that it uses an agent-based discovery system that consults ontology when retrieving information about Cloud services. The semantic service discovery used in this paper considers the functional properties and non functional properties of semantic web services. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Today Cloud Computing has gained its place in almost every area of technology through its great features like on demand self service, elasticity and resource pooling. Besides these features, the cloud computing doesn’t provide a unique semantic ground like that of semantic web. To overcome these shortages of cloud and to provide an environment that could enable searching of service and resource automatically, ontology could be used. Ontology can enhance dynamic discovery of services across various cloud computing environments, could provide an intelligent framework for Software as a service and many more. This paper makes a clear survey on the use of ontology in various areas of cloud computing like maintaining Resource Catalogues, managing SAAS infrastructure, security etc.,. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite its attractive benefits, cloud adoption is challenged by some criteria of security and privacy. Access Control is one of the traditional and essential security tools of data protection. The decision to grant access to a resource must ensure secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In particular, the challenge is more important with public clouds as many governing authorities could be involved in one cloud scenario. This implies a difficulty to work out which regulation should be applicable in case of conflict. In recent years, many access control models were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their security policies specification and enforcement. In this paper, we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies for the context of public cloud. Throughout the use of ontology tools, we propose an approach for checking privacy enforcement with access control conditions. We also suggest the use of privacy safeguards notification where the threat to privacy protection is related to the secondary usage of personal data more than just the data access itself. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have been playing a dramatically important role in tele-health domains. One of the major benefits of using EHR systems is assisting physicians to gain patients' healthcare information and shorten the process of the medical decision making. However, physicians' inputs still have a great impact on making decisions that cannot be checked by EHR systems. This consequence can be influenced by human behaviors or physicians' knowledge structures. An efficient approach of alerting to the unusual decisions is an urgent requirement for current EHR systems. This paper proposes a schema using ontology in big data to generate an alerting mechanism to assist physicians to make a proper medical diagnosis. The proposed model is Ontology-based EHR Error Prevention Model (OEHR-EPM), which is implemented by a proposed algorithm, Error Prevention Adjustment Algorithm (EPAA). The ontological approach uses Protege to represent the knowledge-based ontology. The proposed schema has been examined by our experiments and the experimental results show that our schema has a higher-level accuracy rate and acceptable operating time performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the open issues in cloud computing is service discovery. Another issue, which has received less attention by practitioners in the cloud computing industry, is service composition based on formal methods, particularly those based on automata and formal languages. In recent years, semantic techniques and cloud ontology have been used to improve the process of finding similar services in the cloud environment. Cloudle, which is the most recent agent-based and semantic-supported search engine in cloud systems, exploits such techniques. Though many models and architectures have been proposed to develop Cloudle, none of them used formal methods for composing services. In this paper, behavior composition, as a formal approach and a sound and complete controller synthesis technique, is adapted to provide a formal approach for resource matching and service composition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past few years, cloud computing has been more and more attractive as a new computing paradigm due to high flexibility for provisioning on-demand computing resources that are used as services through the Internet. In cloud computing, the unique characteristics in cloud services such as dynamic and diverse services offered at different levels, together with the lack of standardized description languages pose significant challenges for effective cloud service discovery. In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service categories to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching in real environments. Our approach has the capability to automatically identify and categorize cloud services by detecting cloud service concepts from cloud service sources. Initially, we focus on building the cloud service ontology by using NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology). Then, we utilize our cloud service categorization method to investigate cloud service ontology's concepts in a real-world cloud services dataset which contains the metadata of 5,883 real cloud services. After that, we generate cloud service clusters by using cosine similarity to build the cloud service categorization. Our cloud service categorization is helpful in determining whether a given web source is a cloud service. Furthermore, the new web resource which has been categorized as a cloud service can be used to boost knowledge of cloud service categorization cumulatively. The proposed approach is validated by using real-world cloud services available on the World Wide Web and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in cloud service discovery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present the SPORANGIUM platform that deploys sporadic social networks (SSNs) among people who happen to be in a common place, by establishing ad-hoc connections over their respective mobile devices. The idea is to boost interactions among strangers who might share common interests in places like museums, theatres and stadiums, taking care of multiple concurrent flows of information and enabling added-value services to efficiently manage those contents. This paper describes the simulator we have developed to validate the SSN concept in one of the application scenarios of SPORANGIUM, dealing with tourism information on behalf of the participants in a bus tour. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The analysis and decision scenarios, which are more complex in many domains, request more unstructured data to be reorganized with the structured data for analyzing. An architecture is proposed in this paper for data reconstruction to support OLAP analysis based on the knowledge graph and XML data warehouse technologies. In this architecture, the data cubes can be built with the data of two kinds of knowledge graphs, and the data populating of the cubes is on the basis of the correlation of the entities in knowledge graphs. Under the consideration of utilizing both information of the ontology concepts and their entities, a modified module in the architecture is also proposed for good concept selection to extract the cube dimension hierarchies. The evolution results prove the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed architecture and modified module. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is a new service-oriented networked manufacturing paradigm inspired by cloud computing. It provides high-efficiency and intelligent manufacturing services by organizing isolated manufacturing resources in a collaborative manner. Since the proposition of this concept in 2010, relevant research has mainly focused on theoretical frameworks of the CMfg system. However, actual applications of the machining service, which is a key part in the CMfg service platform, are hardly ever studied. In order to explore a feasible machining service mode, prime granularities of machining services are analyzed based on the current state of the manufacturing industry. Then a novel part manufacturing service combined with working procedure manufacturing service (PMS + WPMS) prime collaboration mode is proposed, followed by research of machining resource integration methods. To facilitate prospective implementations, information models of machining services are constructed using Web ontology language (OWL). The prime collaboration mode is expanded to a complete CMfg machining service platform. Furthermore, a working procedure priority-based algorithm (WPPBA) is designed for resource selection in CMfg. Finally, simulation experiments based on actual manufacturing data are conducted, in which the test results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed service mode and the effectiveness of WPPBA compared with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This research provides essential guidance for CMfg applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ambient assisted living (AAL) environments are augmented with sensing and communication technologies to support elderly people with personalized, adaptive and anticipatory requirements. A plethora of heterogeneous devices and services appear and disappear, which expose different behavior with the changing contexts in these environments. Therefore, a service matchmaking mechanism that attempts to identify relevant services in order to fulfill the user needs, has to deal with the heterogeneity of devices and services along with their dynamic behavior. Existing service specifications, such as semantic web services, are often used to abstract the environment’s functionalities and the user tasks without incorporating context-aware properties, which makes them unsuitable for service matchmaking in pervasive and ambient environment. To deal with these issues, we introduce a contExt Aware web Service dEscription Language (wEASEL) that is an abstract service model to represent services and user tasks in AAL environments. Also, we present a set of wEASEL-based service matching algorithms and evaluate them for their suitability. The proposed service matchmaking mechanism can incorporate services that are available in local AAL environment as well as in the cloud computing marketplace. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Scientists gain benefits from scalable resource provisioning on-demand, and various computing environments by using cloud computing resources for their applications. However, many cloud computing providers offer their cloud resources according to their own rules. The descriptions of various cloud resources also differ for each vendor. Subsequently, it becomes difficult to find suitable cloud resources given the characteristics of an application. Scientists therefore, select resources used in previous experiments or best performance resources without considering the characteristics of their applications. There is the need to standardize notations to support simple selection of cloud resources without the constraints of providers. Intercloud can use cloud resources without considering cloud providers in hybrid cloud environments. Intercloud project has been studied for interoperability and creates mOSAIC ontology to conceptualize various resources. However, the mOSAIC ontology attributes are limited when considering characteristics of an application. We propose a semantic engine to provide semantic cloud resource services in intercloud environment. We define a rule of categorized resource description with reference to mOSAIC ontology attributes which includes added factors needed to represent application characteristics. We also develop a semantic engine which can choose semantically similar cloud resources using statistical analysis while considering the characteristics of an application. The semantic engine can also classify resources dynamically according to application specifications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the explosive growth of Web services in Internet and cloud computing platform, it's difficult for researchers to identify, select, combine, and verify the Web service and its portfolio. The above scene motivates a new area of knowledge representation and services computing, which provide semantic browsing service for users in the type of associated knowledge flow. Associated knowledge flow will also provide fundamental principle for related services fields such as e-Learning, e-Science, video data management, Web searching which can help learners, readers, reviewers to observe, understand and recognize a given document more deeply. The overall idea of engineering design is given, SCAToOWL algorithm which used to converted SCA component and composite into CPSWS is proposed in the paper.

AB  - Summary Cloud federation can be described through the concept of collaboration, where each organization has its own cloud(s) that deals with a different and independent domain but needs to work together with other organizations in order to fulfill a specific shared objective. According to this perspective, the federation is a collection of interacting clouds that collaborate with one another through the instantiation and management of shared subsets of resources (computation and storage resources as well as sensors and actuators). This idea could be profitably used in those scenarios in which different organizations have to share several resources (e.g., emergency response or disaster management scenario). On the other hand, when different independent organizations share their resources, several issues arise. One of them is related to interoperability problems. As a consequence, this work also introduces a framework for an ontology-based resource life cycle management and provisioning in a federated cloud infrastructure. Therefore, The main contributions of this work consists of redesigning a cloud infrastructure architecture from the ground up, leveraging Semantic Web and Semantic Web Service Technologies, and natively supporting a federated provisioning of any kind of resource. This paper exploits, as a motivating scenario, a flood emergency response system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the pervasion of cloud computing, enterprises increasingly rely on ecosystems of variably-sourced, task-oriented, modular, cloud services for their daily operations. In order to effectively manage the complexity inherent in such ecosystems, enterprises are anticipated to depend upon brokerage mechanisms for performing policy-based governance and for selecting optimal services. Such mechanisms crucially depend upon the existence of a generic, uniform, and platform-independent representation of services, service-delivery policies, and consumer preferences. In this paper we describe an ontology-based approach to such a representation and demonstrate its applicability through a realistic case study. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To provide cloud services as a utility there must be a mechanism for comprehensively and precisely specifying cloud service agreements to reduce differences in service perception between customers and suppliers. This paper proposes a description logic driven approach to specifying cloud service agreements as ontology, which allows agreement and negotiation between the parties in the service agreement. A unique contribution is provided by modelling of cloud service agreements as ontology which is precise and comprehensive. Future work sees the approach expanded to include a greater number of cloud service agreement artifacts and a service agreement specification for a financial calculation service. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As Cloud Computing evolves, both customers and Cloud Service Providers are starting to require Intercloud scenarios where different clouds have to interact each other. Although there are some initial proposals to manage the Intercloud, there are still few approaches dealing with the associated new security and trust challenges in such a federated environment. To fill this gap, this paper presents SOFIC (Security Ontology For the InterCloud) aimed to formally describe the security aspects that are subject to be modeled in an Intercloud security assessment. SOFIC is based on standards and has been tailored extensible to cope with the security requirements of different Intercloud scenarios. The paper also shows in which way the ontology is used as input for a Trust and Security Decision Support System, in order to assist in the Intercloud security decision making process, quantifying security expectations and trustworthiness about Cloud Service Providers. The implementation, experiments and performance evaluation show the feasibility of the proposed ontology and system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Virtual screening is an indispensable tool to cope with the massive amount of data being tossed by the high throughput omics technologies. With the objective of enhancing the automation capability of virtual screening process a robust portal termed MegaMiner has been built using the cloud computing platform wherein the user submits a text query and directly accesses the proposed lead molecules along with their drug-like, lead-like and docking scores. Textual chemical structural data representation is fraught with ambiguity in the absence of a global identifier. We have used a combination of statistical models, chemical dictionary and regular expression for building a disease specific dictionary. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, a case study on malaria has been carried out in the present work. MegaMiner offered superior results compared to other text mining search engines, as established by F score analysis. A single query term 'malaria' in the portlet led to retrieval of related PubMed records, protein classes, drug classes and 8000 scaffolds which were internally processed and filtered to suggest new molecules as potential anti-malarials. The results obtained were validated by docking the virtual molecules into relevant protein targets. It is hoped that MegaMiner will serve as an indispensable tool for not only identifying hidden relationships between various biological and chemical entities but also for building better corpus and ontologies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Computing paradigm motivates researchers from both industry and academia with lot of research issues. Right from small and medium sized businesses and large scale businesses and even a single individual start utilizing cloud for their demands in terms of storage, software as well as infrastructure elastically and pay on use basis. But this transition to the cloud poses many security issues. One predominant issue is data security breach at many levels. Traditional cryptographic techniques and access control models like Mandatory, Discretionary and Role Based Access Control models are ill-suited for addressing multifarious security breaches in the cloud. This paper proposes dynamic access control for securing data in the cloud. This approach considers the interrelationship between the requestor, data being requested and action to be performed on that data. We also consider the context of the user for granting access control dynamically. In this paper, we enlighten the framework, its components and furthermore present an initial implementation of our model and some of the results of the same. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper highlights concept of rough Set theory and focus on its active participation in various technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data mining, expert system etc. we focus particularly on exploitation of rough set theory image retrieval with hybridization approach. We start with fundamental of rough set theory, its recent development, application, trends, impact on recent technology like cloud computing. In simple term, RS theory work or analysis on the basis of information associated with objects or events. Rough set theory is promising theory that work on intelligent analysis of imperfect data and produce meaningful information related to data according to requirement of application. Other theories like Bayesian inference or Fuzzy set theory are complementary theory that work parallel with Rough set theory on rough data or imperfect data, which is important and basic processing step of many application like search engine, data mining, web mining etc. In image retrieval, rough set theory play important role in classification, clustering, feature selection, feature extraction, rule learning etc. Our interest is to study its various combinational hybridized methods used in image retrieval to address semantic gap. We are proposed content based image retrieval framework with rough set theory for addressing semantic gap by using semantic classifier with semantics decision rule based on image information system. This framework also improves precision, recall and accuracy of image retrieval. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud services are becoming an essential part of many organizations. Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes a cloud-based platform, called RP-SMARF, for supporting research collaboration in the area of smart facilities management. More precisely, the proposed system delivers sophisticated domain-specific services to users by linking together disparate privately-owned elements such as data repositories, specialized hardware resources and specialized software applications into a unified framework. This allows research collaborators within a knowledge domain to easily run complex applications developed by researchers within the domain on complex datasets. Both batch-type processing as well as interactive application access are supported by the platform. The processing of live data streams generated in one site by an application residing in another site can also be performed. An authorization framework allows element owners to precisely control which users can access various elements. RP-SMARF unifies geographically dispersed heterogeneous resources for research collaborators. This simplifies making software created by researchers more usable by other researchers thereby making many researchers more productive. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The cloud lock-in problem is commonly addressed by three strategies: (i) use of intermediate layer between cloud services consumers and providers, (ii) use of standardized interfaces to access cloud services, or (iii) use of models with open specifications. This paper evaluated these strategies and concluded that despite the advances they introduced, none of them actually solves the cloud lock-in problem. To address this issue, this paper proposes the use of Semantic Web concepts to avoid cloud lock-in. The strategy consists of using RDF models to specify the features of a cloud service, which are managed by SPARQL queries. The contribution of this paper is fourfold: (i) to evaluate three multi-cloud solutions for the cloud lock-in problem in the context of three cloud platforms, (ii) to propose a strategy using RDF and SPARQL for managing cloud resources, (iii) to present the Cloud Query Manager (CQM), an SPARQL server that implements the proposal, and (vi) to compare three multi-cloud solutions with CQM in terms of response time and the effectiveness in the resolution of the cloud lock-in problem. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the contemporary cloud computing environment, the various cloud providers adopt different architectures for their systems and usually these are not compatible. The scalable exchange of information about these heterogeneous resources is often not addressed; still this represents an interesting challenge, since different Cloud systems and vendors have different ways to describe and invoke their services, to specify and communicate requirements. Hence a way to provide a common access to Cloud services and to discover and use required services in Cloud federations is highly desirable. The IEEE P2302 Intercloud approach is to define a scalable architecture and to adopt the OMN (Open-Multinet) ontology for supporting its operation. Our work specifically describes the inner workings of the Intercloud system in terms of the Intercloud Federation Application Programmers Interface (API), which are in turn based on the semantic definition of resources, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and Bearer Network Provisioning Metadata. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increasing adoption of Cloud Computing, Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) has recently emerged as the delivery of business process outsourcing services that are sourced from the cloud and constructed for multitenancy. BPaaS providers may look for available business processes from other cloud providers to improve their processes. However, today's BPaaS solutions lack an explicit and formal semantics which prevent an easy and dynamic interoperability between different cloud providers. In this paper, we propose firstly to semantically populate a shared knowledge base of process models deployed by BPaaS providers. Therefore, using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve similar process fragments that can be used to design new process variants. We also performed experiments on large public datasets and experimental results show that our approach is feasible and efficient. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of Cloud Computing drives the change of value creation towards services and creates a new networked economic structure for challenging organizations to adapt their existing business models. Despite agreement on that the transformation of business model is importance to an organization's success, the evolution of business model enabled by Cloud is still fuzzy and vague within many research fields including both Management Strategy Theory and Information Systems. This paper, following a review of existing works and a series of case studies from several typical industries, employs a deductive reasoning method to investigate the influence of cloud computing on business model evolution and presents a specific service-centric business model. First, the evolution of business model in cloud environment is developed. Second, by analyzing business model innovations on business model nine building blocks in cloud environment, the element of service-centric business model is defined. Then, an ontological framework which includes value, service, and business model dimension for service-centric innovative business model is proposed. Finally, several industrial cases validate that this paper provides a comprehensive framework of organization's business model which can properly reveals an organization's complex nature of business logic and operation management in cloud environment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Software as a Service (SaaS) has recently emerged as one of the most popular service delivery models in cloud computing. The number of SaaS services and their users is continuously increasing and new SaaS service providers emerge on a regular basis. As users are exposed to a wide range of SaaS services, they may soon become more demanding when receiving/consuming such services. Similar to the web and/or mobile applications, personalization can play a critical role in modern SaaS-based cloud services. This paper introduces a fully designed, cloud-enabled personalization framework to facilitate the collection of preferences and the delivery of corresponding SaaS services. The approach we adapt in the design and development of the proposed framework is to synthesize various models and techniques in a novel way. The objective is to provide an integrated and structured environment wherein SaaS services can be provisioned with enhanced personalization quality and performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As the use of services available on the Web is becoming mainstream, contracts and legal aspects of the relationship between providers and consumers need to be formalized. However, current proposals to model service level agreements are mostly focused on technical aspects, do not explicitly provide semantics to agreement terms, and do not follow Web principles. These limitations prevent take-up, automatic processing, and effective sharing of agreements. Linked USDL Agreement is a Linked Data based semantic model to describe and share service agreements that extends Linked USDL, which offers a family of languages to describe various technical and business aspects of services. We followed a use case driven approach, evaluating the applicability of our proposal in a cloud computing scenario, and comparing its expressiveness with existing models. Finally, we show a concrete tool that helps to model and check the validity of agreements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The volume of RDF data increases dramatically within recent years, while cloud computing platforms like Hadoop are supposed to be a good choice for processing queries over huge data sets for their wonderful scalability. Previous work on evaluating SPARQL queries with Hadoop mainly focus on reducing the number of joins through careful split of HDFS files and algorithms for generating Map/Reduce jobs. However, the way of partitioning RDF data could also affect system performance. Specifically, a good partitioning solution would greatly reduce or even totally avoid cross-node joins, and significantly cut down the cost in query evaluation. Based on HadoopDB, this work processes SPARQL queries in a hybrid architecture, where Map/Reduce takes charge of the computing tasks, and RDF query engines like RDF-3X store the data and execute join operations. According to the analysis of query workloads, this work proposes a novel algorithm for automatically partitioning RDF data and an approximate solution to physically place the partitions in order to reduce data redundancy. It also discusses how to make a good trade-off between query evaluation efficiency and data redundancy. All of these proposed approaches have been evaluated by extensive experiments over large RDF data sets. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emerging trends towards mobility and big data analysis strongly contribute to the success of cloud computing. Despite the numerous advantages cloud computing still has not reached its full potential due to the privacy and security concerns of today's cloud service users. In order to improve trust on clouds, in this paper we propose a cloud ontology which supports assurance and security initiatives. Finally, we show how we implemented the introduced ontology using the widely used Protégé tool. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Some time passed since the first definitions of Cloud architectures. During the years Cloud systems became more and more complex. The main idea is that all Cloud components offer their functions as a service. For this reason Cloud systems inherits many features from old Web Services and Service Oriented architectures. At the moment, the need for composition and automation of Cloud services is a hot research field. Orchestration is one of the topics that researchers are investigating. Unlike web services, it is not clear what orchestration means in Cloud Systems. It usually addresses automation, but no clear definitions and languages have been provided. Another hot topic regarding composition of cloud services is the definition of design, architectural and communication Patterns for solving well known and common problems. In this work we will show how Orchestration and some Patterns are tightly coupled. We will describe a methodology for definition of orchestrated workflows which exploits some common Cloud Design Patterns in order to verify composition soundness. In addition we will show how this methodology can be used to verify some requirements on the composed Cloud services. The whole methodology is based both on formal semantics definition of an Orchestration language, and on the use of Ontologies for the description of Cloud services interactions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the development of services computing and cloud computing, number of Web services has increased rapidly, and it becomes quite popular for developers to combine different Web services to build innovative Mash up applications. How to quickly locate desired Web service for developers, however, is still a challenging problem that needs to be addressed. Most existing related work employed keyword-based method to search services and focused on matching users' queries with semantic or syntactic Web service description. They seldom took advantage of relationships between services to improve the performance of service searching. This paper presents a correlation search method by making use of several relationships between Web services, to recommend a user with services that are similar, composable or potentially composable to a target service. One important advantage of this method is that it can guide users to find desired services promptly, and thus improves efficiency of the service discovery process. To mine the different relationships between services, several efficient algorithms are presented. Case studies and experiments show, the above correlation search method not only can recommend Web services to users that are relevant to the users' interest, but also can predict composable relationships between services with high performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring is widely applied in problem diagnosis, fault localization, and system maintenance. And since the cloud infrastructure is complex, the applications on the cloud are therefore complex, which makes monitoring in cloud more difficult. Rich monitors that contain composite and heterogeneous probes are often used in service-oriented system monitoring. These rich monitors often involve multiple entities, and the interpretation may require expert opinions from multiple domains. This paper proposes a knowledge-based collaborative monitoring approach to find out minimal cost monitor deployment in a cloud environment. The approach contains two main phases. In the knowledge acquisition phase, three acquisition tables, monitor-probe relationship matrix, cost of monitoring, and probe-problem dependence matrix, are generated according to diagnosis ontology and monitor ontology acquired from domain experts. And then based upon the three acquisition tables and three consensus building strategies, we formulate the problem of optimizing the cost of monitoring as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, which is NP-Complete. In the monitor deployment phase, the proposed algorithm applies two heuristic rules to address the problem. Three experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results from the experiments show that our approach is effective and produce quality approximate solutions in monitor deployment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: Most specialized users (scientists) that use bioinformatics applications do not have suitable training on software development. Software Product Line (SPL) employs the concept of reuse considering that it is defined as a set of systems that are developed from a common set of base artifacts. In some contexts, such as in bioinformatics applications, it is advantageous to develop a collection of related software products, using SPL approach. If software products are similar enough, there is the possibility of predicting their commonalities, differences and then reuse these common features to support the development of new applications in the bioinformatics area. Objectives: This paper presents the PL-Science approach which considers the context of SPL and ontology in order to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, and to specify a workflow that encompasses bioinformatics applications of a given experiment. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to enable the use of Software Product Line in biological domains. Method: In the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Line (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Line due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and using this abstract workflow model the products (scientific applications/algorithms) are instantiated. Results: Through the use of ontology as a knowledge representation model, we can provide domain restrictions as well as add semantic aspects in order to facilitate the selection and organization of bioinformatics workflows in a Scientific Software Product Line. The use of ontologies enables not only the expression of formal restrictions but also the inferences on these restrictions, considering that a scientific domain needs a formal specification. Conclusions: This paper presents the development of the PL-Science approach, encompassing a methodology and an infrastructure, and also presents an approach evaluation. This evaluation presents case studies in bioinformatics, which were conducted in two renowned research institutions in Brazil. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the last 10 years, virtualization has become a widespread technique in cloud computing; however, few of the access control models have ever addressed the security issue of multi-domain and virtualized network management; this paper enhanced the classic role-based access control model through two concepts: domain and virtual machine. We defined a new model named VRBAC in which authorized users can migrate or copy virtual machines from one domain to another without causing a conflict. Domain users or groups are allowed to share permissions of not only resources like shared files but also virtual machines with others either from the same or a different domain. Three kinds of VRBAC policy conflicts are defined in forms of ontologies, which provide extra access to description logic reasoning and facilitate the policy conflict detection. The experimental results based on Microsoft Active Directory and VMware vSphere suggest that all policy conflicts can be detected effectively and efficiently. Moreover, the generated reports can provide conflict details such as conflict types, positions, and causes, which will serve as guidance for further resolution of the improper authorizations and access violations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Following the crisis in 2008, different industrial sectors has faced growing numbers of laws and regulations globally. The number and complexity of these regulations is creating significant issues for governance, risk and compliance management especially for heavily-regulated sectors, such as the financial industry. This paper proposes a semantically-enabled compliance management framework that backs up the entire business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design-time verification, runtime and offline monitoring and analysis. In the heart of the framework is an integrated semantic repository incorporating domain, business and regulatory knowledge, at different levels of abstraction, which provides a shared conceptualization of the interrelated compliance and business specifics. Furthermore, given the technological revolution caused by cloud computing, we draw our vision on providing compliance-related ontologies as a service (COaaS) on the cloud. As an initial validation step, we have considered the financial sector with an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) case study and applied our semantic-based approach on. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing enables the organizations to outsource their information and data by providing a service model known as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). In a public cloud, the cloud service provider manages the infrastructure and it is situated in the provider's control. The documents are encrypted before outsourcing in order to protect the privacy of sensitive data. When the number of encrypted documents is exponentially increased, the search service and retrieval, becomes critical. The process of retrieving files consisting of queried keyword leads to unnecessary network traffic. In this paper, a secure scheme with multi key word search is proposed for encrypted cloud data. A searchable index is generated for the data that has to be outsourced to the cloud. Encryption of data is performed using Association Based Cryptography (ADC). The encrypted data is wrapped with index and then outsourced. The searched result is ranked by the cloud, server according to Robust Searchable Symmetric Encryption (R.SSE) ranking criteria in order to enhance the document retrieval accuracy. This approach provides high security by using ADC. The experimental results show that the method provides efficient integrity verification for the transferred data and achieves minimum overhead for both, communication and computation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud businesses need comprehensive visibility on hardware and software components, their utilization and their configuration. In addition, they need to integrate such information with their asset management systems and publicly available information such as hardware specifications. In this paper, we present an approach for cloud management and monitoring based on a semantic layer that unifies different interfaces and representations, and makes all relevant information accessible from a single point. We show a proof-of-concept based on OpenStack and Linked Data technologies and evaluate it in terms of overhead, query execution times, and effectiveness in the data gathering phase. Our findings indicate that a semantics-based approach is indeed feasible and advantageous for providing uniform access across different cloud environments and levels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advances in the field of cloud computing and networking have led to rapid development and market growth in areas such as online retail, gaming and healthcare. In the field of advanced manufacturing however, the impact has been significantly lesser than expected due to limitations in cloud platforms for fostering community engagement. To address this problem, we study a new cloud-based architecture that provides Platform-asa-Service (PaaS) management capabilities to the manufacturing community for delivering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) 'Apps' to their customers. Our architecture aims at supporting an 'App Marketplace' that thrives on agile development, organic collaboration and scalable sales of next generation manufacturing Apps requiring high-performance simulation and modeling. Towards realizing the vision of the above architecture, our paper involves investigation and implementation of an Ontology Service that interoperates with other common web services related to resource brokering and accounting. Our Ontology Service uses principles of mapping and merging to translate a manufacturing App's collaboration requirements to suitable resource specifications on public cloud platforms. Integrated resultant ontology can be queried to provision the required resource parameters such as amount of memory/storage, number of processing units, and network protocol configurations needed for deployment of an App. We validate the effectiveness of our Ontology Service using the Protégé framework in a pilot testbed of a real-world 'WheelSim' App in the NSF GENI Cloud platform. Our ontology integration results show benefits to an App developer in terms of: optimal user experience, lower design time and lower cost/simulation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a new notion of Ontology as a Service, in which the ontology tailoring process serves as a service in the cloud. To illustrate Ontology as a Service, we propose sub-ontology extraction and extension, whereby a sub-ontology is extracted from the main ontology and is then extended to cover new concepts and relationships. We use a maximum extraction method to facilitate this. Unified Medical Language System meta-thesaurus ontology is used as a walk-through case study to illustrate our proposed methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The demand of software as a service (SaaS)-based services delivering computing resources as on-demand software is on the rise in the IT industry. However, one of the drawbacks of the existing SaaS services is that they offer limited or no personalization of the services provided according to the users profile. Personalization as mentioned in the literature has been a key driver in the adoption and usage of various applications and in providing better service experience to the users. However, overwhelming majority of such personalized services rely extensively on the server side, without embracing fast-developing client-side technologies. In SaaS-based cloud services, utilizing this technology is necessary considering their limited processing specifications. Approaches have been proposed in the literature that focus on cloud-based personalization using client-side technologies but none of them actually address all the different components that are required for a scalable and holistic personalization framework for SaaS-based cloud services. In this paper, we address this drawback by proposing a user-focussed personalization framework. Our proposed framework takes advantage of powerful client side browsers to reduce server overheads, ameliorate performance, establish high intelligence and enrich data processing. To validate and demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we build a prototype model and compare its performance against existing approaches using different metrics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Low latency is the key requirement for cloud based web services particularly when there are heavy processes like inference from large knowledge-base are running and multiple simulataneous requests need to be entertained. This paper proposes Autonomous Decentralized L3 cache driver based URL filtering system, that uses two knowledge bases and proposal of L3 cache, to achieve low latency with high accuracy. The system creates ontology TDB files in way that most used relationships in ontology are in separate files. Thus the system caches the most frequently used relations of the ontology to minimize the time required by the inference engine of the text categorizer. Evaluation shows L3 cache achieved significant performance improvement in terms of processing time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is the fastest growing, popular and most widely used technology in the current web. Interoperability is one of the major issues found in cloud environments where it is not an easy go for the cloud consumers to have a direct interaction with the cloud providers in order to request for a service. The semantic web technology is the most powerful growing technology to the current web which allows adding semantic metadata to the cloud services. Addition of Semantic web technologies to the cloud platforms provides scalable and efficient results to the consumers. This paper presents a semantic interoperability model which provides an improved interaction between the cloud Platform as a service provider and the cloud consumers. The semantic interoperability layer that sits between the cloud provider and the user does the semantic description generation of the service which helps in discovering the service and invoking the service with respect to the user’s request. This proposed method is done with the cloud service called Google app engine which is Platform as a service provided by Google and the semantic web technology tool used is JRDF, a framework for RDF and SPARQL Query language. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Network forensics vis-a-vis cloud computing offerings can be leveraged to address the needs of enterprise-grade spyware solutions online. A modular, extensible cloud architecture with intrinsic support for efficient security monitoring is proposed and an implementation architecture which facilitates dynamic interface with OpenFlow hardware to create infinite flexibility in managing security decisions is presented. A forensic DataCenter model that integrates remote security monitoring using an intelligent Virtual Security Gateway in a cloud domain was developed as part of the work. An OpenFlow Virtual Appliance is proposed as a security hardware interface for thin clients connected to the Cloud Sypware Robot (CSR) server. The cloud ontology-Software as a Service (SaaS) model was used for the CSR application conveying several security benefits. The goal is to facilitate an open, service-based, online network forensics application that is transparently provisioned for users. The paper proposes a security foundation for next-generation enterprise-grade cloud computing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We are living in an era of information explosion. There are challenges with large and complex amount of data generated every day by social networks, wikis, blogs, emails, traffic system, bridges, airplanes and engine, satellites and weather sensors. 90% of current data in the world has been created in the last two years. Our smart planet becomes more and more intelligent. Besides the challenges posed by such vast amount of data including storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization, there are also much opportunities for the world as it becomes more and more digitalized. This study presents Big Data and highlights its key concepts and state-of-the-art implementation as well as research challenges and suggests research directions for future. IT log analytics, Fraud detection pattern, social media pattern and modeling and management patterns are some of opportunities. Hadoop is a cloud based and open source solution for Big Data Analytics which has been written by java. Hadoop solution is currently still immature. In this paper, three topics are suggested for research direction: Security issues in Big Data, context-aware information retrieval, and integrating ontology with Big Data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The explosion of data grows at a rate of roughly five trillion bits a second, giving rise to greater urgency in conceptualizing the infosphere (Floridi 2011) and understanding its implications for knowledge and public policy. Philosophers of technology and information technologists alike who wrestle with ontological and epistemological questions of digital information tend to emphasize, as Floridi does, information as our new ecosystem and human beings as interconnected informational organisms, inforgs at home in ambient intelligence. But the linguistic and conceptual representations of Big Data—the massive volume of both structured and unstructured data—and the real world practice of data-mining for patterns and meaningful interpretation of evidence reveal tension and ambiguity in the bold promise of data analytics. This paper explores the tacit epistemology of the rhetoric and representation of Big Data and suggests a richer account of its ambiguities and the paradox of its real world materiality. We argue that Big Data should be recognized as manifesting multiple and conflicting trajectories that reflect human intentionality and particular patterns of power and authority. Such patterns require attentive exploration and moral appraisal if we are to resist simplistic informationist ontologies of Big Data, and the subtle forms of control in the political ecology of Big Data that undermine its promise as transformational knowledge. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To date a few, big providers dominate the market of Cloud resources. They provide proprietary solutions through inflexible pricing and SLA schemes. On the research side, the community is working to define specifications and standards on several aspects of the cloud technology. When standards will get mature, interoperability among clouds will be a reality. Customers will be no more locked-up to any proprietary technology and new players will have the chance to enter the market. The competition challenge will be played on the real capability of providers to accommodate customers’ requests in a flexible way and to supply high and differentiated QoS levels. In this market scenario a mechanism must be devised to support the matchmaking between what providers offer and what customers’ applications demand. In this work we propose the definition of a semantic model that helps customers and providers to characterize their demands/offers, and provide semantic tools performing the matchmaking in such a way to maximize both the provider’s profit and the customer’s utility. The proposal has been validated by running tests on a software prototype of the discovery framework. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the pervasion of cloud computing, enterprises increasingly rely on ecosystems of distributed, task-oriented, modular, and collaborative cloud services. In order to effectively manage the complexity inherent in such ecosystems, enterprises are anticipated to depend upon brokerage mechanisms for performing policy-based governance and for recommending optimal services to consumers. Such mechanisms crucially depend upon the existence of a uniform, platform-independent representation of services, consumer preferences, and policies concerning service delivery. In this paper we propose an ontology-based approach to such a representation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Even though Cloud Computing becomes the trend, the reputation in the Cloud is still a critical issue for its adoption by cloud customers. In the recent years researches toward improving and refining the reputation have been motivated by the emergence and rapid growth of Service and Cloud Computing. These researches have produced numerous models and methods, taking into account different aspects of the reputation. Such methods often rely on statistical tools to project and estimate the reputation of services and of some of their characteristic. However, they usually fail to completely describe the inner complexity of reputation's context. In this paper we propose a definition of the Reputation relying on the use of a holistic ontology of the Cloud, ensuring both an optimal coverage of the domain and a deep semantic rooting. This definition is based on the identification of the key aspects requiring the support of the ontology for their evaluation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Commercial services are of utmost importance for the economy. Due to the widespread use of information and communication technologies, many of these services may be delivered online by means of service value networks. To automate this delivery, however, issues such as composition, integration, and operationalization need to be addressed. In this paper, the authors share their long-term vision on composition of service value networks and describe relationships with fields such as cloud computing and enterprise computing. As a demonstration of the state of the art, capabilities and limitations of e 3 service are described and research challenges are defined. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing, a common business model, provides cloud resources on demand to consumers over the Internet. However, because cloud computing lacks a uniform method of representing knowledge, which can offer customers a comprehensive solution for managing and developing cloud applications, cloud computing has low reuse potential. This work proposes a Semantic Agent as a Service (SAaaS), which was developed using Unified Modeling Language modelling. The SAaaS architecture is based on research into Cloud Computing, Semantic Web and Multi-Agent Systems. The architecture can be combined with existing cloud service models, such as Software as a Service, Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service, to design intelligent cloud computing applications. To demonstrate the efficacy of SAaaS, a Semantic-based Project Resources Sharing Platform, an intelligent cloud computing application based on the SAaaS framework, is implemented to provide project resources on demand, consistent with the needs of project members. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposed an augmented reality query-answering system (AR-QAS) based on mobile cloud computing to provide natural language informational navigation services. Empirical research was performed to examine the effectiveness of the system in actual use. This study confirms that the new model developed by combining technology acceptance model (TAM), media richness theory, and the factors of self-efficacy can be applied to relevant AR research. The experiment results revealed that the average question classification accuracy of QAS when combined with artificial neural network and ontology was 98.76%. Moreover, the perceived media richness was found to be positively related to self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, user attitude, and use intention. Furthermore, this study reveals that combining the TAM and media richness theory provides a stronger explanation than does the TAM alone. Before new systems are created, designers are suggested to consider the four factors of media richness theory (i.e., multiple cues, language variety, timely feedback, and personal focus), to greatly improve user attitudes toward and behavioral intentions to use new technologies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is the blending technology of parallel and distributing computing, and its main aim is providing Everything as a Service to the consumers. The private cloud is one of the deployment models and it offers resources in an on-demand manner. Resource Management is the challenging task between different private cloud because of the interoperability issues since the private clouds are managed by different type of cloud middleware's and each of them has their own mechanism and protocols. To manage the resource efficiently and to increase the resource availability it is essential to overcome the interoperability issues between the private clouds. In this paper a common mechanism called Semantic Cloud Resource Broker (SCRB) is introduced between the Eucalyptus and Open Nebula based private clouds. It also includes the semantic technology to achieve meaningful search. Hence an OWL-based ontology indexing and retrieval algorithms is implemented to improve precision and recall and thereby improves the success rate of cloud resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud Security is one of the foremost concerns among related stakeholders. Each concern brings diverse effects on discrete assets while analyzing the security issues in Cloud Computing. In spite of various studies, we still fail to define the needs of security, resulting in a slow pace in cloud adoption. Accordingly, a fresh approach is required to facilitate end-users and service providers to better understand the domain so that they can easily address their security requirements and find their solutions. Out of different security measures used by related stakeholders one is 'ontology-based security approach,' which creates a conceptual relationship among entities representing information, having systematic review for the purpose of identifying, analyzing and eliciting security countermeasures. Previous studies reveal a variety of security ontologies that can be used by the service providers, which have different approaches to assess the security; still, cloud service providers and end users find it complicating and lacking in security sphere as there is no specification, which ontology should be used at what condition. Hence, there is an emergent need for a critical review of prior studies related to Cloud Security Ontology. This paper presents a brief discussion on five major ontologies namely: Cloud Ontology, Takeshi Takahashi et al.'s Ontology, CoCoOn, Subramani Keerthana et al.'s Ontology and Nelson Gonzalez et al.'s Taxonomy dwelling upon their strengths and weaknesses. A comparative study is also accomplished using various attributes, which are identified based on the well-known practices with similar studies in security domain. Further, future research directions based on comparative study and the weaknesses sections have also been explored to facilitate the researchers in related areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Resource Description Framework (RDF) pioneered by the W3C is increasingly being adopted to model data in a variety of scenarios, in particular data to be published or exchanged on the Web. Managing large volumes of RDF data is challenging, due to the sheer size, the heterogeneity, and the further complexity brought by RDF reasoning. To tackle the size challenge, distributed storage architectures are required. Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm massively adopted in many applications for the scalability, fault-tolerance, and elasticity feature it provides, enabling the easy deployment of distributed and parallel architectures. In this article, we survey RDF data management architectures and systems designed for a cloud environment, and more generally, those large-scale RDF data management systems that can be easily deployed therein. We first give the necessary background, then describe the existing systems and proposals in this area, and classify them according to dimensions related to their capabilities and implementation techniques. The survey ends with a discussion of open problems and perspectives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is a promising business and computing model. The cloud storage is an essential and most used service, which provides stable and massive data storage space to end users. In this research work, new private cloud storage architecture is proposed with decentralized indexing which is based on peer to peer network. The proposed cloud architecture has semantic middleware for data storage. It is designed for a cloud based environment where client interacts with cloud which is comprised of peers. The private cloud will be available to clients through internet. Each peer in the network contributes its resources to form private cloud. The client can store whole file without dividing into chunks. The various modules in middleware performed different tasks to store and retrieve files from cloud. The ontology is created in Protégé-OWL to make it reusable and ease of management. The proposed architecture is being implemented using latest Java NetBeans framework with Jena API for ontology management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid development of the cloud computing, massive information is distributed in the structure 'cloud storage', leading to the heterogeneous data sources, and the 'lost phenomenon' may occur in the process of information retrieval. To solve this problem, this paper builds the heterogeneous data integration model in the cloud computing environment, which includes three layers and five function modules: data acquisition and analysis interface in the cloud, data organization task scheduling engine, and heterogeneous data integrated interface based on the ontology. Also, common technologies used in unified retrieval of heterogeneous data resources are presented in this paper, such as parallel retrieval technology, server cluster retrieval technology, webpage's deep mining technology and retrieval database sharing technology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Approaches to share resources across administrative domains have been developed for many years. A specific field of application is the experimental evaluation of Future Internet related research within federated facilities. Testbeds that want to offer support for this experiment life cycle have to expose multiple interfaces along with mechanisms to allow handovers between them. Existing work rest upon self-contained software components that are bound to specific protocols and schematic data models that aggravate such handovers. As a result, for a testbed the process of joining one or multiple federations is an expensive process. We propose an approach that reutilizes insights of the Semantic Web research to address parts of this issue. In this paper, we describe a framework which abstracts from specific protocols and functionalities by managing heterogeneous resources based on a semantic information model. As a result, different API calls relate to the semantically same resources which allows theses handovers and further makes this approach applicable to related fields such a federated cloud computing. We have validated our work within several research projects and further show that the implementation is standard compliant. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomedical ontologies play a vital role in healthcare information management, data integration, and decision support. Ontology quality assurance (OQA) is an indispensable part of the ontology engineering cycle. Most existing OQA methods are based on the knowledge provided within the targeted ontology. This paper proposes a novel cross-ontology analysis method, Cross-Ontology Hierarchical Relation Examination (COHeRE), to detect inconsistencies and possible errors in hierarchical relations across multiple ontologies. COHeRE leverages the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge source and the MapReduce cloud computing technique for systematic, large-scale ontology quality assurance work. COHeRE consists of three main steps with the UMLS concepts and relations as the input. First, the relations claimed in source vocabularies are filtered and aggregated for each pair of concepts. Second, inconsistent relations are detected if a concept pair is related by different types of relations in different source vocabularies. Finally, the uncovered inconsistent relations are voted according to their number of occurrences across different source vocabularies. The voting result together with the inconsistent relations serve as the output of COHeRE for possible ontological change. The highest votes provide initial suggestion on how such inconsistencies might be fixed. In UMLS, 138,987 concept pairs were found to have inconsistent relationships across multiple source vocabularies. 40 inconsistent concept pairs involving hierarchical relationships were randomly selected and manually reviewed by a human expert. 95.8% of the inconsistent relations involved in these concept pairs indeed exist in their source vocabularies rather than being introduced by mistake in the UMLS integration process. 73.7% of the concept pairs with suggested relationship were agreed by the human expert. The effectiveness of COHeRE indicates that UMLS provides a promising environment to enhance qualities of biomedical ontologies by performing cross-ontology examination.

AB  - With the rapid development of cloud computing and service computing, Web services are combined to form the composite service with a large granularity is an important research direction at present. The current service composition methods have the problems of low composition efficiency and accuracy, this paper proposes a semantic Web service composition method based on the binary tree. This method uses the ontology semantic reasoning relationship and binary tree theory to composite Web services. The composition relations between Web service interfaces are mainly considered. The approach can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of service composition, and the experiments are used to validate and analyze the proposed methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Many problems may occur when storing ontology into the relational database, such as semantic information loss, information redundancy and so on. Graph database has a natural graph structure, which can relieve the above problems. So far many articles have only touched upon the RDF and graph database but not on the common ontology. A method is put forward in this paper used for storing ontology into the graph database. In the article, a general model of mapping ontology to graph is presented and its algorithm is given. A prototype system is implemented to map an ontology to a graph and store it into a graph-database automatically. The test results based on the system illustrate the mapping model and the algorithm are universal for the ontology. And many queries can be done in the graph-database which are similar to those in ontology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has become a widely used concept. It is characterized by its elasticity, its on demand services and the unlimited resources provided to end users. However, the increase of services number offered by different providers causes sometimes ambiguity problems. So, ontology must be used to relate between different services in order to facilitate their access. Many languages expressing ontology have been proposed namely RDF, OWL, etc. To access them, queries should be expressed using SPARQL. However, generally, users are not familiar with this query language. Therefore, there is a need to an interface allowing them to express their requirements without any expertise in SPARQL language. Besides, given the increase of complex service requirements, it is sometimes necessary to compose services to meet final user requirements. This paper gives related works on Cloud service discovery based on ontology and composition and presents a system ensuring these procedures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Virtual Hazards Impact & Risk Laboratory (VHIRL) is a scientific workflow portal that provides researchers with access to a cloud computing environment for natural hazards eRe-search tools. It allows researchers to construct experiments with data from a variety of sources and execute cloud computing processes for rapid and remote simulation and analysis. The service currently includes tools for the simulation of three major hazards affecting the Asia-Pacific region: earthquakes, tsunamis and tropical cyclones. For scientific results, the establishment of provenance is key to reproducibility and trust. Thus the need for any virtual laboratory to provide provenance information for the tasks it manages is obvious, but the appropriate way to report and manage provenance information is not always so straightforward. Many virtual laboratories and workflow systems provide bespoke provenance management with a focus on internal system use. This has clear benefits for reproducibility within the system, but it limits the interoperability of systems. For VHIRL, a provenance solution was required that was as interoperable with other, external, provenance systems as possible. A related common issue facing workflow tools and virtual laboratories is the need to manage software code. With this comes well-known issues associated with code sharing: licensing, source code management, version management and dependency resolution. There are a wide selection of commonly used tools to help solve these problems, for example Git and Subversion. A key goal of VHIRL was to externalise as much information management as was reasonable. VHIRL is a virtual laboratory: it is not designed to be a data store, software repository, or records management system. A solution was required that could hand off the management of provenance records and code to external services, with links between them, other data services and VHIRL jobs where appropriate. Scientific software can be quite complicated and systems for managing dependencies and source vary from system to system. In order to provide the least friction for authors of software, we designed a system called the Scientific Software Solution Centre (SSSC) to manage solutions to scientific problems and deliver the solution templates, code and dependencies that enable them for use in VHIRL and other Virtual Laboratories and applications. We discuss our integration of the PROMS provenance toolkit into VHIRL in order to generate standardised provenance reports according to the W3C's PROV ontology. We describe the collection of provenance information through the VHIRL service and the submission of that information to an external provenance system. We also present the SSSC design as an example of how to meet the disparate requirements of managing scientific codes and solutions while dealing with publishing, discovery, licensing and versioning. We show how the SSSC assists in provenance report generation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The proposed eHealth Recommendation Service System (eHeaRSS) is to recommend health service information to patients whenever and wherever. Nowadays, depending on online networks popularity, there are a lot of research starting to focus on patient-context to apply health care fields like tele-health, tele-care, medical traveling, and so on. The proposed eHeaRSS is like a family doctor to care patients, especially to use generated patients-context. eHeaRSS is a recommendation system for immediate and appropriate medical services using crowd sourcing in cloud computing environment. To do this, it is necessary to classify the data into symptoms, diseases, departments and doctors related data types. To consider hierarchies or subsume relationships among them, eHeaRSS Ontology (eHeaRSS-Ont) is developed through integration of 4-static ontology (4-Ont) which is comprised of symptom-, disease-, department-and doctor-Ont to create tailored recommendations depending on patient-context. For the recommendation service, Case-based reasoning (CBR) is applied. The extracted cases using 4-Ont are integrated by eHeaRSS-Ont depending on the patient-context. For customization, it is necessary to reconfigure the case using eHeaRSS Constraints Value Compatibility Map (eHeaRSS-CVCM). To prove the significance and efficiency of the eHeaRSS, we experimented using ontology-based data processing and proved the superiority of eHeaRSS with the provision of better recommendation than other DB-based systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the explosive growth of medical information, the users not only query information efficiently and accurately, but also pay attention to the information of sensitivity and privacy. In medical domains, the current privacy preserving methods either use the technology of Access Control List, or need to prepare training documents for each privacy policy. However, it is a time-consuming and impractical way for data owners to assign a privacy policy on each document. In this paper, by exploiting the privacy medical queries, we propose a novel approach based on semantic and ontology to achieve the topic-level privacy preserving search. With the support of them, we first mine all the potential hierarchy and semantics from a user query and acquire sensitive terms relative to privacy policies automatically without training documents. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - While trying to maintain sustainable competitive advantage, IT service providers are challenged with tremendous service complexity and a low level of flexibility caused by the lack of transparency, constrained scalability and the missing ability to identify needed service measures proactively. For overcoming these challenges, this paper presents a well-evaluated set of identified key requirements for a feasible realization of a highly scalable cloud based architecture that supports predictive analytics in several domains of IT Service Management. This presented concept goes far beyond traditional approaches and pertinent state-of-the-art software solutions by focusing on business analyses based on knowledge creation and domain-independent knowledge sharing. The proposed approach is based on profound analyses of related work as well as modern service oriented design and business analyses paradigms. It provides semantic complexity handling, structured and multi-layered service interaction, cloud-enabled scalability management as well as predictive business analyses based on semantic reasoning, decision-making support and pattern recognition. The derived results eventually provide solution architects with a feasible and technical independent fundament for architectural implementation decisions. It ultimately enables IT service providers to cope with modern flexibility needs and complexity challenges and therefore to continuously satisfy customers to gain competitive advantage. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is a model delivery of infrastructure, platform and software services over the net. The lack of standardization of heterogeneous Cloud service descriptions makes service discovery and selection very complex tasks for Cloud users. To ease this complexity, it is crucial to describe the various Cloud service pertinent information in a homogeneous model. To provide for such model, this paper offers to contributions. First, it proposes a Cloud description ontology that integrates service descriptions obtained from heterogeneous sources. The ontology model accounts for the functional and non-functional properties, attributes and relations of infrastructure, platform and software services in order to facilitate the discovery and selection of suitable Cloud services. Second, this paper presents a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed ontology. For the qualitative evaluation, we use a reasoner to identify defects in the ontology, whilst for the quantitative evaluation we compare our search results with those obtained through a web search engine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The term "trust" in the area of cloud computing has always been one of the most problematic issues. The cloud user becomes willing to accept insecure conditions and unconsciously increases these conditions' security level if he is able to find a strategy that provides trust. This level of trust, once established, is difficult to maintain if any deception takes place. The indications of proven trust can only be seen in future usage of a cloud service. For this reason, specific control instruments are required to ascertain the accuracy of one's trust. The establishment of trust in a public cloud environment requires a paradigm change: a holistic strategy that enforces regulation requirements throughout the cloud architecture. The movement of the root of trust into hardware reduces vulnerability to compromise, as hardware attacks require a high expenditure of time and effort. Cloud users would define regulation standards through trust-worthy IT instruments and enforce them in specific cloud-service layers. The extension of this approach is the regulation of SaaS-based applications to enforce requirements for separation and availability. This work introduces a conceptual approach to establish a chain of policy by using hardware-oriented root of trust. The conceptual description of a chain of policy outlines the main principles to enforce regulations accurately for each architectural cloud layer based on an established chain of trust. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advancements in technology and liberalization of educational opportunities have transformed the knowledge landscape into an emergent innovation incubator, where sense-making and creativity in and for ill-structured environments are especially relevant. In addition, opportunities are often "found" or "made." The quality of solutions, however, is mediated by different conceptualizations of contexts. As such, we need new teaching-learning models which help students to become more effective and creative knowledge builders and creative innovators. In this paper, we present a summary of our prior work towards this objective, our framework and the refined assessment rubric derived from our various studies. Our design factors/scaffolds are: design thinking as design methodology, metacognitive reflective scaffolds and formative assessment as framing technique. We hope our findings can be applied to the learning of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and its variants. Future work may involve its application to MOOCs or Cloud Computing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the wide spread of cloud computing, arises actual question about architecture, design and implementation of cloud applications. The microservice model describes the design and development of loosely coupled cloud applications when computing resources are pro- vided on the basis of automated IaaS and PaaS cloud platforms. Such applications consist of hundreds and thousands of service instances, so automated validation and testing of cloud applications developed on the basis of microservice model is a pressing issue. There are constantly de- veloping new methods of testing both individual microservices and cloud applications at a whole. This article presents our vision of a framework for the validation of the microservice cloud applications, providing an integrated approach for the implementation of various testing methods of such applications, from basic unit tests to continuous stability testing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Power dimensioning and energy saving have been traditionally two main issues regarding the deployment of electric grids. Electric railways are also concerned about these issues, and simulators have been traditionally used to test such infrastructure deployments. The main goal of this paper is to present the Railway electric Power Consumption Simulator, a simulation model and tool for the railway energy provisioning problem. This simulator aims to propose electric railway infrastructure deployments, optimizing the quality of the electric flow supplied to train, as well as saving as much energy as possible. The paper describes the simulator structure, as well as the ontology used to translate railway infrastructure elements into an electric circuit. Because these two objectives are conflicting, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved. Finally, a standard railway scenario is used to illustrate the capabilities of the tool, trying to find the best electric substation placements in order to optimize such objectives. The evaluation shows how the tool can handle hundreds of simulated scenarios using Cloud Computing techniques. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To gain profit of cloud services is an emergency process growing along with the population and exposure; it involves users’ ability to select appropriate services in these emergency situations, and it can be tackled through communication mechanisms of annotation for cloud services and resources over cloud service layers. Cloud services are on demand over the network as a service style of cloud computing. How can we meet users’ access to a shared pool of resources? So this work focuses on proposing a method for annotation and searching the services over an open cloud computing source environment, that is constituting group communication entities using an open source platform. To access the services more intelligently, therefore we should explore the availability of machine readable and web service semantics expressed by ontology. This article presents an ontology annotation and methodology-based cloud service layers, demonstrated by using ontology-based cloud architecture, which will assist the implementation of services discovered and accessed intelligently using semantic web queries; administrative burden of the cloud is considerably reduced, and the final algorithm implementation is based on ontology. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The governance of privacy and personal information on cloud environments is challenging and complex. Usually many regulatory frameworks intervene to reflect diverse privacy wishes from several stakeholders. This includes data owners, data and services providers and also the end users. Focusing mainly on medical domains, this issue is particularly important due to the sensitivity of health related data in international data protection law. It is therefore essential to integrate heterogeneous privacy requirements in a semantic model and rules. Thereafter, overlaps, contradictions and similarities of privacy wishes could be detected and a final access control context would be captured before it is finally mapped to clouds operational policies. This paper describes a ontology-based semantic model of privacy requirements along with a logical formalism for mapping SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) privacy rules to a policy language that is implementable on clouds environments namely XACML. The underline implementation requirements for our formalism will be also explained. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There is an ever-growing number of diverse RDF documents available on the Web, and most of them are published following Linked Data principles. To indicate the current status of data interconnection, we analyze structural properties of these linked RDF documents. We propose a document link graph (DocGraph) to model links between documents, and analyze its structure from three aspects: degree distribution, morphological structure, and reachability. We report our experiments on structural properties of the graph using two crawls, each with about 10 million documents. We find that the DocGraph is scale-free, and with small average distance. Its structure in 2012 is close to that of the Hyper-text Web in the years around 2001-2002, and is not as good as the structure of the Hypertext Web in later years. Therefore, we conclude that data interlinking is very necessary for the Web of Data. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the development of the Linked Data, an increasing number of RDF data sets are published in many application domains. To understand the underlying meaning and characteristics of large RDF data, and to reuse popular domain terms when publishing data, capturing emerging pragmatic patterns is critical. In this paper, we propose the notion of term co-instantiation graph (TIG) and a method to build a TIG for a given RDF dataset. We also describe a clustering-based approach to distill a set of pragmatic patterns from a TIG, which reveal the pragmatic custom of highly-correlated terms. Through extensive experiments on a real big dataset containing 21 M RDF documents, we analyze the macroscopic structure of the term co-instantiation graph and pragmatic patterns from the complex network point of view, and demonstrate our approach can not only give an elaborated ontology partitioning from the pragmatic perspective to ease the ontology reuse, but also provide a new way to explore the Linked Data. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing has opened a new era in e-commerce. As the growth and complexity of public and private clouds increases, novel solutions are needed, enabling vendors to effectively manage the cloud-based distribution of their services. To this end, this paper presents a novel semantic framework with the main aim to support providers in the overall cloud-based service provision process, in terms of service ownership, licensing, and usage monitoring. The base of our framework is an ontological schema that models service business rules definition and license agreements registration, as well as service usage monitoring, with a special focus on web service and software applications cloud-based distribution. Our proposed ontology supports complex distribution schemas, related to multiple vendor-based service distribution, as well as personalized discount schemas, facilitating the deployment of marketing strategies during cloud-based service provision. On top of this ontological schema, we have further developed service and provider reputation and trust inference mechanisms, which operate on the basis of both service usage statistics and subjective end user feedback. Taking a step forward from the state of the art, our mechanisms also provide personalized discount suggestions, further facilitating providers in defining marketing strategies. Apart from supporting providers, our mechanisms also facilitate users in service and provider selection. In order to examine the application of our framework in practice, we have developed a user interface that provides basic features of our framework, within the context of a real cloud, oriented toward personalized cloud service provision; our framework has been integrated in the "Cloud4All" Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII). © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Roles and capabilities of analysts are changing as the volume of data grows. Open-source content is abundant and users are becoming increasingly dependent on automated capabilities to sift and correlate information. Entity resolution is one such capability. It is an algorithm that links entities using an arbitrary number of criteria (e.g., identifiers, attributes) from multiple sources. This paper demonstrates a prototype capability, which identifies enriched attributes of individuals stored across multiple sources. Here, the system first completes its processing on a cloud-computing cluster. Then, in a data explorer role, the analyst evaluates whether automated results are correct and whether attribute enrichment improves knowledge discovery. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - CloudComputing has several provisionmodels, e.g. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). However, cloud users (tenants) have limited or no control over the underlying network resources. Network as a Service (NaaS) is emerging as a novelmodel to fill this gap.However,NaaS requires an approach capable of modeling the underlying network resources capabilities in abstracted and vendor-independent form. In this paper we elaborate on SemNaaS, a Semantic Web based approach for developing and supporting operations of NaaS systems. SemNaaS can workwith any NaaS provider. We integrated it with the existing OpenNaaS framework. We propose Network Markup Language (NML) as the ontology for describing networking infrastructures.Based on that ontology, we develop a network modeling system and integrate with OpenNaaS. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities that Semantic Web can add to the NaaS paradigm by applying SemNaaS operations to a specific NaaS use case. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper a Personalized Virtual Learning Environment (PVLE) architecture is presented which integrates three components is as follows: (I) the Learning Management System (LMS); (II) the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE); and (III) the Ontological Model (OM). The components were implemented as a solution for Cloud Computing. The fieldwork considered two stages: a proof of concept that is used as a benchmark and test cases where the PVLE were applied. We observed during the performance of stage 1 the average scores for thought styles (logical processes, creative, relational) considerably remain unchanged. While in stage 2, we observed the scores average has increased, with a tendency to improve creative, logical and process styles. Therefore, there is a significant contribution in the development of students’ cognitive profile to personalize its learning activities and the use of PVLE. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the Cloud4all Service Synthesizer Tool, a framework that enables efficient orchestration of accessibility services, as well as their combination into complex forms, providing more advanced functionalities towards increasing the accessibility of end-users with various types of functional limitations. The supported services are described formally within an ontology, enabling, thus, semantic service composition. The proposed service composition approach is based on semantic matching between services specifications on the one hand and user needs/preferences and current context of use on the other hand. The use of automatic composition of accessibility services can significantly enhance end-users' accessibility, especially in cases where assistive solutions are not available in their device. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data federation and virtualization in SaaS environments is one of the issues present in cloud environments. Within human resource management information systems, there is a huge amount of data that other corporate applications are needed to access and manipulate. Meta4 is one of the leaders in Human and intellectual capital sectors both in SaaS and on premise scenarios. This paper presents a framework to select the best option for data access in SaaS environment from the developer side using the Analytic Hierarchy Process enriched by an ontological representation of it. This framework would be useful for all SaaS service providers willing to open SaaS data to their customers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Innovation in technology-enhanced learning (TEL) is constantly evolving, and social media, MOOCs and big data are some of the technologies improving education through cloud environments. A cloud education environment (CEE) uses external cloud-based applications for learning activities. This paper will explore on technical interoperability using a semantic web solution for cloud-based tools (CBT) in an educational setting. It will focus on the use case of online document editors for learning activities and present a proposed generic ontology for interoperability of online document editor tools. This work describes a proposal using Web APIs for integration and interoperability. The focus of this paper is to provide a description of the common characteristics of online document editor tools, such as their resources, operations, and properties, which will create a definition of a generic vocabulary for further interoperability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The continuing advances in cloud computing technology, infrastructures, applications, and hybrid cloud have led to provide solutions to challenges in big data and high performance computing applications. The increasing number of cloud service providers offering cloud services with nonuniform descriptions has made it time consuming to find the best match service with the user’s requirements. This paper is an effort to speed up the service discovery and selection of IaaS cloud services which is „best-match“ to the user requirements. Preliminary experiments provided promising results which demonstrates the viability of the approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Embedding Web 2.0 in learning processes has extended learning from traditional based learning-centred to a collaborative based learning-centred institution that emphasises learning anywhere and anytime. While deploying Semantic Web into e-learning offers a broader spectrum of pervasive knowledge acquisition to enrich users' experience in learning. In conventional learning practices, a student is perceived as a recipient of information and knowledge. However, nowadays many institutions involve students in learning processes that play an active role in improving collaborative learning platform and knowledge sharing as well as participation. For education provider, choosing a collaborative learning platform is becoming more important than choosing a tool in the new paradigm. Implementing collaborative learning through Web 2.0 is attributed to e-learning 2.0 as an approach for an online learning solution. Researchers have employed contents analysis for reviewing literatures in peer-reviewed journals. In fact, researchers found e-learning 2.0 is not only addressing the need redefining technologies like cloud computing in e-learning but also the need of redefining value added through pervasive knowledge generated from Semantic Web and Social networks. E-learning 2.0 can be a solution to make learning systems in a higher education is flexible in terms of resources adoption, pervasive knowledge acquisition, and cloud computing implementation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is moving from being a testing ground for isolated projects to being a strategic approach of the entire business organization. So the choice among the possible cloud offers, with a strong focus on the choice of services that enable better processes and projects of the business lines, is gaining importance. Nevertheless the heterogeneity of the Cloud services, resources, technology and service levels offered by the several providers make difficult to decide. Besides the inconveniences caused by the “lock-in”, give rise to the need for developers to be able to develop an application regardless of where it is released, structuring and building it in a vendor agnostic way so that it is possible to deploy on the provider that best fits them at the moment. The mOSAIC project aims at designing and developing an innovative open-source API and platform that enables applications to be Cloud providers’ neutral and to negotiate Cloud services as requested by their users, allowing automatic discovery, matchmaking, and thus supporting selection, brokering, interoperability end even composition of Cloud Services among multiple Clouds. In this paper, we illustrate the interoperation of the two components, the Semantic Engine and the Cloud Agency for the agnostic retrieval, discovery and brokering of cloud services. The focus will be put on the way to support the Cloud Application Developer to express the requirements and services/resources in vendor agnostic way and to translate automatically these requirements into a neutral format in order to compare it with the different offers of providers and to broker the best one according to defined policies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the advancements made in ecommerce technologies over the past years, the inability to define and exchange semantically rich and accurate product information among ecommerce websites/applications has continued to intrigue researchers. This problem has taken on greater urgency because it impedes the realization of the full benefits of Ecommerce 3. 0. The present research conceptualizes, designs and implements a cloud computing-based platform that enables global merchants to maintain a collaborative Electronic Product Catalog (EPC) known as Productpedia. This collaborative EPC platform addresses numerous shortcomings of prior researches by (1) maintaining a single centralized EPC database; (2) negating the need to synchronize and convert data; (3) creating an integrated meta-model ontology for merchants to define previously unclassified product information without the involvement of domain experts; and (4) enabling an Open Application Programming Interface based on RESTful web services to facilitate direct modification of the EPC database by even third-party applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to make reservations for cloud services, consumers and providers need to work on Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to achieve negotiation. Since cloud computing represents a category of distributed system, negotiation should be established between service providers and consumers in a faster and reliable manner. Automated Negotiation is such a process that is closely associated with Multi-agent Systems. We propose A Negotiation system using fuzzy ontology is addressed by us in this research work where the cloud service specification and consumer requirements with vagueness are stored on cloud ontology. Here, each party needs to choose its own agent in order for negotiation. Agents have both consumer’s and provider’s details and their hard and soft preferences for a particular service. Agents need to negotiate on the basis of a set of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like duration, availability, price etc. as required by the user. On completion of the negotiation process, user receives a feedback from the agent regarding the probability of negotiation. This negotiation framework is dynamic and efficient in nature. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The revision of the Joint Directors of the Laboratories (JDL) Information Fusion model in 2004 discussed information processing, incorporated the analyst, and was coined the Data Fusion Information Group (DFIG) model. Since that time, developments in information technology (e.g., cloud computing, applications, and multimedia) have altered the role of the analyst. Data production has outpaced the analyst; however the analyst still has the role of data refinement and information reporting. In this paper, we highlight three examples being addressed by the DFIG model. One example is the role of the analyst to provide semantic queries (through an ontology) so that vast amount of data available can be indexed, accessed, retrieved, and processed. The second idea is reporting which requires the analyst to collect the data into a condensed and meaningful form through information management. The last example is the interpretation of the resolved information from data that must include contextual information not inherent in the data itself. Through a literature review, the DFIG developments in the last decade demonstrate the usability of the DFIG model to bring together the user (analyst or operator) and the machine (information fusion or manager) in a systems design. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Service Level Agreements (SLA) is the principal means of control which defines the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in cloud computing. These requirements have to be guaranteed in order to avoid costly SLA violations. However, elasticity strategies, which have not been deeply considered yet in SLA documents, may significantly ameliorate the QoS. Therefore, in this paper, our aim is to guarantee the QoS by introducing the semantic meaning of the elasticity strategies in SLA. In this regard, we propose an ontology-based elasticity approach which allows getting an elastic cloud service by dynamically apply corrective actions. These corrective actions present the elasticity strategies applied following a violation or in prediction of a violation. Our proposed approach allows getting an interactive and flexible SLA document in order to maintain a reliable QoS and respect the SLA parameters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The powerful evolution of hardware, software and data connectivity of mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) stimulates people to publish and share their personal data (like social network information or sensor readings) independently of spatial and temporal constraints. To do this, the development of an efficient semantic web collaborative editor for mobile devices is needed. However, collaboratively editing a shared semantic web document in real-time through ad-hoc peer-to-peer mobile networks requires increasing amounts of computation, data storage and network communication. In this paper, we propose a new cloud service-based model that allows a real-time co-authoring of Linked-Data (LD) as a RDF (Resource Description Framework) graph using mobile devices. Our model is built upon two layers: (i) cloning engine that enables users to clone their mobile devices in the cloud to delegate the overload of collaborative tasks and provides peer-to-peer networks where users can create ad-hoc groups; (ii) Collaborative engine that allows updating freely and concurrently a shared RDF graph in peerto- peer fashion without requiring a central server. This work represents a step forward toward a practical and flexible co-authoring environment for LD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is an innovative and one of the significantly achieved developments in the cloud computing environment. Providing security to the cloud virtual machines and users' data are the greatest challenge of information system. So, understanding the risks of the security and privacy in the cloud and developing efficient and effective solutions for it is really a difficult task. This manuscript describes about the mathematical ontology and a new model based on the Lakota-Volterra equation known as Predator-Prey Model which predicts the trustworthiness of the IaaS virtual platform. The proposed research would minimize the threats to the virtual machines in the cloud environment irrespective of the user's applications and security policy. It will basically ensure the degree of the security of virtual machines in a cloud environment which helps the cloud service providers to take the quick decisions and about the up gradation of the counter attack measurements. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We argue that the incorporation of cloud service brokerage (CSB) mechanisms will strengthen the resilience of services in cloud-based VEs. In this respect, we present the Service Completeness-Compliance Checker (SC3), a mechanism which offers capabilities with respect to the Quality Assurance dimension of CSB. More specifically, SC3 strengthens the resilience of cloud services by evaluating their compliance with pre-specified policies concerning the business aspects of their delivery. By relying on an ontology-based representation of policies and services, SC3 achieves a proper separation of concerns between policy definition and policy enforcement. This effectively enables SC3 to perform policy evaluation in a manner generic and agnostic to the underlying cloud delivery platform utilised by a cloud-based VE. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud related legal documents, like terms of service or customer agreement are usually managed as plain text files. Hence extensive manual effort is required to monitor the cloud service performance by cross referencing the metrics and measures agreed upon in these documents. We have significantly automated the process of managing and monitoring cloud Service Level Agreements (SLA) using semantic web technologies like OWL, RDF and SPARQL. In this paper, we describe in detail the cloud SLA ontology and the prototype that we have developed to illustrate how the SLA measures can be automatically extracted from legal Terms of Service that are available on cloud provider websites. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Cloud Computing paradigm has been adopted in countless areas of application and forms the basis of a growing number of business cases. Similar to the situation with service providers in the 1980th, it becomes apparent that different Cloud providers build walled gardens around their offerings. While multiple projects and organizations are working on standards for federating Cloud domains, the scalable exchange of descriptions about heterogeneous resources are often not well considered. Our approach is to adopt both, ideas initially developed for the Internet to defne a scalable architecture and concepts from the Semantic Web to defne a canonical Intercloud ontology. An initial implementation of the architecture has been developed to form a basis for further refnement of the proposed concepts. As a result, we have defned an initial ontology for Intercloud resources and implemented a catalog for the IEEE Intercloud architecture. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing is the new technology that can access the data and applications from anywhere. The service is non-inheritable on associate as-needed basis and might be termed as service on demand. Typically, the service is hosted on a cloud or a computing grid and is delivered to the organization via the net or mobile devices. Maintaining a conventional IT infrastructure is progressively unable to accommodate the growing range of private devices such as tablets, good phones, and laptops that students bring into the field. To resolve this drawback the projected system presents a brand new integrated methodology for the life cycle of IT services delivered on the cloud and repair necessities then automatism, service acquisition and consumption from the cloud. The IT services life cycle is divided into five phases as requirements, discovery, negotiation, composition, and consumption. The IT service lifecycle is developed and demonstrated by using a semantic web technology which includes a cloud storage service prototype. The archetype allows cloud consumer to discover and acquire disk storage on the cloud by specifying the service attributes, security policies and compliance policies. The proposed methodology will enable the practitioners to plan, create and deploy virtualized services successfully. The key reason to have a semantically rich approach is to automate the process of acquisition and consumption of cloud services. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Several powerful trends are contributing to a “graying” of much of the world’s population, especially in economically-developed countries. This inexorable shift in demographics is already starting to place significant economic burdens on those still in the workforce and on society as a whole. To mitigate the negative effects of rapidly ageing populations, societies must act early to plan for the welfare, medical care and residential arrangements of their senior citizens, and for the manpower and associated training needed to execute these plans. A key aspect of these efforts is developments of information technology to automatically provide personal care services with comprehensive real-time data on the charges. This article describes the development of a “RESTful driven Ambient Intelligent Care Services Platform” (RACS) for aging-in-place in the Cloud, which creates an environment of Ambient Intelligence through the use of Ontology, Restful Web Services, Sensor Networks and Mobile Agent technologies. The RACS presented in this paper is capable of offering pervasive, accurate and contextually-aware personal care services. Architecturally the REST-implemented RACS leverages Restful web service and Cloud Computing to provide economic, scalable, and robust healthcare services over the Internet. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the massive adoption of cloud computing, a growing number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) now have the opportunity, together with the immediate goal of reducing cost, to effectively expose their services or group themselves into clusters or virtual enterprises in order to build and expose customised offerings. Different requirements, ranging from interoperability and portability, provisioning and reconfiguration, security and privacy, or monitoring and auditing, can all be controlled through the lifecycle support of cloud services and grouped under the umbrella of different virtual enterprises. A semantic support is essential to enable such an entity, and to foster collaboration among different virtual enterprises by providing specific mechanisms by which the construction of complex services from elementary building blocks can be made possible. At the same time it actively supports tasks like automation of cloud resource usage, efficient monitoring and scaling of cloud services, either individually or based on specific dependencies, or replacement and termination of services when the initial offers are no longer available. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the past few years, cloud computing has become a key IT buzzword. A growing number of cloud providers started to expose their own services to the market, to answer consumer's need, engaging a competition in the attempt to offer the easiest access to resources and the widest catalogue of services. However, the current lack of a shared standard for the description of such services can represent an obstacle to the development of interoperable and portable cloud solutions. In this scenario, developers could benefit from an automatic tool or technique to identify the architectural solution best answering their requests. In this work we are presenting our approach to the semantic description of cloud resources, comprehending both a general and agnostic representation of such services and a focus on provider specific solutions. Also, we illustrate how the proposed description can be queried and further extended, by means of logical rules, in order to retrieve and assess new information on services equivalences. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The OCCIware project aims at building a comprehensive, coherent while modular model-driven toolchain for managing any kinds of cloud resources, especially Data Center as a Service, Deployment as a Service, Big Data as a Service, and Linked Open Data as a Service. Leveraging the Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) and its core model, the OCCIware toolchain applies a model-driven engineering approach based on a formal model of cloud resources and systems. This approach allows for better modularity, clear separation between functional (cloud resources) and non-functional concerns (security, scalability, reliability, etc.). The project brings together ten French partners - academics, SMEs, associations - and is supervised by a Strategic Orientation Committee of eleven top industrial and academic experts. The OCCIware project has been selected by French Ministry of Industry and funded by French Banque Publique d'Investissement (BPI). © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explains how ontology can be used to model various IaaS architectures. OpenStack is the largest open source cloud computing IaaS platform. It has been gaining wide spread popularity among users as well as software and hardware vendors over past few years. It’s a very flexible system that can support a wide range of virtualization scenarios at scale. In our work we propose a formalization of OpenStack architectural model that can be automatically validated and provide suitable meta-data to configuration management tools. The OWL-DL based ontology defines service components and their relations and provides foundation for further reasoning. Model defined architectures can support simple all-in-one architecture as as well as large architectures with clustered service components to achieve High Availability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Many shifts of the web developments and utilizations with complex convergence internet technology still incomplete with emerging technologies like cloud computing, cognitive computing etc. in facilitating a guaranteed dynamic and live accurate information service with cross platforms and with humanoid mechanisms. After many computing generations still human intelligence misused and wrongly guided to read, store and reuse that information from the internet core web systems. Some of the basic principles are under- covered and completely neglected in programming part of computing technologies. At present we are experiencing those results in terms searching, identifying, selecting the actual content from the repeatedly presented results of replicated servers. This case not only in search engines including every computing service in web a lot of unnecessary data created, maintained and supported without human regulatory intelligence. Many valuable resources of hardware, software and including facilitating network infrastructure misused to support unnecessary replicated information. This kind of situation need to be overcome by adopting a new kind of principles and computing technologies. This paper presents next generation web x.0 and its combination of adaptive technology sources to overcome the problems of present social web2.0 and semantic web 3.0. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Service Level Agreement plays vital role in cloud environment for fixing price, performance measurements during and after negotiation. Here, we describe a novel methodology for the SLA life cycle in cloud based on negotiation and demonstrate how it can be used to represent and automate negotiation services and also monitor service acquisition and consumption from the cloud. The SLA life cycle in cloud divided into three phases–Pre-Negotiation, Negotiation and Post-Negotiation. Ontology has been developed for each phase to extract the semantic knowledge. In pre-negotiation, consumer and provider interaction made using SLA registry. In postnegotiation, SLA monitoring, validation and penalty claim sequences are recorded. SLA optimization and re-negotiation are also enabled. This paper aimed to provide web based interaction platform for consumer-provider negotiation using automated and semantic knowledge. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Maintaining security and privacy in the Cloud is a complex task. The task is made even more challenging as the number of vulnerabilities associated with the cloud infrastructure and applications are increasing very rapidly. Understanding the security service level agreements (SSLAs) and privacy policies offered by service and infrastructure providers is critical for consumers to assess the risks of the Cloud before they consider migrating their IT operations to the Cloud. To address these concerns relative to the assessment of security and privacy risks of the Cloud, we have developed ontologies for representing security SLAs (SSLA) in this paper. Our ontologies for SSLAs can be used to understand the security agreements of a provider, to negotiate desired security levels, and to audit the compliance of a provider with respect to federal regulations (such as HIPAA). © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently there is an increasing trend to implement functionalities that allow for the development of applications based on Cloud computing. In education there are high expectations for Learning Management Systems since they can be powerful tools to foster more effective collaboration within a virtual classroom. Tools can also be integrated with these systems that can provide assistance to students on any topic covered in class through the proliferation and popularity of publicly available Web APIs. However, generally most students and teachers still face technological barriers to access these resources and integrate them into their educational systems. This paper discusses an effort to overcome this problem by proposing a method of resource access through linked data, which is explicitly defined with semantic annotations related to the learning environment. Doing so, we are able to decorate the Cloud providers API's, thus providing easy integration into learning applications and important benefits for learning. The effectiveness of our approach has been measured and evaluated through usability methods and cognitive load theory principles. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Public sector institutions nowadays maintain a large amount of data from various domains. This data represents a potential resource that businesses and citizens can use to enhance their own datasets or which can be used to develop new products and public services. Open data support the emergence and realization of the big data potential. While it enhances the volume and velocity of available data, its main impact is on the variety of data sources. This paper deals with the deployment of the Virtual Hadoop for the processing of the open big data idea in the public sector. The first part of this paper is based on the literature review of the cloud computing, the distributed processing of data, big / open / linked data and theirs sources on the web. The primary aim of the Virtual Hadoop deployment is to test the performance efficiency using open big data in order to obtain the direction of the future research. The last part then introduces the most important findings and recommendations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The cloud environment is currently expanding rapidly, from its uses by individuals on standard computer devices to the mobile arena. Service providers for cloud computing are mutually exclusive, but their practices and protocols tend to influence each other, and this is referred to as a hybrid cloud environment. There are many of the types of services, software, and resources used and operated in the hybrid cloud environment, and the differences in defining and formatting data causes various problems in exchanging that data. We are proposing a specific document format for exchanging data as a means to solve the aforementioned issue. In short, we are suggesting the application of mapping techniques from data expression and new standards for document-oriented databases. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ontology matching is among the core techniques used for integration and interoperability resolution between biomedical systems. However, due to the excess usage and ever-evolving nature of biomedical data, ontologies are becoming large-scale, and complex; consequently, requiring scalable computational environments with performance and availability in mind. In this paper, we present a cloud-based ontology matching system for biomedical ontologies that provides ontology matching as a service. Our proposed system implements parallelism at various levels to improve the overall ontology matching performance especially for large-scale biomedical ontologies and incorporates third-party resources UMLS and Wordnet for comprehensive matched results. Matched results are delivered to the service consumer as bridge ontology and preserved in ubiquitous ontology repository for future request. We evaluate our system by consuming the matching service in an interoperability engine of a clinical decision support system (CDSS), which generates mapping requests for FMA and NCI biomedical ontologies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In Location Based Services(LBS), the queries are given by the users and retrieve their locations through tedious search. This process is more time consuming and the user gets confused with the pathway of the router. Android and Cloud Computing can be integrated to reduce the delay. The Android user makes a query to the cloud server and the data can be retrieved on the basis of a Geo tagged query. Here to check off the privacy profile is occurred.Our proposed system is tuned to preserve the privacy of the user‟s location. Three layer of security levels, namely, High, Medium and Low are used in the proposed system. Fuzzy C-mean clustering technique is used for clustering and filtering the query groups. Based on this framework, we propose a data model to increase the precariousness to position data. Also imprecise queries are used to hide the user‟s exact location and this yields probabilistic results. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the advancement in science and technology, the problem of managing and maintaining expensive computing resources have become more complicated. In order to overcome this burden the recent trend is to effectively use cloud computing, supporting resource sharing, with many services. The goal is to aggregate idle network and to preserve resources such as CPU cycles and storage spaces to facilitate effective utilization and computing. For the above mentions, we need to find an efficient method for identifying the services based on all the results from a cloud based search engine. The assignment and choosing of a cloud service should facilitate efficient problem solving and promote optimal use of resources. One such solution must be able to apply in a large array of information processing units. This project proposes to address the above problem using the Multi-Agent Brokering Approach, for the identification of services from the results of a cloud based search engine in a cloud environment. The Multi-Agent Approach ensures that the agents can specialize in identification of services made to process the requests. It also orders the results of the search with various ordering options such as CPU speed, memory and storage. For achieving this, the proper representation of provider capabilities and ontology relationships are essential. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this chapter we discuss the necessity to move beyond builtin monotonic semantic web based reasoning-architectures for endowing ubiquitous robots with cognitive capabilities, which are strongly required in ambient assistive living, towards new architectures that combine different reasoning mechanisms to achieve better context awareness and adaptability in dynamic environments. We also present practical reasoning approaches that we have developed during the last decade for ambient intelligence and robotics applications. Finally, we discuss future directions that should be investigated to implement high-level cognitive capabilities that can be supported by cloud computing platforms as reasoning backend for robots and connected devices in smart spaces. These will enhance the human-environment interaction using robots, emergency prevention, management and rescue. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a domain ontology for cloud archives, based in part on the PREMIS Editorial Committee ontology for the PREMIS Data Dictionary. Our ontology's design is based on a layered model of cloud computing where lower layers provide shared services to higher layers. It focuses on the submission of generic Submission Information Packages with PREMIS preservation metadata. An ontology is designed to define a common vocabulary for cloud archives, and define the roles and responsibilities for data creation and transfer, including the registration of cloud-based content creation systems. We define the classes, object properties, data properties and annotations necessary to describe the agents, objects, events and rights that comprise a cloud archive. We evaluated the ontology with a prototype system, using real-world examples of cloud systems, digital objects and metadata. We found that the ontology was able to describe the chosen components successfully, and that it improved metadata interoperability between content creating applications and the services providing preservation metadata. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the trend of scientific resources getting more important and the resource amount turning to massive, the precision and scalability become key factor of the scientific service system. This study builds the Scientific Service Instant Response System (SSIRS) with the technology of semantic web, cloud computing and parallel processing. For OWL data reasoning, the method which is used to transform scientific datainto OWL data was proposed and the composite suggestion algorithm was achieved. MapReduce programming model was used to process data and the task abstract on multi-core with TBB was done. The experiment result showed that the SSIRS improves the searching efficiency, precision and scalability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the areas involving data relatedness analysis and big data processing (such as information retrieval and data mining) one of common ways to test developed algorithms is to deal with their software implementations. Deploying software as services is one of possible ways to support better access to research algorithms, test collections and third party components as well as their easier distribution. While provisioning software to computing clouds researchers often face difficulties in process of software deployment. Most research software programs utilize different types of unified interface; among them there are many desktop command-line console applications which are unsuitable for execution in networked or distributed environments. This significantly complicates the process of distributing research software via computing clouds. As a part of knowledge driven approach to provisioning CLI software in clouds we introduce a novel subject domain ontology which is purposed to describe and support processes of software building, configuration and execution. We pay special attention to the process of fixing recoverable build and execution errors automatically. We study how ontologies targeting specific build and runtime environments can be defined by using the software provisioning ontology as a conceptual core. We examine how the proposed ontology can be used in order to define knowledge base rules for an expert system controlling the process of provisioning applications to computing clouds and making them accessible as web services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increasing adoption of cloud computing, the enterprise IT environment is progressively transformed into a complex ecosystem of diverse interrelated services typically delivered by a multitude of providers. Such complexity calls for service governance and quality control activities. Ideally, such activities must be performed in a generic and platform-agnostic manner, one which demands an ontology-based approach for the specification and enforcement of the relevant governance policies and the service-level objectives that they entail. At the same time, such governance policies must be expressed in a suitable serialisation format in order to be exposed to the relevant stakeholders and, ultimately, form the basis of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This paper presents an approach for the automatic translation of governance policies expressed in Linked USDL, our chosen ontological framework, into WSAgreement templates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to enhance the quality of the delivered services, dependency avoidance, and operational costs optimization, the multiple-cloud computing emerged. The complexity of multiple-clouds causes a lot of opacity in the definitions and classifications. This paper attempts to provide an accurate definition of the multiple-clouds and, a classification of the available types based on a set of pre-defined criteria. It also outlines the differences between the terms that have been used to refer to the multiple-cloud computing concept. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Innovative approaches for securing the computing systems have intense inference for our understanding of technological, societal, economical, and political phenomena in making guiding principles, policies, rules and security implementations. The model presented here is based on cooperative and collaborative multilateral relationship among the shared business community partners. The sole responsibility for the securing and maintenance of their own virtualized dedicated boxes with jointly hosted data centers distributed geographically is equally, vested with service consumers and vendors. Inspired by multilateral techniques used in army and health care applications, this model is a conceptual and empirical tool aimed, rather depicting a particular set of observed situations or making predictions. It is aimed is to develop our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving the security implementations of existing methods and provide the MCF - multilateral collaborative co-operative framework. This MCF demonstrates an interrelated multilayered virtualized architectural framework for computing utility using virtualization platform. We try to demonstrate qualitatively and empirically the proposed architecture works well for a wide range of workloads and devices belonging to multi tenants with varied security needs. This work is compared with currently existing virtualization platform security framework and avail the novelty of the proposed ontology and framework. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study we introduce a first step to build a Cloud Manufacturing architecture. Cloud Manufacturing is an emerging paradigm in which dynamically scalable and virtualized resources are provided to the users as services over the Internet. Our architecture will serve as a platform for mapping users and manufacturing resources' providers with the aim of enhancing collaboration within Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) by reducing costs and development time. Since some vendors may use different descriptions of their services we believe that semantic web technologies like ontologies are robust tools for mapping vendors' descriptions and users' requests in order to find the suited service. Our ontology is under development and will include concepts from holons, PLM and Cloud Computing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As a new software paradigm, cloud computing provides services dynamically according to user requirements. However, it is difficult to control personal privacy information because of the opening, virtualization, multi-tenancy and service outsourcing characters. Therefore, how to protect user privacy information has become a research focus. In this paper, we propose requirement-oriented privacy protection theory analysis architecture and implementation platform. Firstly, the theory analysis architecture is depicted as layers, and we analyze the function and key technologies of every layer. Secondly, we address the privacy property description method with ontology and description logic, and then analyze the theory modules of privacy items conflict checking layer, privacy policy negotiation layer and privacy agreement forensics layer. Thirdly, according to theory architecture, we design the implementation platform of requirement-oriented privacy protection, and discuss the function and workflow. In the end, we conclude and point out the future work. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - For more than 10 years, research on service descriptions has mainly studied software-based services and provided languages such as WSDL, OWL-S, WSMO for SOAP, and hREST for REST. Nonetheless, recent developments from service management (e.g., ITIL and COBIT) and cloud computing (e.g. Software-as-a-Service) have brought new requirements to service descriptions languages: the need to also model business services and account for the multi-faceted nature of services. Business-orientation, co-creation, pricing, legal aspects, and security issues are all elements which must also be part of service descriptions. While ontologies such as e3service and e3value provided a first modeling attempt to capture a business perspective, concerns on how to contract services and the agreements entailed by a contract also need to be taken into account. This has for the most part been disregarded by the e3 family of ontologies. In this paper, we review the evolution and provide an overview of Linked USDL, a comprehensive language which provides a (multi-faceted) description to enable the commercialization of (business and technical) services over the web. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The management of security policies has become increasingly difficult for the security expert given the number of domains to manage their extent and their complexity. A security expert has to deal with a variety of frameworks, with different language specifications, formalization and aspect used in domains that may belong to any Cloud Computing or Distributed Systems. This wealth of frameworks and languages make the management task and the interpretation of the security policies so hardly difficult. Each approach provides its own conflict management method or tool, the security expert will be forced to manage all these tools, which makes the field maintenance and time consuming expensive. In order to hide this complexity and to facilitate and automate some security expert’s tasks, we propose a security policies aligning based on ontologies process; this process enables to detect and resolve security policies conflicts and to support security experts in managing tasks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Computing Clouds offer a new way of using IT facilities including the hardware, storage, applications and networks. The huge resource pool on the Cloud forms an appropriate platform for running applications with both computing and data intensity, like the DNA sequencing workflows. This paper studies the topic of running scientific workflows on multiple Clouds, with the DNA sequencing workflow as a driven application. We focus on the problem of matching the workflow functional and non-functional Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements to the compute and storage services provisioned by underlying Clouds with different service price and quality. We designed an ontological model for a semantic description of the problem and developed a novel utility-based genetic matching algorithm for selecting the Cloud services with respect to the user requirements and the properties of the Clouds. We validated the approach by comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with other matching algorithms in executing the DNA sequencing application on a realistic simulation platform. The results show the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the total costs and fulfilling the requested service quality even with large-scale service compositions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The spectrum of cloud service providers has become large these days with increasing popularity of cloud computing as a service. These services appear to be similar in their approaches excepting that they vary in their key attributes such as price, computational power, and storage policy. As of now, there are no standardized specifications defined for a cloud service provider. Different cloud service providers use different vocabulary to specify similar operations. A number of quality of service (QoS) parameters may be associated with a service, and thus, identification of the appropriate parameter and its management is the vital issue that needs to be addressed by the service provider. In this context, the search engines such as Google, MSN, etc., do not represent the most effective and most efficient tools in order for determining the appropriate cloud service that could optimally meet the service requirements of a customer. It remains as a challenging issue for a customer requesting for a cloud service. Thus, there arises the necessity of a reasoning mechanism for service discovery that is capable of resolving the similarities among variety of services. In this paper, we address a semantic-based service description and discovery framework using multi-agent approach, where the cloud service descriptions that are automated based on shared ontology, contribute to optimal discovery of appropriate services as requested by consumers. © Springer India 2015. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A healthcare cloud is used by healthcare service providers for storing, maintaining, and backing up personal health information along with structured management of the health data across multiple healthcare providers. On a daily basis, healthcare services deal with different kinds of digital information ranging from structured to unstructured. The widespread adoption of electronic health records have resulted in an improved patient health and safety as well as significant savings in healthcare costs. Moreover, deploying healthcare records over cloud environment will enable access of critical patient's information at any time and from anywhere. But many enterprises are facing a major research challenge due to the unavailability of suitable cloud architecture for design, development, and deployment of healthcare services. In this paper, a flexible architecture for SaaS-based healthcare services has been proposed specifically for healthcare applications, which is capable of semi-structured healthcare data management and storing compatible with Health Level Seven (HL7) standard (Hennessy et al. in A framework and ontology for mobile sensor platforms in home health management, 2013; Liu et al. in iSMART: ontology-based semantic query of CDA documents AMIA annual symposium, pp. 375-379, 2009) [6, 7]. HL7 specifies the structure and semantics of "clinical documents" for the purpose of sharing; therefore, data can be easily shared among the applications. © Springer India 2015. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
