	abstract = {To address data protection concerns, authorities and standards bodies worldwide have released a plethora of regulations, guidelines, and software controls to be applied to Cloud data. As a result, service providers maintaining their end-user's private attributes have seen a surge in compliance requirements. Since most of these regulations are not available in a machine-processable format, it requires significant manual effort to adhere to them. Often many of the laws have overlapping rules, but as they are not referencing each other, providers must duplicate efforts to comply with each regulation. We have done a detailed study of all the data protection regulations that apply to Cloud data. We have developed an integrated, semantically rich knowledge graph that captures these various data compliance regulations. It includes the data threats and security controls that are needed to mitigate the risks. In this paper, we present this knowledge graph in detail, along with the system that we have developed to evaluate it. We have validated our knowledge graph against the privacy policies of various Cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, {IBM}, and Rackspace. This knowledge graph is available in the public domain and can be used by organizations to automate their compliance processes and set their enterprise Cloud security policies.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIFS.2019.2936975},
	abstract = {{IP} prefix hijacking continues to be a pervasive cyber security threat to the core internet routing infrastructure. The data security of multiple cloud-based services is also susceptible to these threats, due to the high dependency on traditional routing protocols. Although a number of hijacking detection techniques have been recently proposed, no existing system has effectively addressed the problem of detecting malicious transit Autonomous System ({AS}) services in any detected hijacking occurrences. The ability to locate and isolate malicious services is critical for conducting a necessary mitigation strategy at an early stage, to minimise the impact of the attack, to restore cloud services quickly. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time processing method, so-called Ontological Graph Identification ({OGI}), for detecting {IP} prefix hijacking of nodes and suspicious transit nodes caused by the hijacked nodes through {ASs}. The proposed method is evaluated using the two public datasets of {RIPE} {RIS} and {RouteView}. Experimental results revealed improved performance for the detection of malicious transit nodes compared with peer techniques. It is, therefore, shown that the proposed method has utility in automating the process of investigating nodes with suspicious activities in real network systems.},

	doi = {10.1109/DataCom.2019.00040},
	abstract = {Cloud computing involves multiple stakeholders, each with its own security, privacy and trust requirements, where policy enforcement is shared between the various stakeholders, in contrast to on-premise computing, where an organizations policies are enforced using internal resources. To effectively manage and integrate security requirements in the cloud, the provider and customer needs to negotiate and agree upon the applied security policies. However, there is no standard way of expressing cloud security policies in a vendor-agnostic manner. Cloud security and privacy policies are often stated in an informal and ad-hoc manner, which leads to policy conflicts, incompleteness, ambiguity and inconsistencies. In this paper, we present {CERBERUS}, a framework for representing cloud security and privacy policies and detecting potential problems in the policies. {CERBERUS} adopts an object-oriented approach and consists of an ontology and notation, policies, guidelines and rules, and a tool for capturing and detecting policy errors. Using {CERBERUS}, policies can be analyzed for potential problems, including policy conflicts, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness. An application of {CERBERUS} shows that it indeed helps to discover policy errors, which otherwise would go undetected or in many cases would be detected a posteriori at runtime.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is witnessing a fast development and widespread adoption from small to large organizations due to its cost-effective and resource-efficient services. Nevertheless, security risks remain major concerns. One of the main challenges is how to evaluate the security level of cloud services. Among the problems arising are the large variety of knowledge associated with the security domain and the heterogeneity of cloud services descriptions. An effective solution to such problems is ontologies. Ontologies provide a more structured and formal representation of a particular domain, which will help to reduce the conceptual ambiguity and enable automatic reasoning functionalities. In this paper, we propose an ontology for cloud services security evaluation based on industry standards and best practices. Some of the core concepts included in the ontology are the target, criteria, yardstick, data gathering techniques and data synthesis approaches. The concepts are grouped into five general categories, namely: context, assumptions, external factors, activities, and outcomes. The ontology is implemented using Protégé tool and validated through different uses case scenarios.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as real world technology over the Internet. Due to the development of big data with high dimensionality, data storage possibility over cloud has created large scope in recent times. Document clustering is the fundamental topic that turned into an indispensable component in many areas like cloud computing. Document clustering partitions the document into significant classes or groups for retrieving the relevant document. Many researchers used the factorization methods and ontologies for internal and external knowledge based document clustering. However, existing methods failed to provide the semantic feature construction and leads to the information loss while covering all the ideas in documents. In order to address these problems, different document clustering techniques in cloud has been reviewed in this paper. In addition to that Document clustering by Entropy-based Boosting with Projection Neural Feature ({EB}-{PNF}) method is presented. The proposed method involves two stages. They are, similar document identification based on semantic similarity score, feature extraction which includes the extraction of both single and multi-label features based on the precision, recall and computational complexity to prove that {EB}-{PNF} method produces high-quality clusters comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Thus, a uniform description of Cloud services would be needed. The aim of this study is to provide a new ontology for uniform description of Cloud services coming from heterogeneous sources. The proposed model takes into account the different relationships and dependencies between services across Cloud's layers. These dependencies are represented by the different constraints of composition and deployment. To validate our proposal, qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted. The qualitative evaluation is carried out by making comparisons with both state-of-the-art works and the Bitnami platform according to some criteria. For the quantitative evaluation, comparisons are performed with the output results specified by users. Globally, the results are promising and encouraging.},

While this "ease" is appealing, several issues arise: 1) Which Cloud Providers ({CPs}) offer the best infrastructure at a fair budget? 2) I am no Cloud expert, then what are the characteristics of the infrastructure which best fit my application? To answer these questions, one must solve a resource management problem, that is, the allocation of computing, storage, networking and (indirectly) cost resources to a set of applications such that the performance objectives of the application are fulfilled. There are many approaches which answer separately these questions but there is no comprehensive and easily usable solution for these issues. {MANeUveR} solves them by integrating the following components: 1) a Web User Interface offers the end user the possibility to describe his application in terms of interactions between components and their software and hardware requirements, 2) an Offers Management System, through a crawler, periodically updates an ontology with infrastructure and services details from different {CPs}, 3) a Recommendation Engine provides a (sub) optimal solution for application deployment in the {CP} infrastructure regarding the leasing price of the virtual machines needed for deployment and their characteristics.

Enterprises and vendors are continuously migrating their services to the Cloud, this resulted an exponential amount of data, services and resources stored in data centers. Since there is no standard about Cloud service description or publication, therefore a key requirement that every Cloud provider needs to take into consideration is efficient management of resources and services by providing automated solutions, for a better service publication and discovery. The proposed approach aims to manage Cloud {SaaS} services for an efficient publication by classifying them into sets according to their domain to reduce the search space then interconnected the {SaaS} services of the same domain in a Semantic Network using the similarity measure (Input/Output similarity) between concepts. The proposed solution takes advantages from multidimensional index framework, {WordNet} Domain Ontology and semantic Web. A guided publication process and an implemented prototype are introduced validating the system using a real data set corpus.},

	abstract = {Semantic Annotation is the main activity for the semantic web, but it has been faced with many challenges which has hindered its growth as initially expected. While several tools exist for providing semantic annotation to web documents, the techniques used in these tools vary very widely. Also, the mode of implementation and the solutions offered by the tools are inconsistent with each other leaving end users confused on the appropriate tool for use to deliver their expected results. Based on these, a holistic perspective to the development of semantic annotation tools as well as their implementation is necessary. This is to ensure uniformity in the expected end results and guarantee a continuous, dynamic and consistent semantic annotation for web documents; encompassing the complete needs of end users. To achieve this, cloud computing is proposed for the delivery of semantic annotation as a holistic service, as it provides an enabling environment for processing the vast amount of data required to annotate web documents. Also, cloud computing essential characteristics such as ubiquitous network access, rapid elasticity and on-demand self-service are very necessary to achieve a holistic semantic annotation service for documents on the web. This paper presents a cloud-driven framework to facilitate the delivery of a holistic semantic annotation on the web.},

The proposed system provides enhanced, flexible access control while minimizing the overhead of altering the existing access control framework. We also discuss various use cases, to highlight the benefits of our system and show enforcement results.},

	abstract = {Medical organizations find it challenging to adopt cloud-based electronic medical records services, due to the risk of data breaches and the resulting compromise of patient data. Existing authorization models follow a patient centric approach for {EHR} management where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients' end. This however creates a significant overhead for the patient who has to authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given the multiple personnel involved in providing care and that at times the patient may not be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need of developing a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy cloud-based {EHR} management. We have developed a novel, centralized, attribute based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption ({ABE}) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based {EHR}'s access authority to the medical providers. In this paper, we describe this novel {ABE} approach as well as the prototype system that we have created to illustrate it.},

For this purpose, we developed {SAM} - the Semantic-aware Middleware - and the {SAM} Store. The latter resembles a registry. It allows component providers to publish semantically enriched interfaces and to offer corresponding local and remote implementations. {SAM} makes use of the {SAM} Store to match local interprocess communication ({IPC}) messages transparently against local and remote components. This architecture facilitates the integration of powerful, but resource-intensive remote components, which may be prioritized over local ones, and fosters various patterns of cooperation that demonstrate useful solutions in the area of {MCC}.

Semantics of services from different venders may be described by distributed domain ontologies. Distributed knowledge brings difficulty to competition and cooperation among services, and hampers the evolution of a service ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a distributed knowledge based evolution model ({DKEM}) to promote competition and cooperation among services from different venders. {DKEM} considers stability as key factor in competition, and a stability evaluation model is designed to compute stability of services, venders, and service-based processes according to service invocation histories. Based on the evaluation model, two evolution patterns are given, and they can automatically explore new and more stable cooperation among services by means of runtime self-adaption mechanism. A prototype system for {DKEM} is implemented and a series of experiments show that {DKEM} is effective for competition and cooperation among services with distributed knowledge, and, evolved processes have higher stability and response efficiency.},

	abstract = {In today's era of digitization, due to the improper structuring of huge data available from various sources leading to poor interlinking of data, the web is not being utilized to its full potential. So, there is a need for re-establishing the structures of openly published data on the web by giving various specifications or frameworks of data published in cyberspace. With the aim of better utilization of web data and transition from keyword-based search to contextual search, the Semantic web has emerged as a key milestone. In this direction, Tim Berners Lee has proposed the conventions namely {RDF} and {SPARQL} for linking and querying the machine-processable shared data on the web and also a 5-star linked data scheme to distinguish the type of data on web based on its linking properties. This paper presents a Framework for Linking and querying open datasets on government portals, embedding semantics in the data by {RDF} alignment using state-of-art tools such as {OpenRefine} and Twinkle tool. The 5-Star scheme has been discussed and practical demonstration of enriching data is given. This clearly puts forward the transition from web of documents to web of data. This paper also presents the framework for translating the data in datasets to the graph based {RDF} data in Triple format. This translated data is then queried using standard {SPARQL} Queries showcasing the linked data fetched in tuple format. The data-graph of the resultant linked data is also presented.},

In this work we propose an automatic classification and modelling of requirements that are expressed in a natural language form, and an automatic identification of cloud services categories from requirements in order to support the development of a cloud application. Automated requirements analysis is not an easy subject, due to the natural languages variability and ambiguity, that's why different machine/deep learning and natural language processing approaches are used and compared.

While the current workflow management systems implement mostly different complicated graphical tasks based on advanced distributed solutions (e.g., cloud computing and grid computation), workflow knowledge acquisition from texts using case-based reasoning represents more expressive and semantic case representations. We propose in this context, an ontology-based workflow extraction framework to acquire processual knowledge from texts. Our methodology extends the classic {NLP} techniques to extract and disambiguate complex tasks and relations in texts. Using a graph-based representation of workflows and a domain ontology, our extraction process uses a context-aware approach to recognize workflow components in texts: data and control flows. We applied our framework in a technical domain in bioinformatics: i.e., phylogenetic analyses. An evaluation based on workflow semantic similarities in a gold standard proves that our approach provides promising results in the process extraction domain.

Among the many changes in data processing and service provision paradigms, Software as a Service ({SaaS}) and collaborative editing are two of the most significant. This paper presents an approach based on semantic publish/subscribe paradigm to the development of collaborative editing applications. The main aim of this research work consists in exploiting emerging technologies (i.e. semantic web data representation formalisms, publish-subscribe platforms) in order to (1) overcome limitations coming from the traditional paradigm of single-author workflows, (2) enhance the editing capabilities of the users, (3) ease the development and maintainment of applications and (4) provide a shared high- level abstraction of the documents that fosters information-level interoperability and reusability. The proposed approach is then validated through an ad-hoc vector graphics application, {SCEd} (Semantic Collaborative Editor) built upon a {SPARQL} Event Processing Architecture derived from the Smart-M3 semantic publish-subscribe platform.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the problem of implementing the Data Fabric architecture as a technology for sustainable data processing and storage for the modernization of industrial platforms in transport and road systems. To perform complex tasks like monitoring road transport facilities entails huge resources for storing interactive data online. The concept of transport enterprises moving to cloud systems opens up gaps in data management in hybrid and multi-cloud systems. To solve such problems, the implementation of the Data Fabric structure allows you to integrate data and metadata for use on various platforms. The sustainable development of such platforms is facilitated by the use of the Data Fabric mechanism as a built-in system for standardization and coding, the implementation of semantic compatibility, proprietary knowledge graphs and the domain of data values of the transport industry. Data Fabric helps organizations solve complex data problems and use cases by managing their data regardless of application types, platforms, and storage locations, while ensuring seamless data access and sharing in a distributed data environment. The article analyzes the stability of the Data Fabric platform as a domain-oriented decomposition model based on a distributed data architecture with centralized management, but not as a fragmented data warehouse. Using the example of such a decomposition, it is necessary to model an architecture that organizes analytical and other data by areas. In this architecture, the domain's interface with the rest of the organization includes not only operational capabilities, but also access to the analytical data that the domain serves to scale the system.},

Our ultimate goal is to promote information therapy (Ix) as it aims to prescribe the right information to right people at right time. In our solution, Ix is carried out by a {SPARQL} engine, which is capable for accessing {PHRs} and other medical data sources within a query. Thus we can augment patient's data in {PHR} by external data sources. Such automatic augmentation is based on the overlapping ontologies that model {PHRs}' data as well the data in public medical data sources.},

In this article, we conduct pioneering research on authenticated queries for graph data, which is a popular data type such as the knowledge graph data, on the blockchain-assisted cloud. The primary challenge is how to design an authenticated data structure ({ADS}) that supports authenticated queries and can be easily maintained by the blockchain. To this end, we propose a novel {ADS}, named {PAGB}, based on the {RSA} accumulator and completeness set. It can also prevent the original data from being revealed to the public through blockchain or irrelevant queries. We further optimize our design to be more efficient in terms of communication and computation. The effectiveness and efficiency of {PAGB} are verified through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.},

However, the existing {RDF} database engines are not scalable and are less reliable in heterogeneous clouds. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Acacia-{RDF} which is a scalable distributed {RDF} graph database engine developed with X10 programming language to solve this issue. Acacia-{RDF} partitions the {RDF} data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable {SPARQL} processor for Acacia-{RDF} which operates on top of partitioned {RDF} data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the implementation of scalable graph algorithms such as Triangle counting with such partitioned data sets. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of {LUBM} {RDF} benchmark data sets and make a comparison of Acacia's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-{RDF} scales well with {LUBM} data sets. Acacia-{RDF} reported approximately 2 seconds elapsed time on 4 places for running the first and third queries of the {LUBM} benchmark on {LUBM} scale 40 data set. Through this work we introduce the use of X10 language for scalable {RDF} graph data management.},

Analysis of monitoring data delivers insights of the system's workload and usage pattern and ensures workloads are operating at optimum levels. The analysis process involves data query and extraction, data analysis, and result visualization. Since the volume of monitoring data is big, these operations require a scalable and reliable architecture to extract, aggregate, and analyze data in an arbitrary range of granularity. Ultimately, the results of analysis become the knowledge of the system and should be shared and communicated. This paper presents our cloud service architecture that explores a search cluster for data indexing and query. We develop {REST} {APIs} that the data can be accessed by different analysis modules. This architecture enables extensions to integrate with software frameworks of both batch processing (such as Hadoop) and stream processing (such as Spark) of big data. The analysis results are structured in Semantic Media Wiki pages in the context of the monitoring data source and the analysis process. This cloud architecture is empirically assessed to evaluate its responsiveness when processing a large set of data records under node failures.},

However, most existing works on encrypted search over outsourced cloud data follow the model of “one size fits all” and ignore personalized search intention. Moreover, most of them support only exact keyword search, which greatly affects data usability and user experience. So how to design a searchable encryption scheme that supports personalized search and improves user search experience remains a very challenging task. In this paper, for the first time, we study and solve the problem of personalized multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data ({PRSE}) while preserving privacy in cloud computing. With the help of semantic ontology {WordNet}, we build a user interest model for individual user by analyzing the user's search history, and adopt a scoring mechanism to express user interest smartly. To address the limitations of the model of “one size fit all” and keyword exact search, we propose two {PRSE} schemes for different search intentions. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate our analysis and show that our proposed solution is very efficient and effective.},

To consider hierarchies or subsume relationships among them, {eHeaRSS} Ontology ({eHeaRSS}-Ont) is developed through integration of 4-static ontology (4-Ont) which is comprised of symptom-, disease-, department-and doctor-Ont to create tailored recommendations depending on patient-context. For the recommendation service, Case-based reasoning ({CBR}) is applied. The extracted cases using 4-Ont are integrated by {eHeaRSS}-Ont depending on the patient-context. For customization, it is necessary to reconfigure the case using {eHeaRSS} Constraints Value Compatibility Map ({eHeaRSS}-{CVCM}). To prove the significance and efficiency of the {eHeaRSS}, we experimented using ontology-based data processing and proved the superiority of {eHeaRSS} with the provision of better recommendation than other {DB}-based systems.},

In medical domains, the current privacy preserving methods either use the technology of Access Control List, or need to prepare training documents for each privacy policy. However, it is a time-consuming and impractical way for data owners to assign a privacy policy on each document. In this paper, by exploiting the privacy medical queries, we propose a novel approach based on semantic and ontology to achieve the topic-level privacy preserving search. With the support of them, we first mine all the potential hierarchy and semantics from a user query and acquire sensitive terms relative to privacy policies automatically without training documents.},

	doi = {10.1109/UCC.2015.105},
	abstract = {The term "trust" in the area of cloud computing has always been one of the most problematic issues. The cloud user becomes willing to accept insecure conditions and unconsciously increases these conditions' security level if he is able to find a strategy that provides trust. This level of trust, once established, is difficult to maintain if any deception takes place. The indications of proven trust can only be seen in future usage of a cloud service. For this reason, specific control instruments are required to ascertain the accuracy of one's trust. The establishment of trust in a public cloud environment requires a paradigm change: a holistic strategy that enforces regulation requirements throughout the cloud architecture. The movement of the root of trust into hardware reduces vulnerability to compromise, as hardware attacks require a high expenditure of time and effort. Cloud users would define regulation standards through trust-worthy {IT} instruments and enforce them in specific cloud-service layers. The extension of this approach is the regulation of {SaaS}-based applications to enforce requirements for separation and availability. This work introduces a conceptual approach to establish a chain of policy by using hardware-oriented root of trust. The conceptual description of a chain of policy outlines the main principles to enforce regulations accurately for each architectural cloud layer based on an established chain of trust.},

So that all objects in the domain can recognize and understand the concept of ontology description, so as to realize the sharing of the knowledge information in the ontology domain.

The authors emphasize that in addition to this, there is a clear trend towards personalized medicine, which will be most effective when using cloud technologies. It is noted that medical organizations mainly use information systems that ensure the transfer of financial, operational and personnel applications to the cloud. With the advent of new digital services, there is also an increasing need for cloud transformation of key medical systems and applications to improve the quality of patient care. The article discusses aspects of the implementation of cloud infrastructure solutions in the process of automating various clinical areas. It highlights the need for integrated healthcare solutions including medical imaging and emergency medical care. The possibility of combining applications, servers and databases used by various organizations (health authorities, medical organizations, research centers, etc.) into a common network using modern cloud platform solutions is noted. The aspects of standardization of medical information systems and the use of standard products, including ontologies, are noted. The task of the near future is the development of cloud solutions in the intelligent assistant to the doctor, including the introduction of integrated clinical applications, automatic quality control of medical care and other areas. The possibility of developing universal interfaces for integrated clinical applications is being considered. This is especially important in emergency situations.},

This can be recommended to end-users in the Service Level Agreement ({SLA}) under Web Service Modeling Ontology ({WSMO}) of {WS}-Policy. Generally, the matrix of collected {QoS} parameter values is sparse and the accurate prediction of the missing {QoS} values is important for the recommendation of appropriate web services to the end users.

One of the major benefits of using {EHR} systems is assisting physicians to gain patients' healthcare information and shorten the process of the medical decision making. However, physicians' inputs still have a great impact on making decisions that cannot be checked by {EHR} systems. This consequence can be influenced by human behaviors or physicians' knowledge structures. An efficient approach of alerting to the unusual decisions is an urgent requirement for current {EHR} systems. This paper proposes a schema using ontology in big data to generate an alerting mechanism to assist physicians to make a proper medical diagnosis. The proposed model is Ontology-based {EHR} Error Prevention Model ({OEHR}-{EPM}), which is implemented by a proposed algorithm, Error Prevention Adjustment Algorithm ({EPAA}). The ontological approach uses Protege to represent the knowledge-based ontology.

	abstract = {Despite its attractive benefits, cloud adoption is challenged by some criteria of security and privacy. Access Control is one of the traditional and essential security tools of data protection. The decision to grant access to a resource must ensure secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In particular, the challenge is more important with public clouds as many governing authorities could be involved in one cloud scenario. This implies a difficulty to work out which regulation should be applicable in case of conflict. In recent years, many access control models were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their security policies specification and enforcement. In this paper, we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies for the context of public cloud. Throughout the use of ontology tools, we propose an approach for checking privacy enforcement with access control conditions. We also suggest the use of privacy safeguards notification where the threat to privacy protection is related to the secondary usage of personal data more than just the data access itself.},

Existing methods have either scalability issues by requiring that patients grant access to their medical data or a trust issue by having a single authority, thereby creating the problem of a single point of attack. Hence there is a need to develop an {EHR} system that addresses these bottlenecks for safe, secure, and easy cloud-based {EHR} management. To address these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that allows policy-based multi-authority access permission to Electronic Health Record systems used by multiple care providers from various places or organizations. This framework, residing on the Edge, has been built using the Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption ({MA}-{ABE}) and Semantic Web technologies to provide a safe, semantically rich approach to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations who manage different attributes of end-users using a shared dataset.

	abstract = {Over the past few years, cloud computing has been more and more attractive as a new computing paradigm due to high flexibility for provisioning on-demand computing resources that are used as services through the Internet. In cloud computing, the unique characteristics in cloud services such as dynamic and diverse services offered at different levels, together with the lack of standardized description languages pose significant challenges for effective cloud service discovery. In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service categories to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching in real environments. Our approach has the capability to automatically identify and categorize cloud services by detecting cloud service concepts from cloud service sources. Initially, we focus on building the cloud service ontology by using {NIST} ({US} National Institute of Standards and Technology). Then, we utilize our cloud service categorization method to investigate cloud service ontology's concepts in a real-world cloud services dataset which contains the metadata of 5,883 real cloud services. After that, we generate cloud service clusters by using cosine similarity to build the cloud service categorization. Our cloud service categorization is helpful in determining whether a given web source is a cloud service. Furthermore, the new web resource which has been categorized as a cloud service can be used to boost knowledge of cloud service categorization cumulatively. The proposed approach is validated by using real-world cloud services available on the World Wide Web and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in cloud service discovery.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth in biological sequence data is revolutionizing our understanding of genotypic diversity and challenging conventional approaches to informatics. With the increasing availability of genomic data, traditional bioinformatic tools require substantial computational time and the creation of ever-larger indices each time a researcher seeks to gain insight from the data. To address these challenges, we pre-computed important relationships between biological entities spanning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and captured this information in a relational database. The database can be queried across hundreds of millions of entities and returns results in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. In this paper, we describe Functional Genomics Platform (formerly known as {OMXWare}), a comprehensive database relating genotype to phenotype for bacterial life. Continually updated, the Functional Genomics Platform today contains data derived from 200,000 curated, self-consistently assembled genomes. The database stores functional data for over 68 million genes, 52 million proteins, and 239 million domains with associated biological activity annotations from Gene Ontology, {KEGG}, {MetaCyc}, and Reactome. The Functional Genomics Platform maps all of the many-to-many connections between each biological entity including the originating genome, gene, protein, and protein domain. Various microbial studies, from infectious disease to environmental health, can benefit from the rich data and connections. We describe the data selection, the pipeline to create and update the Functional Genomics Platform, and the developer tools (Python {SDK} and {REST} {APIs})which allow researchers to efficiently study microbial life at scale.},

Providers of Cloud Computing services for Data Mining publish the descriptions and definitions in many formats and often not compatible with other providers. From a functional point of view, having the possibility to describe complete Data Mining services is fundamental to maintain the usability and especially the portability of these services independently of the software/hardware support or even the differences between cloud platforms. The main objective of this article is to design a Data Mining service definition which allows to compose with a single and simple definition a complete service, in such way a data mining workflow can be ported and deployed in different providers or even in a Market Place of this type of ready-to-consume services. This article presents a semantic scheme for the definition and description of complete Data Mining services considering both the management of the service by the provider (price, authentication, Service Level Agreement, ...) and the definition of the Data Mining workflow as a service. It represents a solid contribution for paving the way to the standardization and industrialization of Data Mining services. To asses the validity of the scheme a list of services from Data Mining providers have been described and an example of a full service for a Random Forest algorithm has been defined as a service. In addition, a practical scenario has been developed, creating a deployment platform for Data Mining services to give functional support to the scheme, illustrating the practical benefits of the proposal for the end user.},

To gain economic benefits, some {SaaS} service providers have not been authorized to collect and analyze the user's sensitive private data, as a result, the user's private data is disclosed. In this paper, we propose a private data chain disclosure discovery method, to prevent a user's sensitive privacy information from being illegally disclosed. First, we measure the similarity degree and cost of the disclosure of the private data. Second, according to the similarity degree and cost of disclosure, the disclosure chain and key private data are detected in the process of interaction between user and {SaaS} service. Third, we propose a discovery framework for the private data chain and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness by experiments.},

This new big data-centric service model aims to provide customer-oriented massive services by combining both physical and virtualized resources from different domains. Although such complex ecosystem is able to process, encapsulate and offer huge volumes of data as services, its management operations are beyond the ability of human administrators, due to several challenges including the big services’ large-scale nature and complexity, the heterogeneity of their components (e.g., services, data sources, connected things), the dynamicity and uncertainty of their hosting cloud environments. To cope with the lack of understanding regarding big services capabilities, we propose to describe them using a novel meta-model for the quality of big services ({QoBS}). We also take advantage of a recent technology called knowledge graphs, to represent the big service information (service descriptions, services’ and data sources’ quality levels, management policies) as a heterogeneous information network. Finally, a multi-view representation learning approach is proposed to infer additional knowledge regarding big services capabilities.},

	abstract = {Scientists gain benefits from scalable resource provisioning on-demand, and various computing environments by using cloud computing resources for their applications. However, many cloud computing providers offer their cloud resources according to their own rules. The descriptions of various cloud resources also differ for each vendor. Subsequently, it becomes difficult to find suitable cloud resources given the characteristics of an application. Scientists therefore, select resources used in previous experiments or best performance resources without considering the characteristics of their applications. There is the need to standardize notations to support simple selection of cloud resources without the constraints of providers. Intercloud can use cloud resources without considering cloud providers in hybrid cloud environments. Intercloud project has been studied for interoperability and creates {mOSAIC} ontology to conceptualize various resources. However, the {mOSAIC} ontology attributes are limited when considering characteristics of an application. We propose a semantic engine to provide semantic cloud resource services in intercloud environment. We define a rule of categorized resource description with reference to {mOSAIC} ontology attributes which includes added factors needed to represent application characteristics. We also develop a semantic engine which can choose semantically similar cloud resources using statistical analysis while considering the characteristics of an application. The semantic engine can also classify resources dynamically according to application specifications.},

The system also includes searchable encryption using keyword index and search trapdoor, which allows querying {EHR} fields without decrypting the entire patient record. The attribute revocation feature is efficiently managed in our {EHR} by delegating the revision of the secret key and ciphertext to the Cloud Service Provider ({CSP}). Our methodology incorporates advanced security features that eliminate malicious use of {EHR} data and contributes significantly towards ensuring secure digital health systems on the Cloud.},

Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology.},

However, today's {BPaaS} solutions lack an explicit and formal semantics which prevent an easy and dynamic interoperability between different cloud providers. In this paper, we propose firstly to semantically populate a shared knowledge base of process models deployed by {BPaaS} providers. Therefore, using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve similar process fragments that can be used to design new process variants. We also performed experiments on large public datasets and experimental results show that our approach is feasible and efficient.},

First, the evolution of business model in cloud environment is developed. Second, by analyzing business model innovations on business model nine building blocks in cloud environment, the element of service-centric business model is defined. Then, an ontological framework which includes value, service, and business model dimension for service-centric innovative business model is proposed.

	abstract = {In the contemporary cloud computing environment, the various cloud providers adopt different architectures for their systems and usually these are not compatible. The scalable exchange of information about these heterogeneous resources is often not addressed; still this represents an interesting challenge, since different Cloud systems and vendors have different ways to describe and invoke their services, to specify and communicate requirements. Hence a way to provide a common access to Cloud services and to discover and use required services in Cloud federations is highly desirable. The {IEEE} P2302 Intercloud approach is to define a scalable architecture and to adopt the {OMN} (Open-Multinet) ontology for supporting its operation. Our work specifically describes the inner workings of the Intercloud system in terms of the Intercloud Federation Application Programmers Interface ({API}), which are in turn based on the semantic definition of resources, Service Level Agreements ({SLAs}), and Bearer Network Provisioning Metadata.},

The main idea is that all Cloud components offer their functions as a service. For this reason Cloud systems inherits many features from old Web Services and Service Oriented architectures. At the moment, the need for composition and automation of Cloud services is a hot research field. Orchestration is one of the topics that researchers are investigating. Unlike web services, it is not clear what orchestration means in Cloud Systems. It usually addresses automation, but no clear definitions and languages have been provided. Another hot topic regarding composition of cloud services is the definition of design, architectural and communication Patterns for solving well known and common problems. In this work we will show how Orchestration and some Patterns are tightly coupled. We will describe a methodology for definition of orchestrated workflows which exploits some common Cloud Design Patterns in order to verify composition soundness. In addition we will show how this methodology can be used to verify some requirements on the composed Cloud services. The whole methodology is based both on formal semantics definition of an Orchestration language, and on the use of Ontologies for the description of Cloud services interactions.},

Existing authorization models follow a patient-centric approach for {EHR} management, where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients end. This creates a significant overhead for the patient who must authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given that multiple personnel are typically involved in providing care and that the patient may not always be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need to develop a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy to use cloud-based {EHR} Service management. We present a novel, centralized, attribute-based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption ({ABE}) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based {EHRs} access authority to medical providers.},

	abstract = {Keyword search over encrypted data is essential for accessing outsourced sensitive data in cloud computing. In some circumstances, the keywords that the user searches on are only semantically related to the data rather than via an exact or fuzzy match. Hence, semantic-based keyword search over encrypted cloud data becomes of paramount importance. However, existing schemes usually depend upon a global dictionary, which not only affects the accuracy of search results but also causes inefficiency in data updating. Additionally, although compound keyword search is common in practice, the existing approaches only process them as single words, which split the original semantics and achieve low accuracy. To address these limitations, we initially propose a compound concept semantic similarity ({CCSS}) calculation method to measure the semantic similarity between compound concepts. Next, by integrating {CCSS} with Locality-Sensitive Hashing function and the secure kk{\textless}; inline-graphic xlink:href="wang-ieq1-2847318.gif"/{\textgreater}-Nearest Neighbor scheme, a semantic-based compound keyword search ({SCKS}) scheme is proposed. {SCKS} achieves not only semantic-based search but also multi-keyword search and ranked keyword search. Additionally, {SCKS} also eliminates the predefined global library and can efficiently support data update. The experimental results on real-world dataset indicate that {SCKS} introduces low overhead on computation and the search accuracy outperforms the existing schemes.},

So, vendor lock-in problem appeared. One solution to this problem is to use generic {APIs} with specific adapters. However, any update in a {PaaS} specific-{API} makes its corresponding adapter is unusable which causes, what we call, {API} synchronization problem. Therefore, {STAGER} ({SemanTic}-based {GenERation} of Generic-{API} Adapters) framework is proposed. {STAGER} framework provides a semi-automatic adapter generation process, which generates specific adapters of generic {APIs} for {PaaS} services (e.g., blob storage and datastore services) for target {PaaS} platforms. The adapter generation process is based on semantic annotations of the generic {APIs} and their corresponding {PaaS} specific-{APIs}. In order to evaluate {STAGER} framework, two generic {APIs} for blob storage and {NoSQL} datastore services have been proposed. {STAGER} framework is used to generate the adapters of these generic {APIs} for two {PaaS} platforms: Google App Engine ({GAE}) and Windows Azure. Although there is some overhead for semantically annotating the {PaaS} {APIs}, the evaluation results prove the feasibility of {STAGER} framework and promote the usage of the generated adapters for implementing portable cloud applications.},

	abstract = {Advances in the field of cloud computing and networking have led to rapid development and market growth in areas such as online retail, gaming and healthcare. In the field of advanced manufacturing however, the impact has been significantly lesser than expected due to limitations in cloud platforms for fostering community engagement. To address this problem, we study a new cloud-based architecture that provides Platform-asa-Service ({PaaS}) management capabilities to the manufacturing community for delivering Software-as-a-Service ({SaaS}) “Apps” to their customers. Our architecture aims at supporting an “App Marketplace” that thrives on agile development, organic collaboration and scalable sales of next generation manufacturing Apps requiring high-performance simulation and modeling. Towards realizing the vision of the above architecture, our paper involves investigation and implementation of an Ontology Service that interoperates with other common web services related to resource brokering and accounting. Our Ontology Service uses principles of mapping and merging to translate a manufacturing App's collaboration requirements to suitable resource specifications on public cloud platforms. Integrated resultant ontology can be queried to provision the required resource parameters such as amount of memory/storage, number of processing units, and network protocol configurations needed for deployment of an App. We validate the effectiveness of our Ontology Service using the Protégé framework in a pilot testbed of a real-world “{WheelSim}” App in the {NSF} {GENI} Cloud platform. Our ontology integration results show benefits to an App developer in terms of: optimal user experience, lower design time and lower cost/simulation.},

To achieve this, a set of requirements towards holistic semantic annotation on the web is defined and mapped with cloud computing mechanisms to facilitate them. Technical specification for the requirements is critically reviewed and examined against each of the cloud computing mechanisms, in relation to their technical functionalities. Hence, a mapping is established if the cloud computing mechanism’s functionalities proffer a solution for implementation of a requirement’s technical specification. The result is a cloud computing capability model for holistic semantic annotation which presents an approach towards delivering large-scale semantic annotation on the web via a cloud platform.},

	abstract = {Cloud-based electronic health records ({EHR}) systems provide important security controls by encrypting patient data. However, these records cannot be queried without decrypting the entire record. This incurs a huge amount of burden in network bandwidth and the client-side computation. As the volume of cloud-based {EHRs} reaches Big Data levels, it is essential to search over these encrypted patient records without decrypting them to ensure that the medical caregivers can efficiently access the {EHRs}. This is especially critical if the caregivers have access to only certain sections of the patient {EHR} and should not decrypt the whole record. In this paper, we present our novel approach that facilitates searchable encryption of large {EHR} systems using Attribute-based Encryption ({ABE}) and multi-keyword search techniques. Our framework outsources key search features to the cloud side. This way, our system can perform keyword searches on encrypted data with significantly reduced costs of network bandwidth and client-side computation.},

	abstract = {By embracing the cloud computing paradigm for storing and processing electronic medical records ({EMRs}), modern healthcare providers are able to realise significant cost savings. However, relinquishing control of sensitive medical data by delegating their storage and processing to third-party cloud providers naturally raises significant security concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise appropriate policies that infuse adequate access controls in cloud services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of these services, coupled with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinder the formulation of effective and interoperable policies that are appropriate for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work adopts the ontological templates proposed in [5] for the representation of access control policies in the medical sector. By capturing the knowledge that must be infused into an access control policy, these templates sufficiently address the needs of the underlying domain of application in which such a policy is to be enforced; at the same time, they facilitate developers in infusing adequate access controls to their cloud applications.},

Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering ({CBSE}) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily. The application of Asclepios is wide ranging - from military to Government through to medical and tourism and pharmaceuticals. Further, Asclepios-like applications are very much needed in most Third world countries, including all countries in Africa, as it can significantly enhance the health, safety and well-being of people.},

This task gets more and more difficult to the consumers as they use services from multiple providers, each with its own monitoring policies. In order to implicitly help the consumer monitor the {SLA} and detect violations, it is necessary to implement some advanced {SLA} management strategies. Ontological representation and reasoning techniques in {SLA} management may be beneficial to the evaluation of the {QoS}. In this regard, we propose a monitoring approach with a new semantic {SLA} modeling for cloud computing. Our approach aims to help cloud consumers monitor the {SLA} documents and detect violations by considering the semantic meaning of {SLA} concepts and taking profit from the power of reasoning techniques. This maintains a reliable {QoS} and respects the {SLA} parameters. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in this paper through a simulation and a case study.},

Therefore, provider selection is an important but currently not well supported step for companies trying to benefit from the technology. Influenced by the diversity of service offerings and the absence of applied standards this is a tedious task, especially for ensuring application portability. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria selection approach for cloud platforms based on a field-tested ontology and a comprehensive data set. The methodology is enhanced by semantic algorithms and mappings to reduce hidden query and data biases. This allows not only the exact matching of requirements but also the evaluation of possible alternatives that can be adapted to fit the defined requirements.

In this paper, we propose a semantically rich access control system that employs an access broker module to evaluate access decisions based on rules generated using the organizations confidentiality policies. The proposed system analyzes the multi-valued attributes of the user making the request and the requested document that is stored on a cloud service platform, before making an access decision. Furthermore, our system guarantees an end-to-end oblivious data transaction between the organization and the cloud service provider using oblivious storage techniques. Thus, an organization can use our system to secure their documents as well as obscure their access pattern details from an untrusted cloud service provider.},

	abstract = {The considerable increase in the use of cloud computing and big data solutions requires the use of advanced technologies to ensure data security, privacy and dependability. One of the possible solutions is the use of data anonymization techniques, which performs an important role in data privacy protection. There are several techniques and algorithms to implement data anonymization. However, specifications and guidelines to guide and standardize the use of these resources are needed. These guidelines, called anonymization policies, are considered an important asset in organizations that want to protect their customer personal data. Although the use of data anonymization brings great benefits, there are no clear directions for data anonymization policies, which ends up limiting its adoption by companies and organizations. This work presents a generic anonymization policy to be used in cloud and big data platforms. It also presents a draft ontology with explicit formal specifications for data anonymization policies. This ontology has three main intentions: (i) to standardize the use of data anonymization policies; (ii) share common understanding of the structure of data anonymization among people; (iii) enable reuse of data anonymization policies. In this work, an ongoing study case within the {EUBra}-{BIGSEA} project will be implemented.},

To ensure data confidentiality and fine-grained access control in cloud-based environments, stored data and resources needs to be re-encrypted periodically or based on special mechanisms such as revoked user-based or manual re-encryption. Managing the process of re-encryption is a challenging issue that involves many limitations such as time management, resource confidentiality, and level of access. Accordingly, a multi-level re-encryption model based on policy management has been presented in this paper to ensure data security in clouds. The proposed model uses a policy-based ontology to generate, manage and apply re-encryption policies based on the characteristics of resources, sensitivity of data and capabilities of service provider. The results of comprehensive performance and security analysis of proposed model shows this model increases the reliability of re-encryption processes in cloud storages considerably and provides an efficient policy management for re-encryption tasks.},

The ontology creates links between the characteristics of pregnant women, medical history, disease and possible problems that may occur during pregnancy. The ontology is used in an application stored in cloud to be accessed by physicians from different locations. Based on this information the application creates women profiles matching the risk they may be exposed to. The application is in tests in Bega Hospital.

However, currently, the {CABAN} paradigm in the healthcare domain is facing increasing difficulty in handling the huge amount of sensor data that the body sensor devices generate from diverse Smart home applications. Therefore, the challenging is now timely storing, processing, and analyzing of the sensor data in real time to maintain the Quality of Service ({QoS}) requirements of the caregivers or Smart home applications. {QoS}, here, is the capacity to support diverse Smart home applications in healthcare with different priorities, performance, and resource requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast and robust cloud resource allocation model for body sensor devices to ensure {QoS} for Smart home healthcare applications. We develop the proposed resource allocation algorithm using agent-based modeling ({ABM}) and ontology. There are few works, which consider {ABM} and ontology for resource allocation in {CABAN} platform.

This paper deals with cloud computing security management.

	abstract = {Cloud software deployment, resource provisioning, monitoring and full cycle maintenance has proven to be time-consuming and complicated. While one cloud provider is good at one or a few services, other providers might be good at other services. Cloud users eventually want to consume most advantageous resources across multiple providers with the best price while avoiding vendor lock-in. Cloud users also need to safeguard their most valuable digital asset, their data, against cloud outage, which can happen to any vendor. This could mean using the same type of resources across multiple cloud providers. Moreover, cloud providers are continuously changing and evolving their services. Cloud users can only take advantage of these changes if they are able to relocate and real-locate resources using an autonomous and vendor independent tool. We propose a vendor-independent cloud provisioning tool that utilizes an ontology-based semantic reasoning to acquire the best feasible cloud resources for cloud users. In this paper, we outline an ontology subset for purchasing cloud resources or services based on price, user transaction volume, preference, quality of service and Service Layer Agreements ({SLA}). The proposed ontology is outlined in a case scenario followed by an applied algorithm for negotiating resource purchase between cloud consumer client and cloud vendor provisioning services. Such ontology can be used in inter-cloud federation {API} for monitoring and acquiring and maintaining the most advantageous cloud resources.},

So, we conceptually propose this ally architecture which consists of multi-layer with multi-lateral co-operative multi-factor balanced security framework with common business interests along with shared responsibility among the stakeholders.

This model is part of the Linked {USDL} family of ontologies that can describe not only technical but also business related aspects of services, incorporating Web principles. We validate our proposal by describing agreements in computational and non-computational scenarios, namely cloud computing and business process outsourcing services. Moreover, we evaluate the actual coverage and expressiveness of Linked {USDL} Agreement comparing it with existing models. In order to foster its adoption and effectively manage the service level agreement lifecycle, we present an implemented tool that supports creation, automatic analysis, and publication on the Web of agreement descriptions.},

This leads users to a loos of control over their data and raises reasonable security concerns that slow down the adoption of Cloud computing. Is the Cloud service provider accessing the data? Is it legitimately applying the access control policy defined by the user? This paper presents a data-centric access control solution with enriched role-based expressiveness in which security is focused on protecting user data regardless the Cloud service provider that holds it. Novel identity-based and proxy re-encryption techniques are used to protect the authorization model. Data is encrypted and authorization rules are cryptographically protected to preserve user data against the service provider access or misbehavior. The authorization model provides high expressiveness with role hierarchy and resource hierarchy support. The solution takes advantage of the logic formalism provided by Semantic Web technologies, which enables advanced rule management like semantic conflict detection. A proof of concept implementation has been developed and a working prototypical deployment of the proposal has been integrated within Google services.},

A key challenge related to composition of such multi-organizational business processes and workflows is posed by the security and access control policies of the underlying organizational domains. In this paper, we propose a framework for verifying secure composability of distributed workflows in an autonomous multi-domain environment. The objective of workflow composability verification is to ensure that all the users or processes executing the designated workflow tasks conform to the time-dependent security policy specifications of all collaborating domains. A key aspect of such verification is to determine the time-dependent schedulability of distributed workflows, assumed to be invoked on a recurrent basis. We use a two-step approach for verifying secure workflow composability. In the first step, a distributed workflow is decomposed into domain-specific projected workflows and is verified for conformance with the respective domain's security and access control policy. In the second step, the cross-domain dependencies amongst the workflow tasks performed by different collaborating domains are verified.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, cloud computing is an emerging technology thanks to its ability to provide on-demand computing services (hardware and software) with less description standardization effort. Multiple issues and challenges in discovering cloud services appear due to the lack of the cloud service description standardization. In fact, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services while proposing ontologies. However, since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology ({CSO}), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. This paper contribution is threefold. First, it specifies a set of patterns and anti-patterns in order to evaluate {CSO}. Second, it defines an anti-pattern detection method based on {SPARQL} queries which provides a set of correction recommendations to help ontologists revise the ontology. Finally, some experiment tests were conducted in relation to: (i) the method efficiency and (ii) anti-pattern detection of design anomalies as well as taxonomic and domain errors within {CSO}.},

Nevertheless, due to security concerns, enterprises are reluctant to migrate their operations to the cloud. In addition, the proliferation of cloud services transforms the enterprise {IT} environment into a complex ecosystem of collaborating services. One way to tame this complexity and alleviate the security concerns is to rely on policies that regulate the deployment, delivery and governance of cloud services. However, the heterogeneity inherent in such services, coupled with the dynamic nature of cloud environments, hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable policies. This paper proposes a generic framework for the definition and representation of policies that are enforceable across diverse administrative domains and are amenable to automated correctness checks.},

Among its requirements, the C2NET platform needs a solution for catch, process and react to events triggered in different locations of collaborative manufacturing networks, which are endowed with devices that permits the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems ({CPS}). This paper presents the architecture and main functionality of a knowledge-based approach that allows processing supply chain events handled by {CPS} devices. The main component of the presented solution is the {SECA} ontology, which is a knowledge base that can be updated at runtime. The main purpose of the ontology is to describe events, their status and the actions to be performed once a set of events are triggered in certain order. This research work offers a solution that can be employed by the C2NET platform not only to catch and process events; but also to notify linked data consumers.},

	doi = {10.1109/CCI.2016.7778917},
	abstract = {This work proposes to include security and privacy into to context of Linked Open Data ({LOD}) and the Semantic Web. Here, a database partitioning approach to logically and physically separate data and distribute the partitions across several different cloud providers is applied. This data distribution is called fixed vertical partitioning and distribution approach ({FVPD}), as data schemes are vertically partitioned and distributed across various different cloud providers. Hence, this framework uses a security-by-distribution approach to storing sensitive data securely and privacy-ware in all possible cloud deployment models and thus, it provides a solution to improve the level of security and privacy. The proposed {FVPD} approach also becomes viable in the context of {LOD} and the Semantic Web. Furthermore, in relevant literature no approach in this context has been dealing with security and privacy so far. Therefore, this work transfers the {FVPD} approach from relational databases to Semantic Web Frameworks (Apache Jena, Sesame, etc.) that provide storage engines for {RDF} data and corresponding {SPARQL} endpoints. Above that, the query performance of such a federated environment is compared to a non-partitioned and non-distributed environment. For this, an adapted version of the {TPC}-W benchmark is used. Thus, this work shows how the query performance is affected when relational database data are exposed as {SPARQL} endpoints in {RDF}-based form and how the {FVPD} approach influences the query performance. Finally, it illustrates a mechanism to improve the level of security and privacy through a security-by-distribution approach.},

This new shift in the way that {IT} re-sources are offered to the user brings new challenges, such as cloud service discovery.

Locating the best and most appropriate cloud service with a suitable and capable provider is a primary concern for any consumer. In order to clearly comprehend the scope of this problem, a thorough analysis of the limitations of cloud service discovery approaches is required which, in turn, will empower researchers to deliver better solutions for consumers to make an informed decision and choose the right service. This paper presents an overview of the current cloud service discovery trends and challenges in recent studies. Additionally, the reviewed approaches are classified according to service discovery architecture and techniques. Furthermore, these approaches are compared and analysed from several perspectives including approach model/architecture, service type, ontology representation (domain, language, and reasoning), dynamic discovery model, evaluation model, user's preferences techniques, data updates, and public repositories.},

This research proposes a new architecture for handling Multi-Cloud Semantic Orchestration of {AI}-driven data pipelines to make {LLM} inference workflows more efficient, secure and in line with company policies. The framework makes it possible to effectively assign tasks and control data with the help of ontology-based knowledge graphs and added metadata by semantic enrichment. Our system uses distributed coordination engines, ensures both differential privacy and secure multiparty computation and selects appropriate models for proper latency, throughput and compliance. Experimental findings from using well-known {NLP} datasets show that the orchestration strategy proposed here reduces latency by up to 38 \% and ensures more privacy by 22 \% than standard single-cloud systems.

	abstract = {Cloud computing ({CC}) has the potential to augment collaboration, scalability, and accessibility, while providing cost-saving opportunities via enhanced and efficient computing, thus enabling enterprises to maintain focus. Cloud-based security ontologies are organized frameworks that delineate and classify topics pertinent to security in {CC} settings. They assist in standardizing language and enhance communication, interoperability, and comprehension among diverse stakeholders, including security experts, developers, and organizations. The ontology-based security strategy is one of the security solutions used by relevant parties. Nevertheless, target customers and cloud service providers see it as complex and lacking in security, since the applicable paradigms for various contexts are not clearly defined. Previous research has identified many security ideas that service providers might use, employing several evaluation methodologies. This highlights the growing need for reviewing the literature on Cloud Security Ontology ({CSO}). This research outlines the current state of the art in cloud computing ontology ({CCO}) and conducts a comprehensive literature review on the topic. Using the systematic literature review ({SLR}) approach, we identified 100 papers; 60 were selected based on established criteria, and 25 were assessed to be pertinent to the study. Scholars have shown active interest in four main areas of {CC}—service description, cloud security ({CS}), cloud resource management, cloud interoperability, and cloud service discovery—where cloud ontologies have had a significant impact. According to the research, fifteen of the thirty-one methods described in the literature for using ontologies in the cloud domain are still in use in legacy computing settings. The findings reveal several issues with improving company operations in cloud and multi-cloud settings via the use of ontologies. This paper delineates unsolved difficulties and potential future paths for academics in cloud ontology.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing and service computing, service recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping users efficiently filter the appropriate services. However, the sparsity of service data and the presence of noise in interactions make it extremely challenging to accurately capture user preferences. Existing service recommendation methods based on Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) primarily rely on {ID} aggregation, often neglecting the richness of textual semantics and are susceptible to interaction noise, resulting in suboptimal modeling of user-service relationships. Although Large Language Models ({LLMs}) demonstrate remarkable advantages in capturing textual semantics, current methods struggle to effectively align structural representations with textual representations, limiting improvements in recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-semantic graph diffusion model for service recommendation, {DiffMSR}, which aims to align textual and structural representations while learning the generation process of interaction graphs in a denoising manner. This approach mitigates data sparsity and effectively reduces noise interference. Specifically, the model leverages {LLMs} to capture the textual semantic features of service descriptions and integrates them with structured semantic information from knowledge graphs. Through cross-semantic contrastive learning, it achieves heterogeneous semantic alignment. Furthermore, the model introduces a multisemantic diffusion-based generation framework, which iteratively denoises to construct high-quality user-service interaction graphs. This significantly enhances the multi-semantic awareness of user representations, thereby improving recommendation performance. Experiments on public service datasets demonstrate that {DiffMSR} outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving improvements of 4.13\% and 6.37\% in recommendation accuracy and recall, respectively.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICSADL65848.2025.10933265},
	abstract = {The rapid expansion of cloud computing has led to increased energy consumption, raising concerns about its environmental impact. Despite advancements in scheduling algorithms, existing methods face critical challenges, including suboptimal energy efficiency, limited adaptability to dynamic cloud environments, and insufficient context-aware decision-making. Recent techniques, such as Meta Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and Energy-Aware Scheduling, show potential but often struggle with high computational complexity, static resource allocation, or scalability issues. These shortcomings result in inefficient resource utilization, elevated energy usage, and difficulties in meeting Service Level Agreement ({SLA}) requirements. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Energy Efficient Semantic Scheduling Framework ({ESSF}), a novel approach combining semantic reasoning and energy profiling to optimize task scheduling in dynamic cloud environments. The framework integrates three key components: (1) Dynamic Energy Profiling ({DEP}) for real-time energy monitoring, (2) Semantic Resource Matching ({SRM}) utilizing knowledge graphs for context-aware allocation, and (3) Adaptive Workload Balancing ({AWB}) to dynamically redistribute tasks for improved resource utilization and energy efficiency. Experiments using the Google Cluster Trace Dataset demonstrate that {ESSF} reduces energy consumption by up to 25\% compared to traditional methods while achieving 90\% resource utilization and 97\% {SLA} compliance. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to overcome existing limitations, offering a scalable, adaptive, and environmentally sustainable solution for task scheduling in cloud computing.},

	abstract = {In the context of the rapid development of service-oriented computing and cloud computing, selecting the service that meets the user’s needs from an ever-increasing number of Web services is always challenging. Exploiting auxiliary information such as a Knowledge Graph ({KG}) can significantly improve the effectiveness of service recommendations. However, current {KG}-based service recommendation methods usually merely integrate the knowledge semantic information into the user-service interaction model, which ignores the importance of global structure and does not fully consider the in-depth learning of individual user preferences. To this end, this paper proposes a Multi-Level View Contrastive Learning for Service Recommendation ({MCSR}) approach to address the above challenges. In particular, unlike traditional approaches that consider only two views, we consider three views, i.e., the global structure view, the local collaboration view, and the semantic view. Specifically, the user-service graph is regarded as the collaboration view, the service-entity graph as the semantic view, and the user-service-entity graph as the structural view. By applying contrastive learning across these views at different levels, {MCSR} fully leverages graph features and structural information, integrating auxiliary relational semantics into user-service interaction modeling. Furthermore, recognizing that the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly improving recommendation accuracy., since the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy. The experimental results show that {MCSR} significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, with the positive impact of its key components on the recommended performance verified by ablation experiments.},

	abstract = {The process of selecting Software as a Service ({SaaS}) in Cloud Computing depends on providers’ capabilities to articulate the non-functional attributes of their {SaaS} offerings semantically and understand customer requests along with their non-functional requirements. This study conceptualizes {SaaS} selection as a multi-criteria combinatorial problem within predefined constraints. To address this, we introduce a hybrid approach incorporating an entire optimization algorithm. Our method leverages semantic and microservice (individual) {SaaS} descriptions in the Ontology Web Language for Services ({OWL}-S). Each micro {SaaS} is linked to compatible {SaaS} instances (offering similar functionality) in a unified environment, guided by the compatibility concept. A micro-{SaaS} may not satisfy a particular functional need in specific contexts. However, it is possible to meet customer requirements by combining the available {SaaS} instances, called virtual {SaaS}. The chosen {SaaS} should be the best based on the defined quality and quantitative criteria. Our proposed approach, employing multi-criteria analysis, capitalizes on a dedicated Quality of Service ({QoS}) ontology tailored for the cloud environment and web applications. Moreover, a simulation design proved that a substantial selection of {SaaS}(s) could be achieved in a cloud.},

However, their inherent complexity and the intricate interplay of internal components heighten the risk of sporadic and unforeseen anomalies. To address these challenges, Root Cause Analysis ({RCA}) is employed to accurately identify problematic services (pods) and mine the precise faults behind observed anomalies. Tailored to the limitations of conventional {RCA} algorithms, we propose a novel approach that jointly models operation entities and their relationships as learnable embeddings. Additionally, this method integrates fault propagation information to further improve {RCA} accuracy. Our evaluation involves developing a prototype within the Kubernetes cloud-native system.

	doi = {10.1145/3639477.3639753},
	abstract = {Cloud service owners need to continuously monitor their services to ensure high availability and reliability. Gaps in monitoring can lead to delay in incident detection and significant negative customer impact. Current process of monitor creation is ad-hoc and reactive in nature. Developers create monitors using their tribal knowledge and, primarily, a trial and error based process. As a result, monitors often have incomplete coverage which leads to production issues, or, redundancy which results in noise and wasted effort. In this work, we address this issue by proposing an intelli-gent monitoring framework that recommends monitors for cloud services based on their service properties. We start by mining the attributes of 30,000+ monitors from 791 production services at Microsoft and derive a structured ontology for monitors. We focus on two crucial dimensions: what to monitor (resources) and which metrics to monitor. We conduct an extensive empirical study and derive key insights on the major classes of monitors employed by cloud services at Microsoft, their associated dimensions, and the interrelationship between service properties and this ontology. Using these insights, we propose a deep learning based framework that recommends monitors based on the service properties. Finally, we conduct a user study with engineers from Microsoft which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed framework. The proposed framework along with the ontology driven projections, succeeded in creating production quality rec-ommendations for majority of resource classes. This was also validated by the users from the study who rated the framework's usefulness as 4.27 out of 5.},

In this paradigm, knowledge graphs play a pivotal role by supplying vital background information and contextual understanding to hybrid intelligence systems.

Nevertheless, the use of untrusted cloud servers poses a risk of potential user data leaks. To address these concerns, this paper presents an encryption scheme specifically designed to protect graph data, enabling queries involving intermediate nodes in the shortest path between two nodes within the graph. The proposed scheme ensures the privacy and security of outsourced data by employing a novel method that utilizes padding dictionary structure encryption. This method ensures strict limitations on the cloud server's capabilities, restricting it solely to query operations, it effectively prevents any compromise of user data or unauthorized access to sensitive information, users can securely store and process their graph data on servers, significantly reducing the potential risk of data leakage and unauthorized breaches.

In order to meet these needs, cloud computing technologies have surfaced as a suitable answer, facilitating effective data sharing and interchange. With semantic information integration playing a crucial role, this is especially important for fully exploiting the advantages of cloud computing in enabling sophisticated analytics and mining for smart grids. In order to analyze grid data for power distribution, this essay proposes integrating the semantic web into a cloud-based research platform. The idea recommends using a service restoration technique to reenergize loads after an electrical failure. This presentation is implemented using {FIWARE}, a platform composed of modular, open-source building pieces designed for future internet services and applications. Moreover, the {SARGON} ontology-which was created especially for the energy domain-is used here. We test the integration of semantic data into the cloud-based service restoration application using the {IEC}61850 data model. This integration provides an access to the distribution grid's field devices. The platform's performance test, measured in terms of computing time and network latency, validates the viability of the suggested solution. The results of these experiments provide as a standard against which to measure the performance of smart energy platforms in the future, therefore advancing the field.},

Previous studies focused on similar information of users and products while neglecting relevance; therefore, they could not create recommendation approaches that account for functional dependencies among cloud products. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a cloud product set recommendation model based on a hierarchical knowledge graph ({KG}) with a pre-post correlation of product functionality. There are two main contributions: First, we constructed a cloud product functionality and performance {KG} using the dependency information of layers and entities to represent complicated pre-post logical connections. The {KG} was designed according to the cloud service model. Second, we designed an improved {PageRank} algorithm to obtain the importance weight for each functionality and performance, which replaces the original average method with the proportion of connection weight. We considered the release time of the functionality, launch time of the product, and last update time of the product as crucial factors in the recommendation score to reflect the importance of the functionality and current development stage of the product. Finally, our method recommended a product set based on the weighted scores from the above results. In addition, we constructed a cloud product functionality dataset containing 339 functionalities. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate a closely related set of products, leading to improved accuracy and higher satisfaction compared to mainstream methods.},

In order to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, this paper extracts the semantic directional features of discontinuous data and quantifies them. On the basis of quantization coding, {FCM} (fuzzy C means) algorithm is adopted to realize the directional beam clustering of semantic ontology features and improve the path mining algorithm. The research results show that the proposed algorithm is used to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, and the root mean square error of the path mining output is low, which shows that the path mining accuracy is higher than the traditional method and the anti-interference performance is strong.},

It aims to build a digital education mechanism and system platform based on cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology, and achieve accurate matching of vocational education with industry needs by establishing an education model of "data-driven-intelligent adaptation-dynamic feedback". First, crawler technology is used to integrate 46,000 cloud computing job recruitment data and 32 vocational college teaching data to construct a job capability knowledge graph; secondly, learner portraits are classified based on the K-means clustering algorithm, and a dynamic evaluation system containing 8 dimensions and 64 indicators is established; then a system architecture with three core functions of intelligent course recommendation, virtual training environment, and real-time capability assessment is designed, and an {LSTM} neural network is introduced for learning behavior prediction. Within a 12-month period of three pilot colleges, the system enables learners to achieve a job adaptation rate of 85.2\%, a mean resource allocation delay of 9.24ms, and an employment rate of 92.5\%, which verifies the remarkable effect of this mechanism in improving the adaptability of vocational education and provides a replicable technical path for vocational education reform under the background of digital transformation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In particular, unlike traditional approaches that consider only two views, we consider three views, i.e., the global structure view, the local collaboration view, and the semantic view. Specifically, the user-service graph is regarded as the collaboration view, the service-entity graph as the semantic view, and the user-service-entity graph as the structural view. By applying contrastive learning across these views at different levels, {MCSR} fully leverages graph features and structural information, integrating auxiliary relational semantics into user-service interaction modeling. Furthermore, recognizing that the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly improving recommendation accuracy., since the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy. The experimental results show that {MCSR} significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, with the positive impact of its key components on the recommended performance verified by ablation experiments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This research proposes a new architecture for handling Multi-Cloud Semantic Orchestration of {AI}-driven data pipelines to make {LLM} inference workflows more efficient, secure and in line with company policies. The framework makes it possible to effectively assign tasks and control data with the help of ontology-based knowledge graphs and added metadata by semantic enrichment. Our system uses distributed coordination engines, ensures both differential privacy and secure multiparty computation and selects appropriate models for proper latency, throughput and compliance. Experimental findings from using well-known {NLP} datasets show that the orchestration strategy proposed here reduces latency by up to 38\% and ensures more privacy by 22\% than standard single-cloud systems.

This study explores the implementation of Blockchain for educational data integrity, focusing on how decentralized ledger technologies ({DLTs}) and Merkle root methods enhance trust, transparency, and security in academic environments. By integrating an ontology-based framework, this research provides a structured approach to organizing and verifying digital credentials, student records, and institutional data. The ontology aids in reducing conceptual ambiguity and supports interoperability among diverse educational technologies. Through technical analysis of Blockchain components, such as Merkle trees, cryptographic hashes, and block structures, the study demonstrates how Blockchain ensures tamper-proof and verifiable data transactions.

	abstract = {Cloud computing ({CC}) has the potential to augment collaboration, scalability, and accessibility, while providing cost-saving opportunities via enhanced and efficient computing, thus enabling enterprises to maintain focus. Cloud-based security ontologies are organized frameworks that delineate and classify topics pertinent to security in {CC} settings. They assist in standardizing language and enhance communication, interoperability, and comprehension among diverse stakeholders, including security experts, developers, and organizations. The ontology-based security strategy is one of the security solutions used by relevant parties. Nevertheless, target customers and cloud service providers see it as complex and lacking in security, since the applicable paradigms for various contexts are not clearly defined. Previous research has identified many security ideas that service providers might use, employing several evaluation methodologies. This highlights the growing need for reviewing the literature on Cloud Security Ontology ({CSO}). This research outlines the current state of the art in cloud computing ontology ({CCO}) and conducts a comprehensive literature review on the topic. Using the systematic literature review ({SLR}) approach, we identified 100 papers; 60 were selected based on established criteria, and 25 were assessed to be pertinent to the study. Scholars have shown active interest in four main areas of {CC} - service description, cloud security ({CS}), cloud resource management, cloud interoperability, and cloud service discovery - where cloud ontologies have had a significant impact. According to the research, fifteen of the thirty-one methods described in the literature for using ontologies in the cloud domain are still in use in legacy computing settings. The findings reveal several issues with improving company operations in cloud and multi-cloud settings via the use of ontologies. This paper delineates unsolved difficulties and potential future paths for academics in cloud ontology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing and service computing, service recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping users efficiently filter the appropriate services. However, the sparsity of service data and the presence of noise in interactions make it extremely challenging to accurately capture user preferences. Existing service recommendation methods based on Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) primarily rely on {ID} aggregation, often neglecting the richness of textual semantics and are susceptible to interaction noise, resulting in suboptimal modeling of user-service relationships. Although Large Language Models ({LLMs}) demonstrate remarkable advantages in capturing textual semantics, current methods struggle to effectively align structural representations with textual representations, limiting improvements in recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-semantic graph diffusion model for service recommendation, {DiffMSR}, which aims to align textual and structural representations while learning the generation process of interaction graphs in a denoising manner. This approach mitigates data sparsity and effectively reduces noise interference. Specifically, the model leverages {LLMs} to capture the textual semantic features of service descriptions and integrates them with structured semantic information from knowledge graphs. Through cross-semantic contrastive learning, it achieves heterogeneous semantic alignment. Furthermore, the model introduces a multisemantic diffusion-based generation framework, which iteratively denoises to construct high-quality user-service interaction graphs. This significantly enhances the multi-semantic awareness of user representations, thereby improving recommendation performance. Experiments on public service datasets demonstrate that {DiffMSR} outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving improvements of 4.13\% and 6.37\% in recommendation accuracy and recall, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of cloud computing has led to increased energy consumption, raising concerns about its environmental impact. Despite advancements in scheduling algorithms, existing methods face critical challenges, including suboptimal energy efficiency, limited adaptability to dynamic cloud environments, and insufficient context-aware decision-making. Recent techniques, such as Meta Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and Energy-Aware Scheduling, show potential but often struggle with high computational complexity, static resource allocation, or scalability issues. These shortcomings result in inefficient resource utilization, elevated energy usage, and difficulties in meeting Service Level Agreement ({SLA}) requirements. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Energy Efficient Semantic Scheduling Framework ({ESSF}), a novel approach combining semantic reasoning and energy profiling to optimize task scheduling in dynamic cloud environments. The framework integrates three key components: (1) Dynamic Energy Profiling ({DEP}) for real-time energy monitoring, (2) Semantic Resource Matching ({SRM}) utilizing knowledge graphs for context-aware allocation, and (3) Adaptive Workload Balancing ({AWB}) to dynamically redistribute tasks for improved resource utilization and energy efficiency. Experiments using the Google Cluster Trace Dataset demonstrate that {ESSF} reduces energy consumption by up to 25\% compared to traditional methods while achieving 90\% resource utilization and 97\% {SLA} compliance. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to overcome existing limitations, offering a scalable, adaptive, and environmentally sustainable solution for task scheduling in cloud computing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This model achieves accurate identification and prediction of corporate financial risks by integrating advanced algorithms and knowledge graph technology. This article proposes a new risk prediction algorithm model that combines multiple methods such as machine learning, deep learning, and statistical analysis to learn patterns from historical data and predict future financial risks. In addition, the application of knowledge graph enables the model to better understand the internal connections of financial data and improve the accuracy of predictions. Finally, through system simulation experiments, this paper verifies the effectiveness and stability of the proposed model in practical applications.

This paper discusses the key challenges and solutions of data encryption technology in cloud computing, focusing on the application of symmetric and asymmetric encryption technologies and their effects. Comparative experimental analyses show that symmetric encryption has a processing speed of about 10,000 encryption operations per second and low resource consumption, while asymmetric encryption has a processing speed of about 500 encryption operations per second but excels in security and key management. The experimental results show that the combined use of symmetric and asymmetric encryption can achieve more efficient and secure data protection in cloud computing environments.

Based on graph convolutional neural networks, analyze the target load of cloud platforms, construct multi hop data transmission paths one by one, and perform deep level information load balancing; Establish a multiplexing information transmission model, correct the initial weights of graph convolutional neural networks, combine reverse transmission calculation methods, integrate and balance cloud computing resources, and confirm the optimal resource scheduling plan; Integrating class convolution and human-machine interaction attention mechanism, the value of the previous time series neural unit is transferred to the current neural unit, and the classification output sequence of knowledge graph relational data feature fragments is analyzed. The knowledge graph data fragments are processed based on class convolution and human-machine interaction attention mechanism, and different sizes of linear aggregators are used to capture deep level information, completing the design of cloud computing resource scheduling algorithm. The experimental results show that although the load rate is on the rise, the highest is only 89\%, and the scheduling rate is relatively high, ranging from 38.9 to 43.1bps; The energy consumption is relatively low, not exceeding 40.106mW.

	abstract = {Based on the diversified application scenarios at Ant Group, we built the Ant Knowledge Graph Platform ({AKGP}). It has constructed numerous domain-specific knowledge graphs related to merchants, companies, accounts, products, and more. {AKGP} manages trillions of structured knowledge graphs, serving search, recommendation, risk control and other businesses. However, as the demand increasing for various workloads such as graph pattern matching, graph representation learning, and cross-domain knowledge reuse, the existing warehouse systems based on relational {DBMS} or graph databases are unable to meet the requirements. To address these issues, we propose {KGFabric}, an industrial-scale knowledge graph management system built on the distributed file system ({DFS}). {KGFabric} offers a nearline knowledge storage engine that utilizes a Semantic-enhanced Programmable Graph ({SPG}) model, which is compatible with the Labeled Property Graph ({LPG}) model. The data is persistently stored in {DFS}, such as {HDFS}, which leverages the {POSIX} file system {API}, making it suitable for deployment in multi-cloud environment at low cost. {KGFabric} provides a native graph-based and hybrid storage format that can serve as a shared backend for parallel graph computing systems, significantly accelerating the analysis of multi-workload. Additionally, {KGFabric} includes a graph fabric framework that minimizes data duplication and guarantees data security. {KGFabric} is able to manage Peta-scale data and has supported graph fabric and analysis with over 100 billion relations at Ant Group. We conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate the performance of {KGFabric}. Compared with popular relational {DBMS} and graph databases, the storage space for semantic relations is reduced by over 90\%. The performance of graph fabric improves by 21X in real-world workloads. In multi-hop semantic graph analysis, {KGFabric} enhances performance by 100X. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The creation and execution of applications in several disciplines have been greatly aided by the integration of cloud computing and semantic web technologies. Although they are independent entities, they may also be combined in many ways to provide answers - a subject that has been thoroughly researched lately. The number of 'new cloud providers, applications, facilities, management systems, and data' has significantly increased in recent years. The complexity that has resulted from this expansion emphasises the need for new technology in order to efficiently manage and support these varied and many services and resources. As a result, difficulties with 'cloud services and resources' transferability, compatibility, security, choice, negotiation, identity, and specification might arise. Semantic Technologies are a vital tool for reassessing these issues because of their enormous 'cloud computing' capacity. This study uses a variety of sources to examine and evaluate the impact of 'Semantic-Web Technology' in the cloud. Moreover, a cloud-based engagement strategy shows how we may leverage the features and advantages of cloud computing to build the semantic web and provide automatic semantic annotations to online applications on a large scale. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, their inherent complexity and the intricate interplay of internal components heighten the risk of sporadic and unforeseen anomalies. To address these challenges, Root Cause Analysis ({RCA}) is employed to accurately identify problematic services (pods) and mine the precise faults behind observed anomalies. Tailored to the limitations of conventional {RCA} algorithms, we propose a novel approach that jointly models operation entities and their relationships as learnable embeddings. Additionally, this method integrates fault propagation information to further improve {RCA} accuracy. Our evaluation involves developing a prototype within the Kubernetes cloud-native system.

	abstract = {Cloud service owners need to continuously monitor their services to ensure high availability and reliability. Gaps in monitoring can lead to delay in incident detection and significant negative customer impact. Current process of monitor creation is ad-hoc and reactive in nature. Developers create monitors using their tribal knowledge and, primarily, a trial and error based process. As a result, monitors often have incomplete coverage which leads to production issues, or, redundancy which results in noise and wasted effort. In this work, we address this issue by proposing an intelli-gent monitoring framework that recommends monitors for cloud services based on their service properties. We start by mining the attributes of 30,000+ monitors from 791 production services at Microsoft and derive a structured ontology for monitors. We focus on two crucial dimensions: what to monitor (resources) and which metrics to monitor. We conduct an extensive empirical study and derive key insights on the major classes of monitors employed by cloud services at Microsoft, their associated dimensions, and the interrelationship between service properties and this ontology. Using these insights, we propose a deep learning based framework that recommends monitors based on the service properties. Finally, we conduct a user study with engineers from Microsoft which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed framework. The proposed framework along with the ontology driven projections, succeeded in creating production quality rec-ommendations for majority of resource classes. This was also validated by the users from the study who rated the framework's usefulness as 4.27 out of 5. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The process of selecting Software as a Service ({SaaS}) in Cloud Computing depends on providers' capabilities to articulate the non-functional attributes of their {SaaS} offerings semantically and understand customer requests along with their non-functional requirements. This study conceptualizes {SaaS} selection as a multi-criteria combinatorial problem within predefined constraints. To address this, we introduce a hybrid approach incorporating an entire optimization algorithm. Our method leverages semantic and microservice (individual) {SaaS} descriptions in the Ontology Web Language for Services ({OWL}-S). Each micro {SaaS} is linked to compatible {SaaS} instances (offering similar functionality) in a unified environment, guided by the compatibility concept. A micro-{SaaS} may not satisfy a particular functional need in specific contexts. However, it is possible to meet customer requirements by combining the available {SaaS} instances, called virtual {SaaS}. The chosen {SaaS} should be the best based on the defined quality and quantitative criteria. Our proposed approach, employing multi-criteria analysis, capitalizes on a dedicated Quality of Service ({QoS}) ontology tailored for the cloud environment and web applications. Moreover, a simulation design proved that a substantial selection of {SaaS}(s) could be achieved in a cloud. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of cloud computing, Massive Open Online Courses ({MOOCs}) have gained popularity. However, current {MOOCs} platforms encounter challenges in personalized learning due to disorganized resources, and the inability to capture dynamic learning demands. We present a dynamic scheduling system for multi-module cloud course resources using deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, a knowledge graph and conceptualization ability model are constructed to evaluate students' knowledge mastery levels. The dynamic demands are modeled as Markov Decision Processes, and optimized matching strategies are derived via deep Q-learning to satisfy personalized requirements. A reward function is designed to maximize students' knowledge conceptualization ability. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. This work provides a new intelligent solution to adaptively schedule cloud course resources. The core innovations lie in accurate dynamic modeling, and adaptive resource provisioning strategies for personalized learning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Despite some research on key-value query and range query in this hybrid-storage scenario, other more complicated data types are not yet supported. In this article, we conduct pioneering research on authenticated queries for graph data, which is a popular data type such as the knowledge graph data, on the blockchain-assisted cloud. The primary challenge is how to design an authenticated data structure ({ADS}) that supports authenticated queries and can be easily maintained by the blockchain. To this end, we propose a novel {ADS}, named {PAGB}, based on the {RSA} accumulator and completeness set. It can also prevent the original data from being revealed to the public through blockchain or irrelevant queries. We further optimize our design to be more efficient in terms of communication and computation. The effectiveness and efficiency of {PAGB} are verified through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Hybrid intelligence has emerged as an innovative approach that synergistically combines the strengths of human intelligence and artificial intelligence ({AI}) to address complex problems. In this paradigm, knowledge graphs play a pivotal role by supplying vital background information and contextual understanding to hybrid intelligence systems. However, due to limitations in local storage capacity, managing large-scale graph data often requires outsourcing to cloud servers. Nevertheless, the use of untrusted cloud servers poses a risk of potential user data leaks. To address these concerns, this paper presents an encryption scheme specifically designed to protect graph data, enabling queries involving intermediate nodes in the shortest path between two nodes within the graph. The proposed scheme ensures the privacy and security of outsourced data by employing a novel method that utilizes padding dictionary structure encryption. This method ensures strict limitations on the cloud server's capabilities, restricting it solely to query operations, it effectively prevents any compromise of user data or unauthorized access to sensitive information, users can securely store and process their graph data on servers, significantly reducing the potential risk of data leakage and unauthorized breaches. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution, practical experiments were conducted using real-world data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In order to meet these needs, cloud computing technologies have surfaced as a suitable answer, facilitating effective data sharing and interchange. With semantic information integration playing a crucial role, this is especially important for fully exploiting the advantages of cloud computing in enabling sophisticated analytics and mining for smart grids. In order to analyze grid data for power distribution, this essay proposes integrating the semantic web into a cloud-based research platform. The idea recommends using a service restoration technique to reenergize loads after an electrical failure. This presentation is implemented using {FIWARE}, a platform composed of modular, open-source building pieces designed for future internet services and applications. Moreover, the {SARGON} ontology-which was created especially for the energy domain-is used here. We test the integration of semantic data into the cloud-based service restoration application using the {IEC}61850 data model. This integration provides an access to the distribution grid's field devices. The platform's performance test, measured in terms of computing time and network latency, validates the viability of the suggested solution. The results of these experiments provide as a standard against which to measure the performance of smart energy platforms in the future, therefore advancing the field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Previous studies focused on similar information of users and products while neglecting relevance; therefore, they could not create recommendation approaches that account for functional dependencies among cloud products. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a cloud product set recommendation model based on a hierarchical knowledge graph ({KG}) with a pre-post correlation of product functionality. There are two main contributions: First, we constructed a cloud product functionality and performance {KG} using the dependency information of layers and entities to represent complicated pre-post logical connections. The {KG} was designed according to the cloud service model. Second, we designed an improved {PageRank} algorithm to obtain the importance weight for each functionality and performance, which replaces the original average method with the proportion of connection weight. We considered the release time of the functionality, launch time of the product, and last update time of the product as crucial factors in the recommendation score to reflect the importance of the functionality and current development stage of the product. Finally, our method recommended a product set based on the weighted scores from the above results. In addition, we constructed a cloud product functionality dataset containing 339 functionalities. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate a closely related set of products, leading to improved accuracy and higher satisfaction compared to mainstream methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Generally speaking, this kind of data has time attribute, and it hopes to show some time-varying characteristics on the basis of keeping the hierarchical structure clear. Using path mining to analyze discontinuous data paths in cloud computing environment, we can find the location and data state of discontinuous data paths. Classifying and counting discontinuous data is beneficial to the efficient use of data. In this paper, the optimization of discontinuous data path mining based on fuzzy clustering algorithm is studied. In order to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, this paper extracts the semantic directional features of discontinuous data and quantifies them. On the basis of quantization coding, {FCM} (fuzzy C means) algorithm is adopted to realize the directional beam clustering of semantic ontology features and improve the path mining algorithm. The research results show that the proposed algorithm is used to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, and the root mean square error of the path mining output is low, which shows that the path mining accuracy is higher than the traditional method and the anti-interference performance is strong. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our graph-based {EHR} has been developed by integrating Attribute-based Encryption ({ABE}) with ontology reasoning using Semantic Web technologies. The novelty of our approach lies in providing differential access to an {EHR} by using a comprehensive knowledge graph that stores all medical data as encrypted nodes, thereby handling heterogeneous patient data while preserving good performance.

	abstract = {This article discusses the problem of implementing the Data Fabric architecture as a technology for sustainable data processing and storage for the modernization of industrial platforms in transport and road systems. To perform complex tasks like monitoring road transport facilities entails huge resources for storing interactive data online. The concept of transport enterprises moving to cloud systems opens up gaps in data management in hybrid and multi-cloud systems. To solve such problems, the implementation of the Data Fabric structure allows you to integrate data and metadata for use on various platforms. The sustainable development of such platforms is facilitated by the use of the Data Fabric mechanism as a built-in system for standardization and coding, the implementation of semantic compatibility, proprietary knowledge graphs and the domain of data values of the transport industry. Data Fabric helps organizations solve complex data problems and use cases by managing their data regardless of application types, platforms, and storage locations, while ensuring seamless data access and sharing in a distributed data environment. The article analyzes the stability of the Data Fabric platform as a domain-oriented decomposition model based on a distributed data architecture with centralized management, but not as a fragmented data warehouse. Using the example of such a decomposition, it is necessary to model an architecture that organizes analytical and other data by areas. In this architecture, the domain's interface with the rest of the organization includes not only operational capabilities, but also access to the analytical data that the domain serves to scale the system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These agreements list the service terms and metrics to be agreed upon by the service providers and the customers. Current cloud {SLAs} are text documents that require significant manual effort to parse and determine if providers meet the {SLAs}. Moreover, due to the lack of standardization, providers differ in the way they define the terms and metrics, making it more difficult to compare different provider {SLAs}. We have developed a novel framework to significantly automate the process of extracting knowledge embedded in cloud {SLAs} and representing it in a semantically rich knowledge graph helping the user to make a calculated decision in choosing a provider. Our framework captures the key terms, measures, and deontic rules, in the form of obligations and permissions present in the cloud {SLAs}.

Within this context, it is required to develop new methodologies as well as technical tools for network-based knowledge representation, knowledge services and knowledge engineering. Obviously, the term 'network' has different meanings in different scenarios. Meanwhile, some breakthroughs in several bottleneck problems of complex networks promote the developments of the new methodologies and technical tools for network-based knowledge representation, knowledge services and knowledge engineering. This paper first reviews some recent advances on complex networks, and then, in conjunction with knowledge graph, proposes a framework of networked knowledge which models knowledge and its relationships with the perspective of complex networks. For the unique advantages of deep learning in acquiring and processing knowledge, this paper reviews its development and emphasizes the role that it played in the development of knowledge engineering.

	abstract = {With the rapid implementation of Cloud-based Electronic Health Record ({EHR}) systems, health providers are specifically concerned about handling data privacy on the cloud. Existing methods have either scalability issues by requiring that patients grant access to their medical data or a trust issue by having a single authority, thereby creating the problem of a single point of attack. Hence there is a need to develop an {EHR} system that addresses these bottlenecks for safe, secure, and easy cloud-based {EHR} management. To address these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that allows policy-based multi-authority access permission to Electronic Health Record systems used by multiple care providers from various places or organizations. This framework, residing on the Edge, has been built using the Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption ({MA}-{ABE}) and Semantic Web technologies to provide a safe, semantically rich approach to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations who manage different attributes of end-users using a shared dataset. This paper describes our novel approach and the proof of concept prototype that we created to evaluate our framework. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The recent incorporation of new Data Mining and Machine Learning services within Cloud Computing providers is empowering users with extremely comprehensive data analysis tools including all the advantages of this type of environment. Providers of Cloud Computing services for Data Mining publish the descriptions and definitions in many formats and often not compatible with other providers. From a functional point of view, having the possibility to describe complete Data Mining services is fundamental to maintain the usability and especially the portability of these services independently of the software/hardware support or even the differences between cloud platforms. The main objective of this article is to design a Data Mining service definition which allows to compose with a single and simple definition a complete service, in such way a data mining workflow can be ported and deployed in different providers or even in a Market Place of this type of ready-to-consume services. This article presents a semantic scheme for the definition and description of complete Data Mining services considering both the management of the service by the provider (price, authentication, Service Level Agreement,...) and the definition of the Data Mining workflow as a service. It represents a solid contribution for paving the way to the standardization and industrialization of Data Mining services. To asses the validity of the scheme a list of services from Data Mining providers have been described and an example of a full service for a Random Forest algorithm has been defined as a service. In addition, a practical scenario has been developed, creating a deployment platform for Data Mining services to give functional support to the scheme, illustrating the practical benefits of the proposal for the end user. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Based on analysis, conversion, extraction and refinement for the big data, a disease can be prevented and group behavior can be predicted. However, each user's private data is also an element in big data. Users must provide private data to the service providers to meet their functional requirements. To gain economic benefits, some {SaaS} service providers have not been authorized to collect and analyze the user's sensitive private data, as a result, the user's private data is disclosed. In this paper, we propose a private data chain disclosure discovery method, to prevent a user's sensitive privacy information from being illegally disclosed. First, we measure the similarity degree and cost of the disclosure of the private data. Second, according to the similarity degree and cost of disclosure, the disclosure chain and key private data are detected in the process of interaction between user and {SaaS} service. Third, we propose a discovery framework for the private data chain and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness by experiments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth in biological sequence data is revolutionizing our understanding of genotypic diversity and challenging conventional approaches to informatics. With the increasing availability of genomic data, traditional bioinformatic tools require substantial computational time and the creation of ever-larger indices each time a researcher seeks to gain insight from the data. To address these challenges, we pre-computed important relationships between biological entities spanning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and captured this information in a relational database. The database can be queried across hundreds of millions of entities and returns results in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. In this paper, we describe Functional Genomics Platform (formerly known as {OMXWare}), a comprehensive database relating genotype to phenotype for bacterial life. Continually updated, the Functional Genomics Platform today contains data derived from 200,000 curated, self-consistently assembled genomes. The database stores functional data for over 68 million genes, 52 million proteins, and 239 million domains with associated biological activity annotations from Gene Ontology, {KEGG}, {MetaCyc}, and Reactome. The Functional Genomics Platform maps all of the many-To-many connections between each biological entity including the originating genome, gene, protein, and protein domain. Various microbial studies, from infectious disease to environmental health, can benefit from the rich data and connections. We describe the data selection, the pipeline to create and update the Functional Genomics Platform, and the developer tools (Python {SDK} and {REST} {APIs})which allow researchers to efficiently study microbial life at scale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To ensure a secure Cloud-based Electronic Health Record ({EHR}) system, we need to encrypt data and impose field-level access control to prevent malicious usage. Since the attributes of the Users will change with time, the encryption policies adopted may also vary. For large {EHR} systems, it is often necessary to search through the encrypted data in realtime and perform client-side computations without decrypting all patient records. This paper describes our novel cloud-based {EHR} system that uses Attribute Based Encryption ({ABE}) combined with Semantic Web technologies to facilitate differential access to an {EHR}, thereby ensuring only Users with valid attributes can access a particular field of the {EHR}. The system also includes searchable encryption using keyword index and search trapdoor, which allows querying {EHR} fields without decrypting the entire patient record. The attribute revocation feature is efficiently managed in our {EHR} by delegating the revision of the secret key and ciphertext to the Cloud Service Provider ({CSP}). Our methodology incorporates advanced security features that eliminate malicious use of {EHR} data and contributes significantly towards ensuring secure digital health systems on the Cloud. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In {PaaS} model, providers have different proprietary {APIs}, which make developers locked inside a specific platform and not able to easily port their applications among different platforms. So, vendor lock-in problem appeared. One solution to this problem is to use generic {APIs} with specific adapters. However, any update in a {PaaS} specific-{API} makes its corresponding adapter is unusable which causes, what we call, {API} synchronization problem. Therefore, {STAGER} ({SemanTic}-based {GenERation} of Generic-{API} Adapters) framework is proposed. {STAGER} framework provides a semi-automatic adapter generation process, which generates specific adapters of generic {APIs} for {PaaS} services (e.g., blob storage and datastore services) for target {PaaS} platforms. The adapter generation process is based on semantic annotations of the generic {APIs} and their corresponding {PaaS} specific-{APIs}. In order to evaluate {STAGER} framework, two generic {APIs} for blob storage and {NoSQL} datastore services have been proposed. {STAGER} framework is used to generate the adapters of these generic {APIs} for two {PaaS} platforms: Google App Engine ({GAE}) and Windows Azure. Although there is some overhead for semantically annotating the {PaaS} {APIs}, the evaluation results prove the feasibility of {STAGER} framework and promote the usage of the generated adapters for implementing portable cloud applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Keyword search over encrypted data is essential for accessing outsourced sensitive data in cloud computing. In some circumstances, the keywords that the user searches on are only semantically related to the data rather than via an exact or fuzzy match. Hence, semantic-based keyword search over encrypted cloud data becomes of paramount importance. However, existing schemes usually depend upon a global dictionary, which not only affects the accuracy of search results but also causes inefficiency in data updating. Additionally, although compound keyword search is common in practice, the existing approaches only process them as single words, which split the original semantics and achieve low accuracy. To address these limitations, we initially propose a compound concept semantic similarity ({CCSS}) calculation method to measure the semantic similarity between compound concepts. Next, by integrating {CCSS} with Locality-Sensitive Hashing function and the secure \$k\$k-Nearest Neighbor scheme, a semantic-based compound keyword search ({SCKS}) scheme is proposed. {SCKS} achieves not only semantic-based search but also multi-keyword search and ranked keyword search. Additionally, {SCKS} also eliminates the predefined global library and can efficiently support data update. The experimental results on real-world dataset indicate that {SCKS} introduces low overhead on computation and the search accuracy outperforms the existing schemes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Big services have recently emerged from the synergy between big data and cloud computing paradigms. This new big data-centric service model aims to provide customer-oriented massive services by combining both physical and virtualized resources from different domains. Although such complex ecosystem is able to process, encapsulate and offer huge volumes of data as services, its management operations are beyond the ability of human administrators, due to several challenges including the big services' large-scale nature and complexity, the heterogeneity of their components (e.g., services, data sources, connected things), the dynamicity and uncertainty of their hosting cloud environments. To cope with the lack of understanding regarding big services capabilities, we propose to describe them using a novel meta-model for the quality of big services ({QoBS}). We also take advantage of a recent technology called knowledge graphs, to represent the big service information (service descriptions, services' and data sources' quality levels, management policies) as a heterogeneous information network. Finally, a multi-view representation learning approach is proposed to infer additional knowledge regarding big services capabilities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, this has been faced with several challenges, such as disparate nature of existing solutions and lack of scalability in proportion to web scale. With a holistic perspective to web content semantic annotation, this paper focuses on leveraging cloud computing for these challenges. To achieve this, a set of requirements towards holistic semantic annotation on the web is defined and mapped with cloud computing mechanisms to facilitate them. Technical specification for the requirements is critically reviewed and examined against each of the cloud computing mechanisms, in relation to their technical functionalities. Hence, a mapping is established if the cloud computing mechanism's functionalities proffer a solution for implementation of a requirement's technical specification. The result is a cloud computing capability model for holistic semantic annotation which presents an approach towards delivering large-scale semantic annotation on the web via a cloud platform. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cloud-based electronic health records ({EHR}) systems provide important security controls by encrypting patient data. However, these records cannot be queried without decrypting the entire record. This incurs a huge amount of burden in network bandwidth and the client-side computation. As the volume of cloud-based {EHRs} reaches Big Data levels, it is essential to search over these encrypted patient records without decrypting them to ensure that the medical caregivers can efficiently access the {EHRs}. This is especially critical if the caregivers have access to only certain sections of the patient {EHR} and should not decrypt the whole record. In this paper, we present our novel approach that facilitates searchable encryption of large {EHR} systems using Attribute-based Encryption ({ABE}) and multi-keyword search techniques. Our framework outsources key search features to the cloud side. This way, our system can perform keyword searches on encrypted data with significantly reduced costs of network bandwidth and client-side computation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data has emerged as a central commodity in most modern applications. Unregulated and rampant collection of user and usage data by applications led to concerns on privacy, trust, and ethics. This has resulted in several governments and organizations across geographies to frame laws on data (e.g., the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ({GDPR})) that govern and define boundaries for the storage, processing and transitioning of data; and thereby safeguard the interests of its citizens. Data Sovereignty and Data Localization are two important aspects, which deal with the adherence to the laws and governance structures, that define where and how data is collected and processed. The applicability of different laws depends upon several attributes such as the nature, type, and purpose of data. Non-compliance to laws/regulations can lead to serious repercussions for enterprises, ranging from hefty penalties to loss of brand value. Ensuring that all of their applications are complaint to various laws and regulations is non-trivial. Enterprises have to deal with a plethora of laws (that are constantly evolving) and are often confused even in correctly identifying all the applicable laws for their context leave alone ensuring compliance to regulations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a knowledge graph based data sovereignty governance framework that assists in classifying data and in identifying the relevant applicable laws. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To address data protection concerns, authorities and standards bodies worldwide have released a plethora of regulations, guidelines, and software controls to be applied to Cloud data. As a result, service providers maintaining their end-user's private attributes have seen a surge in compliance requirements. Since most of these regulations are not available in a machine-processable format, it requires significant manual effort to adhere to them. Often many of the laws have overlapping rules, but as they are not referencing each other, providers must duplicate efforts to comply with each regulation. We have done a detailed study of all the data protection regulations that apply to Cloud data. We have developed an integrated, semantically rich knowledge graph that captures these various data compliance regulations. It includes the data threats and security controls that are needed to mitigate the risks. In this paper, we present this knowledge graph in detail, along with the system that we have developed to evaluate it. We have validated our knowledge graph against the privacy policies of various Cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, {IBM}, and Rackspace. This knowledge graph is available in the public domain and can be used by organizations to automate their compliance processes and set their enterprise Cloud security policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {{IP} prefix hijacking continues to be a pervasive cyber security threat to the core internet routing infrastructure. The data security of multiple cloud-based services is also susceptible to these threats, due to the high dependency on traditional routing protocols. Although a number of hijacking detection techniques have been recently proposed, no existing system has effectively addressed the problem of detecting malicious transit Autonomous System ({AS}) services in any detected hijacking occurrences. The ability to locate and isolate malicious services is critical for conducting a necessary mitigation strategy at an early stage, to minimise the impact of the attack, to restore cloud services quickly. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time processing method, so-called Ontological Graph Identification ({OGI}), for detecting {IP} prefix hijacking of nodes and suspicious transit nodes caused by the hijacked nodes through {ASs}. The proposed method is evaluated using the two public datasets of {RIPE} {RIS} and {RouteView}. Experimental results revealed improved performance for the detection of malicious transit nodes compared with peer techniques. It is, therefore, shown that the proposed method has utility in automating the process of investigating nodes with suspicious activities in real network systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is witnessing a fast development and widespread adoption from small to large organizations due to its cost-effective and resource-efficient services. Nevertheless, security risks remain major concerns. One of the main challenges is how to evaluate the security level of cloud services. Among the problems arising are the large variety of knowledge associated with the security domain and the heterogeneity of cloud services descriptions. An effective solution to such problems is ontologies. Ontologies provide a more structured and formal representation of a particular domain, which will help to reduce the conceptual ambiguity and enable automatic reasoning functionalities. In this paper, we propose an ontology for cloud services security evaluation based on industry standards and best practices. Some of the core concepts included in the ontology are the target, criteria, yardstick, data gathering techniques and data synthesis approaches. The concepts are grouped into five general categories, namely: context, assumptions, external factors, activities, and outcomes. The ontology is implemented using Protégé tool and validated through different uses case scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Thus, a uniform description of Cloud services would be needed. The aim of this study is to provide a new ontology for uniform description of Cloud services coming from heterogeneous sources. The proposed model takes into account the different relationships and dependencies between services across Cloud's layers. These dependencies are represented by the different constraints of composition and deployment. To validate our proposal, qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted. The qualitative evaluation is carried out by making comparisons with both state-of-the-art works and the Bitnami platform according to some criteria. For the quantitative evaluation, comparisons are performed with the output results specified by users.

Due to the development of big data with high dimensionality, data storage possibility over cloud has created large scope in recent times. Document clustering is the fundamental topic that turned into an indispensable component in many areas like cloud computing. Document clustering partitions the document into significant classes or groups for retrieving the relevant document. Many researchers used the factorization methods and ontologies for internal and external knowledge based document clustering. However, existing methods failed to provide the semantic feature construction and leads to the information loss while covering all the ideas in documents. In order to address these problems, different document clustering techniques in cloud has been reviewed in this paper. In addition to that Document clustering by Entropy-based Boosting with Projection Neural Feature ({EB}-{PNF}) method is presented. The proposed method involves two stages. They are, similar document identification based on semantic similarity score, feature extraction which includes the extraction of both single and multi-label features based on the precision, recall and computational complexity to prove that {EB}-{PNF} method produces high-quality clusters comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Existing approaches have either a scalability bottleneck by requiring that patients approve each sharing of their medical data or a trust bottleneck by having a single authority control every access thereby creating the problem of a single point of attack. To address both these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that enables policy based multi-authority access authorization to {EHR} systems accessed by multiple care providers from different locations or organizations. This framework, which resides on the Edge, has been built using the Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption ({MA}-{ABE}) and Semantic Web technologies to provide a secure, semantically rich approach to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations who manage different attributes of end users using a shared dataset. In this paper, we describe our novel approach along with the proof of concept prototype that we created to evaluate our framework. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Since in this environment, massive amounts of data have been generated and collected, integration and management of various data sources is of paramount importance. In this context, cloud computing as a crucial part of Industry 4.0 facilitates distribution of computer resources without direct active management by users. Accordingly, an ontology enables efficient integration and management of data as a reference data model through representation of knowledge. Besides, data mining from massive data is very important to identify significant meaning of data, and to avoid unexpected errors through predictions from experiences described in data replica.

To effectively manage and integrate security requirements in the cloud, the provider and customer needs to negotiate and agree upon the applied security policies. However, there is no standard way of expressing cloud security policies in a vendor-agnostic manner. Cloud security and privacy policies are often stated in an informal and ad-hoc manner, which leads to policy conflicts, incompleteness, ambiguity and inconsistencies. In this paper, we present {CERBERUS}, a framework for representing cloud security and privacy policies and detecting potential problems in the policies. {CERBERUS} adopts an object-oriented approach and consists of an ontology and notation, policies, guidelines and rules, and a tool for capturing and detecting policy errors. Using {CERBERUS}, policies can be analyzed for potential problems, including policy conflicts, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness. An application of {CERBERUS} shows that it indeed helps to discover policy errors, which otherwise would go undetected or in many cases would be detected a posteriori at runtime. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Since there is no standard about Cloud service description or publication, therefore a key requirement that every Cloud provider needs to take into consideration is efficient management of resources and services by providing automated solutions, for a better service publication and discovery. The proposed approach aims to manage Cloud {SaaS} services for an efficient publication by classifying them into sets according to their domain to reduce the search space then interconnecte the {SaaS} services of the same domain in a Semantic Network using the similarity measure (Input/Output similarity) between concepts.

While several tools exist for providing semantic annotation to web documents, the techniques used in these tools vary very widely. Also, the mode of implementation and the solutions offered by the tools are inconsistent with each other leaving end users confused on the appropriate tool for use to deliver their expected results. Based on these, a holistic perspective to the development of semantic annotation tools as well as their implementation is necessary. This is to ensure uniformity in the expected end results and guarantee a continuous, dynamic and consistent semantic annotation for web documents; encompassing the complete needs of end users. To achieve this, cloud computing is proposed for the delivery of semantic annotation as a holistic service, as it provides an enabling environment for processing the vast amount of data required to annotate web documents. Also, cloud computing essential characteristics such as ubiquitous network access, rapid elasticity and on-demand self-service are very necessary to achieve a holistic semantic annotation service for documents on the web.

While the current workflow management systems implement mostly different complicated graphical tasks based on advanced distributed solutions (e.g., cloud computing and grid computation), workflow knowledge acquisition from texts using case-based reasoning represents more expressive and semantic case representations. We propose in this context, an ontology-based workflow extraction framework to acquire processual knowledge from texts. Our methodology extends the classic {NLP} techniques to extract and disambiguate complex tasks and relations in texts. Using a graph-based representation of workflows and a domain ontology, our extraction process uses a context-aware approach to recognize workflow components in texts: data and control flows. We applied our framework in a technical domain in bioinformatics: i.e., phylogenetic analyses. An evaluation based on workflow semantic similarities in a gold standard proves that our approach provides promising results in the process extraction domain.

	abstract = {Today, the Web knows a rapid increase in data level that makes their processing and storage limited in traditional technologies. That is why future technology tries to exploit the notion of semantics and ontology by adapting them to big data technology to allow a fundamental change in the access to voluminous information in the web. That Intended to have a complete and relevant response to the user request. Our research work focuses on the semantic web. Focus exactly on the semantic search on many data expressed by {RDF} (Resource Description Framework) in distributed system. The semantic language proposed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) provides the formalism necessary for the representation of data for the Semantic Web. However, only a knowledge representation format is insufficient and we need powerful response mechanisms to manage effectively global and distributed queries across a set of stand-alone and heterogeneous {RDF} resources marked by the dynamic and scalable nature of their content. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mobile Cloud Computing ({MCC}) requires an infrastructure that is combining the capabilities of resource-constrained but mobile and context-aware devices with that of immovable but powerful resources in the cloud. Application execution shall be boosted and battery consumption reduced. Our goal is to relieve mobile devices by enabling applications to cooperate transparently with components provided by third parties remotely, locally, or both. For this purpose, we developed {SAM} - the Semantic-aware Middleware - and the {SAM} Store. The latter resembles a registry. It allows component providers to publish semantically enriched interfaces and to offer corresponding local and remote implementations. {SAM} makes use of the {SAM} Store to match local interprocess communication ({IPC}) messages transparently against local and remote components. This architecture facilitates the integration of powerful, but resource-intensive remote components, which may be prioritized over local ones, and fosters various patterns of cooperation that demonstrate useful solutions in the area of {MCC}. By means of a realistic scenario, our evaluation proves the efficiency with respect to latency and practicality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Medical organizations find it challenging to adopt cloud-based electronic medical records services, due to the risk of data breaches and the resulting compromise of patient data. Existing authorization models follow a patient centric approach for {EHR} management where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients' end. This however creates a significant overhead for the patient who has to authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given the multiple personnel involved in providing care and that at times the patient may not be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need of developing a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy cloud-based {EHR} management. We have developed a novel, centralized, attribute based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption ({ABE}) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based {EHR}'s access authority to the medical providers. In this paper, we describe this novel {ABE} approach as well as the prototype system that we have created to illustrate it. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of cloud computing and micro service architectures, various service ecosystems including services, venders, and service-based processes continuously emerge on Internet or in an enterprise. Semantics of services from different venders may be described by distributed domain ontologies. Distributed knowledge brings difficulty to competition and cooperation among services, and hampers the evolution of a service ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a distributed knowledge based evolution model ({DKEM}) to promote competition and cooperation among services from different venders. {DKEM} considers stability as key factor in competition, and a stability evaluation model is designed to compute stability of services, venders, and service-based processes according to service invocation histories. Based on the evaluation model, two evolution patterns are given, and they can automatically explore new and more stable cooperation among services by means of runtime self-adaption mechanism. A prototype system for {DKEM} is implemented and a series of experiments show that {DKEM} is effective for competition and cooperation among services with distributed knowledge, and, evolved processes have higher stability and response efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing offers attractive options to migrate corporate applications without the end users needing to manage any physical resources. While this 'ease' is appealing, several issues arise: 1) Which Cloud Providers ({CPs}) offer the best infrastructure at a fair budget? 2) I am no Cloud expert, then what are the characteristics of the infrastructure which best fit my application? To answer these questions, one must solve a resource management problem, that is, the allocation of computing, storage, networking and (indirectly) cost resources to a set of applications such that the performance objectives of the application are fulfilled. There are many approaches which answer separately these questions but there is no comprehensive and easily usable solution for these issues. {MANeUveR} solves them by integrating the following components: 1) a Web User Interface offers the end user the possibility to describe his application in terms of interactions between components and their software and hardware requirements, 2) an Offers Management System, through a crawler, periodically updates an ontology with infrastructure and services details from different {CPs}, 3) a Recommendation Engine provides a (sub) optimal solution for application deployment in the {CP} infrastructure regarding the leasing price of the virtual machines needed for deployment and their characteristics. Using a secure-billing e-mail service, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In today's era of digitization, due to the improper structuring of huge data available from various sources leading to poor interlinking of data, the web is not being utilized to its full potential. So, there is a need for re-establishing the structures of openly published data on the web by giving various specifications or frameworks of data published in cyberspace. With the aim of better utilization of web data and transition from keyword-based search to contextual search, the Semantic web has emerged as a key milestone. In this direction, Tim Berners Lee has proposed the conventions namely {RDF} and {SPARQL} for linking and querying the machine-processable shared data on the web and also a 5-star linked data scheme to distinguish the type of data on web based on its linking properties. This paper presents a Framework for Linking and querying open datasets on government portals, embedding semantics in the data by {RDF} alignment using state-of-art tools such as {OpenRefine} and Twinkle tool. The 5-Star scheme has been discussed and practical demonstration of enriching data is given. This clearly puts forward the transition from web of documents to web of data. This paper also presents the framework for translating the data in datasets to the graph based {RDF} data in Triple format. This translated data is then queried using standard {SPARQL} Queries showcasing the linked data fetched in tuple format. The data-graph of the resultant linked data is also presented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the Cloud Computing field, with the increasing number of Cloud Services available thanks to several cloud providers, looking for a particular service has become very difficult, especially with the evolution of the stakeholders' needs. At the same time requirements specifications have become more and more complex to define in a formal representation and to analyse, since the stakeholders' goals are typically high-level, abstract, and hard-to-measure. For these reasons it would be useful to automate, as much as possible, requirements analysis. In this work we propose an automatic classification and modelling of requirements that are expressed in a natural language form, and an automatic identification of cloud services categories from requirements in order to support the development of a cloud application. Automated requirements analysis is not an easy subject, due to the natural languages variability and ambiguity, that's why different machine/deep learning and natural language processing approaches are used and compared.

The most challenging issue in current information policy models is managing security levels, mapping between access requests and defined policies and considering the flexibility and scalability of this management schema according to the characteristics of cloud computing models. Accordingly, an efficient token-based access model has been presented in this paper to provide a semantic mapping between access requests of cloud users and defined policies and sub-policies of cloud customers according to the authentication and access management protocols of protection ontology. Furthermore, a policy-based session token has been introduced to enhance the reliability of access, decrease the time of mapping by eliminating un-necessary mapping from checked policies and decrease data overhead of by classification of policies and sub-policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we propose a security aware based model for semantic search engines. Our work aims to combine advances in information technology, such as cloud technology, while addressing security issues which threaten the integrity of information. In particular security gaps and countermeasures of the semantic web are identified. {ISO}/{IEC} security requirements for the protection of personally identifiable information ({PII}) are presented to cover security vulnerabilities of the proposed model.

	abstract = {By embracing the cloud computing paradigm for storing and processing electronic medical records ({EMRs}), modern healthcare providers are able to realise significant cost savings. However, relinquishing control of sensitive medical data by delegating their storage and processing to third-party cloud providers naturally raises significant security concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise appropriate policies that infuse adequate access controls in cloud services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of these services, coupled with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinder the formulation of effective and interoperable policies that are appropriate for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work adopts the ontological templates proposed in [5] for the representation of access control policies in the medical sector. By capturing the knowledge that must be infused into an access control policy, these templates sufficiently address the needs of the underlying domain of application in which such a policy is to be enforced; at the same time, they facilitate developers in infusing adequate access controls to their cloud applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the development of an open-source information system, called Asclepios, which manages a plethora of information on communicable diseases in an agile manner. Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering ({CBSE}) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily. The application of Asclepios is wide ranging - from military to Government through to medical and tourism and pharmaceuticals. Further, Asclepios-like applications are very much needed in most Third world countries, including all countries in Africa, as it can significantly enhance the health, safety and well-being of people. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a cloud-centric framework for the implementation of the smart factory. Based on this framework, three high leveled protocols viz., {EtherCAT}, {DDS}, and {OPC} {UA} are selected to implement machine network (controller to sensors/actuators communication), machine to machine communication, and machine to cloud communication respectively, to satisfy diverse communication requirements of the smart factory. An integrated architecture for combining ontology knowledge and semantic data to support intelligent applications is also proposed.

Proving an {SLA} violation is considered to be a complex operation to the cloud consumer. This task gets more and more difficult to the consumers as they use services from multiple providers, each with its own monitoring policies. In order to implicitly help the consumer monitor the {SLA} and detect violations, it is necessary to implement some advanced {SLA} management strategies. Ontological representation and reasoning techniques in {SLA} management may be beneficial to the evaluation of the {QoS}. In this regard, we propose a monitoring approach with a new semantic {SLA} modeling for cloud computing. Our approach aims to help cloud consumers monitor the {SLA} documents and detect violations by considering the semantic meaning of {SLA} concepts and taking profit from the power of reasoning techniques. This maintains a reliable {QoS} and respects the {SLA} parameters. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in this paper through a simulation and a case study. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To manage service performance, consumers have to validate rules embedded in cloud legal contracts, such as Service Level Agreements ({SLA}) and Privacy Policies, that are available as text documents. Currently this analysis requires significant time and manual labor and is thus inefficient. We propose a cognitive assistant that can be used to manage cloud legal documents by automatically extracting knowledge (terms, rules, constraints) from them and reasoning over it to validate service performance. In this paper, we present this Question and Answering (Q\&A) system that can be used to analyze and obtain information from the {SLA} documents. We have created a knowledgebase of Cloud {SLAs} from various providers which forms the underlying repository of our Q\&A system. We utilized techniques from natural language processing and semantic web ({RDF}, {SPARQL} and Fuseki server) to build our framework. We also present sample queries on how a consumer can compute metrics such as service credit. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Platform as a Service is the major productivity enabler in the cloud computing stack. By providing managed and highly automated application environments, it enhances developer productivity and reduces developer operations and maintenance efforts. The market, however, is fast-changing and offerings are differing conceptually as well as in their supported technological ecosystem. Therefore, provider selection is an important but currently not well supported step for companies trying to benefit from the technology. Influenced by the diversity of service offerings and the absence of applied standards this is a tedious task, especially for ensuring application portability. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria selection approach for cloud platforms based on a field-tested ontology and a comprehensive data set. The methodology is enhanced by semantic algorithms and mappings to reduce hidden query and data biases. This allows not only the exact matching of requirements but also the evaluation of possible alternatives that can be adapted to fit the defined requirements. We validate our approach by contrasting real user queries against the results of our semantically enhanced algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Securing their critical documents on the cloud from data threats is a major challenge faced by organizations today. Controlling and limiting access to such documents requires a robust and trustworthy access control mechanism. In this paper, we propose a semantically rich access control system that employs an access broker module to evaluate access decisions based on rules generated using the organizations confidentiality policies. The proposed system analyzes the multi-valued attributes of the user making the request and the requested document that is stored on a cloud service platform, before making an access decision. Furthermore, our system guarantees an end-to-end oblivious data transaction between the organization and the cloud service provider using oblivious storage techniques. Thus, an organization can use our system to secure their documents as well as obscure their access pattern details from an untrusted cloud service provider. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Most current security solutions are based on perimeter security. However, Cloud computing breaks the organization perimeters. When data resides in the Cloud, they reside outside the organizational bounds. This leads users to a loos of control over their data and raises reasonable security concerns that slow down the adoption of Cloud computing. Is the Cloud service provider accessing the data? Is it legitimately applying the access control policy defined by the user? This paper presents a data-centric access control solution with enriched role-based expressiveness in which security is focused on protecting user data regardless the Cloud service provider that holds it. Novel identity-based and proxy re-encryption techniques are used to protect the authorization model. Data is encrypted and authorization rules are cryptographically protected to preserve user data against the service provider access or misbehavior. The authorization model provides high expressiveness with role hierarchy and resource hierarchy support. The solution takes advantage of the logic formalism provided by Semantic Web technologies, which enables advanced rule management like semantic conflict detection. A proof of concept implementation has been developed and a working prototypical deployment of the proposal has been integrated within Google services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A key challenge related to composition of such multi-organizational business processes and workflows is posed by the security and access control policies of the underlying organizational domains. In this paper, we propose a framework for verifying secure composability of distributed workflows in an autonomous multi-domain environment. The objective of workflow composability verification is to ensure that all the users or processes executing the designated workflow tasks conform to the time-dependent security policy specifications of all collaborating domains. A key aspect of such verification is to determine the time-dependent schedulability of distributed workflows, assumed to be invoked on a recurrent basis. We use a two-step approach for verifying secure workflow composability. In the first step, a distributed workflow is decomposed into domain-specific projected workflows and is verified for conformance with the respective domain's security and access control policy. In the second step, the cross-domain dependencies amongst the workflow tasks performed by different collaborating domains are verified. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The considerable increase in the use of cloud computing and big data solutions requires the use of advanced technologies to ensure data security, privacy and dependability. One of the possible solutions is the use of data anonymization techniques, which performs an important role in data privacy protection. There are several techniques and algorithms to implement data anonymization. However, specifications and guidelines to guide and standardize the use of these resources are needed. These guidelines, called anonymization policies, are considered an important asset in organizations that want to protect their customer personal data. Although the use of data anonymization brings great benefits, there are no clear directions for data anonymization policies, which ends up lim-iting its adoption by companies and organizations. This work presents a generic anonymization policy to be used in cloud and big data platforms. It also presents a draft ontology with explicit formal specifications for data anonymization policies. This ontology has three main intentions: (i) to standardize the use of data anonymization policies; (ii) share common understanding of the structure of data anonymization among people; (iii) enable reuse of data anonymization policies.

To ensure data confidentiality and fine-grained access control in cloud-based environments, stored data and resources needs to be re-encrypted periodically or based on special mechanisms such as revoked user-based or manual re-encryption. Managing the process of re-encryption is a challenging issue that involves many limitations such as time management, resource confidentiality, and level of access. Accordingly, a multi-level re-encryption model based on policy management has been presented in this paper to ensure data security in clouds. The proposed model uses a policy-based ontology to generate, manage and apply re-encryption policies based on the characteristics of resources, sensitivity of data and capabilities of service provider. The results of comprehensive performance and security analysis of proposed model shows this model increases the reliability of re-encryption processes in cloud storages considerably and provides an efficient policy management for re-encryption tasks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These documents are generated following a process of negotiation during which the client chooses a subset of clauses among choices predefined by the provider on a 'take it or leave it' basis. However, the heterogeneity between client requests and provider offers may result in inappropriate {SLA}. In addition, the cloud service context may change over the time which causes a client requirements adjustment and therefore, the {SLA} remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cloud {SLA} negotiation and re-negotiation approach that integrate a semantic mapping between client requests and provider offers with the aim of generating a suitable {SLA} document. Moreover, our approach includes a context-aware system to adapt the {SLA} throughout reasoning techniques and automatically ensure the re-negotiation.

However, currently, the {CABAN} paradigm in the healthcare domain is facing increasing difficulty in handling the huge amount of sensor data that the body sensor devices generate from diverse Smart home applications. Therefore, the challenging is now timely storing, processing, and analyzing of the sensor data in real time to maintain the Quality of Service ({QoS}) requirements of the caregivers or Smart home applications. {QoS}, here, is the capacity to support diverse Smart home applications in healthcare with different priorities, performance, and resource requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast and robust cloud resource allocation model for body sensor devices to ensure {QoS} for Smart home healthcare applications. We develop the proposed resource allocation algorithm using agent-based modeling ({ABM}) and ontology. There are few works, which consider {ABM} and ontology for resource allocation in {CABAN} platform. Moreover, we used an {ABM} tool called {NetLogo} to implement the proposed resource allocation model. The results from the implementation were compared with the results of existing algorithms and found to be promising. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It is critical for application service in cloud computing to provide precise information. Ontology servicing is one of the methods to deal with semantic ambiguity and information overload efficiently through appropriate semantic models and semantic technology. This system is the advanced and extended version of the system we have been published before. The experiments reveal that even the testing documents increased; the system may actually be able to produce useful result for text document clustering. In this paper, we propose a cloud service that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching. Our approach has the capability to perform cloud service concepts from cloud service sources.

	abstract = {Knowledge is a basic requirement in the era of globalization. The act of acquiring knowledge is learning and with the advent of technology, learning has become easier. E-Learning is a popular learning method which uses the web or other technologies to promote learning. A very traditional learning method is discussed and some new methods with the integration of modern technology have been discussed. Although technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, ontology, fuzzy logic etc. have been used in learning systems they are still less automated, not personalized and do not pose the capability to self-learn. A method is proposed to increase the automation and self-learning in the e-learning management systems. Further, the personalization of learning for the user so that every type of learner can learn from the type and level of the content the learner seems fit is the main aim. The proposed system is feasible, economical and scalable which makes it suitable for every level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Moreover, {SOAS} descriptions are equivalent (i.e. can be translated) to an ontology. Therefore, {SOAS} services can be easily discovered (i.e. by other services), queried by Semantic Web query languages (e.g. {SPARQL}), checked by reasoners (e.g. Pellet) for consistency or inferring new (hidden) relationships and, finally, be used by service orchestration mechanisms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Cloud computing comes in hand in this process speeding up the development and deployment of new service providers ({SPs}) and identity providers ({IdPs}) to be used into a federated environment. However, {IdPs} and {SPs} of {OpenID} Connect federations have a strong dependency on each other, they have to use the very same attribute names in order to exchange data. Our proposal lowers the dependency between {IdPs} and {SPs} using web semantics; instead of an agreement at a lower level such as attributes names, we propose that {IdPs} and {SPs} establish an agreement on the ontology to be used. Therefore, the name of attributes would not matter, but the semantic concept that attributes are associated with. Further, our proposal was added and tested into the {OpenId} Connect Implementation called {MITREid} Connect. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Lack of coincidence in identity management models based on defined policies and various security levels in different cloud servers is one of the most challenging issues in clouds. In this paper, a policy-based user authentication model has been presented to provide a reliable and scalable identity management and to map cloud users' access requests with defined polices of cloud servers. In the proposed schema several components are provided to define access policies by cloud servers, to apply policies based on a structural and reliable ontology, to manage user identities and to semantically map access requests by cloud users with defined polices. Finally, the reliability and efficiency of this policy-based authentication schema have been evaluated by scientific performance, security and competitive analysis.

The main aim of this research work consists in exploiting emerging technologies (i.e. semantic web data representation formalisms, publish-subscribe platforms) in order to (1) overcome limitations coming from the traditional paradigm of single-author workflows, (2) enhance the editing capabilities of the users, (3) ease the development and maintainment of applications and (4) provide a shared high- level abstraction of the documents that fosters information-level interoperability and reusability.

Encryption algorithm describes comparision of performance among different algorithms. The main focus of this kind of work is to present a study of cloud security policy using some encryption algorithm based on ontology.

	abstract = {Cloud software deployment, resource provisioning, monitoring and full cycle maintenance has proven to be time-consuming and complicated. While one cloud provider is good at one or a few services, other providers might be good at other services. Cloud users eventually want to consume most advantageous resources across multiple providers with the best price while avoiding vendor lock-in. Cloud users also need to safeguard their most valuable digital asset, their data, against cloud outage, which can happen to any vendor. This could mean using the same type of resources across multiple cloud providers. Moreover, cloud providers are continuously changing and evolving their services. Cloud users can only take advantage of these changes if they are able to relocate and real-locate resources using an autonomous and vendor independent tool. We propose a vendor-independent cloud provisioning tool that utilizes an ontology-based semantic reasoning to acquire the best feasible cloud resources for cloud users. In this paper, we outline an ontology subset for purchasing cloud resources or services based on price, user transaction volume, preference, quality of service and Service Layer Agreements ({SLA}). The proposed ontology is outlined in a case scenario followed by an applied algorithm for negotiating resource purchase between cloud consumer client and cloud vendor provisioning services. Such ontology can be used in inter-cloud federation {API} for monitoring and acquiring and maintaining the most advantageous cloud resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Cloud services are becoming an essential part of many organizations. Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mishmash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These, computing services, are accessed globally using thin clients and handheld devices through standard collective {GUI}, anytime, at any location upon payment of specified usage charges. This multi-ally computing utility perks up the advanced facilities to the existing assets. The security and privacy controlling of this utility (data centers, and data storage) is uniformly, vested with service patrons and suppliers, both stakeholders with shared responsibility of security implementation using multilateral relationship among them. In this paper, we propose the ontology of this vicinity, which demonstrates an interrelated layered architecture for a secured co-operative galactic computing utility. This computing architecture is proposed empirically based on our understanding and survey with various industry/academic professionals. We tried to understand the challenges they faced while using the cloud system. So, we conceptually propose this ally architecture which consists of multi-layer with multi-lateral co-operative multi-factor balanced security framework with common business interests along with shared responsibility among the stakeholders. Also we try to prove empirically multilateral balanced security which in-turn increases the strong defense measures among the multi-laterally allied bunch of users. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing enables enterprises to realise significant cost savings whilst accelerating the development of new innovative applications. Nevertheless, due to security concerns, enterprises are reluctant to migrate their operations to the cloud. In addition, the proliferation of cloud services transforms the enterprise {IT} environment into a complex ecosystem of collaborating services. One way to tame this complexity and alleviate the security concerns is to rely on policies that regulate the deployment, delivery and governance of cloud services. However, the heterogeneity inherent in such services, coupled with the dynamic nature of cloud environments, hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable policies. This paper proposes a generic framework for the definition and representation of policies that are enforceable across diverse administrative domains and are amenable to automated correctness checks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We propose a private data disclosure checking method that can be applied to the collaboration interaction process. First, we describe the privacy requirement with ontology and description logic. Second, with dynamic description logic, we validate whether {SaaS} services are authorized to obtain a user's privacy attributes, to prevent unauthorized services from obtaining their private data. Third, we monitor authorized {SaaS} services to guarantee privacy requirements. Therefore, we can prevent users' private data from being used and propagated illegally. Finally, we propose privacy disclosure checking algorithms, and demonstrate their correctness and feasibility by experiments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, service trading over the Web is gaining momentum. In this highly dynamic scenario, both providers and consumers need to formalize their contractual and legal relationship, creating service level agreements. Although there exist some proposals that provide models to describe that relationship, they usually only cover technical aspects, not providing explicit semantics to the agreement terms. Furthermore, these models cannot be effectively shared on the Web, since they do not actually follow Web principles. These drawbacks hamper take-up and automatic analysis. In this article, we introduce Linked {USDL} Agreement, a semantic model to specify, manage and share service level agreement descriptions on the Web. This model is part of the Linked {USDL} family of ontologies that can describe not only technical but also business related aspects of services, incorporating Web principles. We validate our proposal by describing agreements in computational and non-computational scenarios, namely cloud computing and business process outsourcing services. Moreover, we evaluate the actual coverage and expressiveness of Linked {USDL} Agreement comparing it with existing models. In order to foster its adoption and effectively manage the service level agreement lifecycle, we present an implemented tool that supports creation, automatic analysis, and publication on the Web of agreement descriptions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The industry is constantly moving towards the research, implementation and deployment of new solutions that permit the optimization of processes. Nowadays, such solutions consist mostly on {ICT} developments, which permit the collection, distribution, integration, analysis, and manipulation of heterogeneous data. The under way Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project targets the development of cloud-enabled tools for supporting the {SMEs} supply network optimization of manufacturing and logistic assets. The C2NET solution includes the implementation of paradigms as e.g. cloud computing or service-oriented and event-driven architectures, used for wide data integration. Among its requirements, the C2NET platform needs a solution for catch, process and react to events triggered in different locations of collaborative manufacturing networks, which are endowed with devices that permits the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems ({CPS}). This paper presents the architecture and main functionality of a knowledge-based approach that allows processing supply chain events handled by {CPS} devices. The main component of the presented solution is the {SECA} ontology, which is a knowledge base that can be updated at runtime. The main purpose of the ontology is to describe events, their status and the actions to be performed once a set of events are triggered in certain order. This research work offers a solution that can be employed by the C2NET platform not only to catch and process events; but also to notify linked data consumers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work proposes to include security and privacy into to context of Linked Open Data ({LOD}) and the Semantic Web. Here, a database partitioning approach to logically and physically separate data and distribute the partitions across several different cloud providers is applied. This data distribution is called fixed vertical partitioning and distribution approach ({FVPD}), as data schemes are vertically partitioned and distributed across various different cloud providers. Hence, this framework uses a security-by-distribution approach to storing sensitive data securely and privacy-ware in all possible cloud deployment models and thus, it provides a solution to improve the level of security and privacy. The proposed {FVPD} approach also becomes viable in the context of {LOD} and the Semantic Web. Furthermore, in relevant literature no approach in this context has been dealing with security and privacy so far. Therefore, this work transfers the {FVPD} approach from relational databases to Semantic Web Frameworks (Apache Jena, Sesame, etc.) that provide storage engines for {RDF} data and corresponding {SPARQL} endpoints. Above that, the query performance of such a federated environment is compared to a non-partitioned and non-distributed environment. For this, an adapted version of the {TPC}-W benchmark is used. Thus, this work shows how the query performance is affected when relational database data are exposed as {SPARQL} endpoints in {RDF}-based form and how the {FVPD} approach influences the query performance. Finally, it illustrates a mechanism to improve the level of security and privacy through a security-by-distribution approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing technology is a new paradigm which provides Information Technology ({IT}) resources via the Internet. This new shift in the way that {IT} re-sources are offered to the user brings new challenges, such as cloud service discovery. Nowadays, cloud users are faced with a dilemma as they have an abundant choice of cloud services. Moreover, many cloud providers offer a range of services which deliver similar functionality. Locating the best and most appropriate cloud service with a suitable and capable provider is a primary concern for any consumer. In order to clearly comprehend the scope of this problem, a thorough analysis of the limitations of cloud service discovery approaches is required which, in turn, will empower researchers to deliver better solutions for consumers to make an informed decision and choose the right service. This paper presents an overview of the current cloud service discovery trends and challenges in recent studies. Additionally, the reviewed approaches are classified according to service discovery architecture and techniques. Furthermore, these approaches are compared and analysed from several perspectives including approach model/architecture, service type, ontology representation (domain, language, and reasoning), dynamic discovery model, evaluation model, user's preferences techniques, data updates, and public repositories. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In cloud computing, searchable encryption scheme over outsourced data is a hot research field. However, most existing works on encrypted search over outsourced cloud data follow the model of 'one size fits all' and ignore personalized search intention. Moreover, most of them support only exact keyword search, which greatly affects data usability and user experience. So how to design a searchable encryption scheme that supports personalized search and improves user search experience remains a very challenging task. In this paper, for the first time, we study and solve the problem of personalized multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data ({PRSE}) while preserving privacy in cloud computing. With the help of semantic ontology {WordNet}, we build a user interest model for individual user by analyzing the user's search history, and adopt a scoring mechanism to express user interest smartly. To address the limitations of the model of 'one size fit all' and keyword exact search, we propose two {PRSE} schemes for different search intentions. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate our analysis and show that our proposed solution is very efficient and effective. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Understanding the risk classification is an important hemisphere for operating cybersecurity insurance. However, the classification representation will be complicated when the service system becomes large. Improper presentation of the risks can result in financial loss or operational mistakes. This paper addresses this concern and proposes an approach using ontology-based knowledge representation for cybersecurity insurance. The approach is named as Semantic Cyber Incident Classification ({SCIC}) model, which uses knowledge representation deriving from semantic techniques.

This increasing participating on the web necessitates that robust and efficient cyber security systems need to be put in place by these entities to safeguard their cyber assets. Intelligent Systems needs to be employed to buttress the cyber security protocols established in cloud computing for proper decision-making, which may depend on the effective knowledge representation. However, as one of the dominant industry standards for knowledge representation, Web Ontology Language ({OWL}) has limitations, such as the lack of support for custom relations. Pace University has extended {OWL} to support Knowledge Graph as a replacement to better support knowledge representation and decision making.

We have investigated how health posts and pharmacies could promote self-care in developing countries. We have restricted ourselves on the ways these organizations could assist patients in exploiting health-oriented network services such as Personal Health Records ({PHRs}) and public medical data sources. Our ultimate goal is to promote information therapy (Ix) as it aims to prescribe the right information to right people at right time. In our solution, Ix is carried out by a {SPARQL} engine, which is capable for accessing {PHRs} and other medical data sources within a query. Thus we can augment patient's data in {PHR} by external data sources. Such automatic augmentation is based on the overlapping ontologies that model {PHRs}' data as well the data in public medical data sources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the existing {RDF} database engines are not scalable and are less reliable in heterogeneous clouds. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Acacia-{RDF} which is a scalable distributed {RDF} graph database engine developed with X10 programming language to solve this issue. Acacia-{RDF} partitions the {RDF} data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable {SPARQL} processor for Acacia-{RDF} which operates on top of partitioned {RDF} data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the implementation of scalable graph algorithms such as Triangle counting with such partitioned data sets. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of {LUBM} {RDF} benchmark data sets and make a comparison of Acacia's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-{RDF} scales well with {LUBM} data sets. Acacia-{RDF} reported approximately 2 seconds elapsed time on 4 places for running the first and third queries of the {LUBM} benchmark on {LUBM} scale 40 data set. Through this work we introduce the use of X10 language for scalable {RDF} graph data management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, cloud computing is an emerging technology thanks to its ability to provide on-demand computing services (hardware and software) with less description standardization effort. Multiple issues and challenges in discovering cloud services appear due to the lack of the cloud service description standardization. In fact, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services while proposing ontologies. However, since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology ({CSO}), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. This paper contribution is threefold. First, it specifies a set of patterns and anti-patterns in order to evaluate {CSO}. Second, it defines an anti-pattern detection method based on {SPARQL} queries which provides a set of correction recommendations to help ontologists revise the ontology. Finally, some experiment tests were conducted in relation to: (i) the method efficiency and (ii) anti-pattern detection of design anomalies as well as taxonomic and domain errors within {CSO}. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this paper we explain a workflow and the results of a benchmark that examines which Linked Data storage solution and setup should be chosen for different dataset sizes to optimize the cost-effectiveness of the entire {ETL} process. The benchmark executes diversified stress tests on the storage solutions. The results include an in-depth analysis of four mature Linked Data solutions with commercial support and full {SPARQL} 1.1 compliance. Whereas traditional benchmarks studies generally deploy the triple stores on premises using high-end hardware, this benchmark uses publicly available cloud machine images for reproducibility and runs on commodity hardware. All stores are tested using their default configuration. In this setting Virtuoso shows the best performance in general. The other tree stores show competitive results and have disjunct areas of excellence. Finally, it is shown that each store's performance heavily depends on the structural properties of the queries, giving an indication of where vendors can focus their optimization efforts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing environment is influenced by user-dependent quality of service ({QoS}) parameters in evaluating the performance of Web services apart from others factors. Among the performance {QoS} parameters, mainly response-time and throughput could be modulated to provide very efficient services for cloud users. As per user's requirement, the service provider's recommendation of appropriate Web services to the end-users with proper {QoS} satisfaction is one of the critical issues. This can be recommended to end-users in the Service Level Agreement ({SLA}) under Web Service Modeling Ontology ({WSMO}) of {WS}-Policy. Generally, the matrix of collected {QoS} parameter values is sparse and the accurate prediction of the missing {QoS} values is important for the recommendation of appropriate web services to the end users. To address this issue, we worked out an artificial neural network model for the prediction of missing {QoS}-values using past {QoS} performance parameter data. In this current work, the performances of different learning algorithms of {ANN} are analyzed for enhanced prediction of {QoS} performance values. The {ANN} model with Bayesian-Regularization is found to be better performing when compared to other learning algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cloud monitoring is of a source of big data that are constantly produced from traces of infrastructures, platforms, and applications. Analysis of monitoring data delivers insights of the system's workload and usage pattern and ensures workloads are operating at optimum levels. The analysis process involves data query and extraction, data analysis, and result visualization. Since the volume of monitoring data is big, these operations require a scalable and reliable architecture to extract, aggregate, and analyze data in an arbitrary range of granularity. Ultimately, the results of analysis become the knowledge of the system and should be shared and communicated. This paper presents our cloud service architecture that explores a search cluster for data indexing and query. We develop {REST} {APIs} that the data can be accessed by different analysis modules. This architecture enables extensions to integrate with software frameworks of both batch processing (such as Hadoop) and stream processing (such as Spark) of big data. The analysis results are structured in Semantic Media Wiki pages in the context of the monitoring data source and the analysis process. This cloud architecture is empirically assessed to evaluate its responsiveness when processing a large set of data records under node failures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Applying cloud systems enables healthcare users to obtain medical information from multiple cloud-based platforms or sources. Various service deployments meet different customers' needs. As one of the popular information sharing manners on clouds, Online Self-Diagnosis ({OSD}) has been widely implemented for recommending medicines or treatment plans in the varied medical fields. However, there is a great risk for users when executing {OSD} since lack of professional pharmacological knowledge. This paper concentrates on this issue and proposes an ontology-based approach representing the medical knowledge for alarming potential risks. The proposed mechanism is named Secure Ontology-based Self-diagnosis ({SOS}) Model that is designed to generate knowledge of medical treatments or incompatibility of medicines to avoid improper behaviors of diagnoses. Based on the proposed model, our algorithm uses structure-level technique applying semantic schemas, which is Propositional Satisfiability Matching Algorithm ({PSMA}).

In this paper, we designed ontological models for healthcare workflow and multi-tenancy, and then applied {HIPAA} requirements on the models to generate {HIPAA}-compliant access control policies. We used Semantic Web Rule Language ({SWRL}) to represent access control policies as rules, and we verified the rules with an {OWL}-{DL} reasoner. Additionally, we implemented {HIPAA} security rules through access control policies in a cloud-based simulated healthcare environment. More specifically, we investigated access control policy specification and enforcement for cloud based healthcare information systems using an open source cloud platform, {OpenStack}.

	abstract = {Despite its attractive benefits, cloud adoption is challenged by some criteria of security and privacy. Access Control is one of the traditional and essential security tools of data protection. The decision to grant access to a resource must ensure secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In particular, the challenge is more important with public clouds as many governing authorities could be involved in one cloud scenario. This implies a difficulty to work out which regulation should be applicable in case of conflict. In recent years, many access control models were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their security policies specification and enforcement. In this paper, we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies for the context of public cloud. Throughout the use of ontology tools, we propose an approach for checking privacy enforcement with access control conditions. We also suggest the use of privacy safeguards notification where the threat to privacy protection is related to the secondary usage of personal data more than just the data access itself. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

One of the major benefits of using {EHR} systems is assisting physicians to gain patients' healthcare information and shorten the process of the medical decision making. However, physicians' inputs still have a great impact on making decisions that cannot be checked by {EHR} systems. This consequence can be influenced by human behaviors or physicians' knowledge structures. An efficient approach of alerting to the unusual decisions is an urgent requirement for current {EHR} systems. This paper proposes a schema using ontology in big data to generate an alerting mechanism to assist physicians to make a proper medical diagnosis. The proposed model is Ontology-based {EHR} Error Prevention Model ({OEHR}-{EPM}), which is implemented by a proposed algorithm, Error Prevention Adjustment Algorithm ({EPAA}). The ontological approach uses Protege to represent the knowledge-based ontology. The proposed schema has been examined by our experiments and the experimental results show that our schema has a higher-level accuracy rate and acceptable operating time performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Cloudle, which is the most recent agent-based and semantic-supported search engine in cloud systems, exploits such techniques. Though many models and architectures have been proposed to develop Cloudle, none of them used formal methods for composing services.

	abstract = {Over the past few years, cloud computing has been more and more attractive as a new computing paradigm due to high flexibility for provisioning on-demand computing resources that are used as services through the Internet. In cloud computing, the unique characteristics in cloud services such as dynamic and diverse services offered at different levels, together with the lack of standardized description languages pose significant challenges for effective cloud service discovery. In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service categories to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching in real environments. Our approach has the capability to automatically identify and categorize cloud services by detecting cloud service concepts from cloud service sources. Initially, we focus on building the cloud service ontology by using {NIST} ({US} National Institute of Standards and Technology). Then, we utilize our cloud service categorization method to investigate cloud service ontology's concepts in a real-world cloud services dataset which contains the metadata of 5,883 real cloud services. After that, we generate cloud service clusters by using cosine similarity to build the cloud service categorization. Our cloud service categorization is helpful in determining whether a given web source is a cloud service. Furthermore, the new web resource which has been categorized as a cloud service can be used to boost knowledge of cloud service categorization cumulatively. The proposed approach is validated by using real-world cloud services available on the World Wide Web and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in cloud service discovery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Scientists gain benefits from scalable resource provisioning on-demand, and various computing environments by using cloud computing resources for their applications. However, many cloud computing providers offer their cloud resources according to their own rules. The descriptions of various cloud resources also differ for each vendor. Subsequently, it becomes difficult to find suitable cloud resources given the characteristics of an application. Scientists therefore, select resources used in previous experiments or best performance resources without considering the characteristics of their applications. There is the need to standardize notations to support simple selection of cloud resources without the constraints of providers. Intercloud can use cloud resources without considering cloud providers in hybrid cloud environments. Intercloud project has been studied for interoperability and creates {mOSAIC} ontology to conceptualize various resources. However, the {mOSAIC} ontology attributes are limited when considering characteristics of an application. We propose a semantic engine to provide semantic cloud resource services in intercloud environment. We define a rule of categorized resource description with reference to {mOSAIC} ontology attributes which includes added factors needed to represent application characteristics. We also develop a semantic engine which can choose semantically similar cloud resources using statistical analysis while considering the characteristics of an application. The semantic engine can also classify resources dynamically according to application specifications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This allows research collaborators within a knowledge domain to easily run complex applications developed by researchers within the domain on complex datasets. Both batch-type processing as well as interactive application access are supported by the platform. The processing of live data streams generated in one site by an application residing in another site can also be performed. An authorization framework allows element owners to precisely control which users can access various elements. {RP}-{SMARF} unifies geographically dispersed heterogeneous resources for research collaborators.

To address this issue, this paper proposes the use of Semantic Web concepts to avoid cloud lock-in. The strategy consists of using {RDF} models to specify the features of a cloud service, which are managed by {SPARQL} queries. The contribution of this paper is fourfold: (i) to evaluate three multi-cloud solutions for the cloud lock-in problem in the context of three cloud platforms, (ii) to propose a strategy using {RDF} and {SPARQL} for managing cloud resources, (iii) to present the Cloud Query Manager ({CQM}), an {SPARQL} server that implements the proposal, and (vi) to compare three multi-cloud solutions with {CQM} in terms of response time and the effectiveness in the resolution of the cloud lock-in problem. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Hence a way to provide a common access to Cloud services and to discover and use required services in Cloud federations is highly desirable.

However, today's {BPaaS} solutions lack an explicit and formal semantics which prevent an easy and dynamic interoperability between different cloud providers. In this paper, we propose firstly to semantically populate a shared knowledge base of process models deployed by {BPaaS} providers. Therefore, using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve similar process fragments that can be used to design new process variants. We also performed experiments on large public datasets and experimental results show that our approach is feasible and efficient. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Despite agreement on that the transformation of business model is importance to an organization's success, the evolution of business model enabled by Cloud is still fuzzy and vague within many research fields including both Management Strategy Theory and Information Systems. This paper, following a review of existing works and a series of case studies from several typical industries, employs a deductive reasoning method to investigate the influence of cloud computing on business model evolution and presents a specific service-centric business model. First, the evolution of business model in cloud environment is developed. Second, by analyzing business model innovations on business model nine building blocks in cloud environment, the element of service-centric business model is defined. Then, an ontological framework which includes value, service, and business model dimension for service-centric innovative business model is proposed. Finally, several industrial cases validate that this paper provides a comprehensive framework of organization's business model which can properly reveals an organization's complex nature of business logic and operation management in cloud environment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, current proposals to model service level agreements are mostly focused on technical aspects, do not explicitly provide semantics to agreement terms, and do not follow Web principles. These limitations prevent take-up, automatic processing, and effective sharing of agreements. Linked {USDL} Agreement is a Linked Data based semantic model to describe and share service agreements that extends Linked {USDL}, which offers a family of languages to describe various technical and business aspects of services. We followed a use case driven approach, evaluating the applicability of our proposal in a cloud computing scenario, and comparing its expressiveness with existing models. Finally, we show a concrete tool that helps to model and check the validity of agreements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The main idea is that all Cloud components offer their functions as a service. For this reason Cloud systems inherits many features from old Web Services and Service Oriented architectures. At the moment, the need for composition and automation of Cloud services is a hot research field. Orchestration is one of the topics that researchers are investigating. Unlike web services, it is not clear what orchestration means in Cloud Systems. It usually addresses automation, but no clear definitions and languages have been provided. Another hot topic regarding composition of cloud services is the definition of design, architectural and communication Patterns for solving well known and common problems. In this work we will show how Orchestration and some Patterns are tightly coupled. We will describe a methodology for definition of orchestrated workflows which exploits some common Cloud Design Patterns in order to verify composition soundness. In addition we will show how this methodology can be used to verify some requirements on the composed Cloud services. The whole methodology is based both on formal semantics definition of an Orchestration language, and on the use of Ontologies for the description of Cloud services interactions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper proposes a semantically-enabled compliance management framework that backs up the entire business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design-time verification, runtime and offline monitoring and analysis. In the heart of the framework is an integrated semantic repository incorporating domain, business and regulatory knowledge, at different levels of abstraction, which provides a shared conceptualization of the interrelated compliance and business specifics. Furthermore, given the technological revolution caused by cloud computing, we draw our vision on providing compliance-related ontologies as a service ({COaaS}) on the cloud.

	abstract = {Advances in the field of cloud computing and networking have led to rapid development and market growth in areas such as online retail, gaming and healthcare. In the field of advanced manufacturing however, the impact has been significantly lesser than expected due to limitations in cloud platforms for fostering community engagement. To address this problem, we study a new cloud-based architecture that provides Platform-asa-Service ({PaaS}) management capabilities to the manufacturing community for delivering Software-as-a-Service ({SaaS}) 'Apps' to their customers. Our architecture aims at supporting an 'App Marketplace' that thrives on agile development, organic collaboration and scalable sales of next generation manufacturing Apps requiring high-performance simulation and modeling. Towards realizing the vision of the above architecture, our paper involves investigation and implementation of an Ontology Service that interoperates with other common web services related to resource brokering and accounting. Our Ontology Service uses principles of mapping and merging to translate a manufacturing App's collaboration requirements to suitable resource specifications on public cloud platforms. Integrated resultant ontology can be queried to provision the required resource parameters such as amount of memory/storage, number of processing units, and network protocol configurations needed for deployment of an App. We validate the effectiveness of our Ontology Service using the Protégé framework in a pilot testbed of a real-world '{WheelSim}' App in the {NSF} {GENI} Cloud platform. Our ontology integration results show benefits to an App developer in terms of: optimal user experience, lower design time and lower cost/simulation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Nowadays, depending on online networks popularity, there are a lot of research starting to focus on patient-context to apply health care fields like tele-health, tele-care, medical traveling, and so on. The proposed {eHeaRSS} is like a family doctor to care patients, especially to use generated patients-context. {eHeaRSS} is a recommendation system for immediate and appropriate medical services using crowd sourcing in cloud computing environment. To do this, it is necessary to classify the data into symptoms, diseases, departments and doctors related data types. To consider hierarchies or subsume relationships among them, {eHeaRSS} Ontology ({eHeaRSS}-Ont) is developed through integration of 4-static ontology (4-Ont) which is comprised of symptom-, disease-, department-and doctor-Ont to create tailored recommendations depending on patient-context. For the recommendation service, Case-based reasoning ({CBR}) is applied. The extracted cases using 4-Ont are integrated by {eHeaRSS}-Ont depending on the patient-context. For customization, it is necessary to reconfigure the case using {eHeaRSS} Constraints Value Compatibility Map ({eHeaRSS}-{CVCM}). To prove the significance and efficiency of the {eHeaRSS}, we experimented using ontology-based data processing and proved the superiority of {eHeaRSS} with the provision of better recommendation than other {DB}-based systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The term "trust" in the area of cloud computing has always been one of the most problematic issues. The cloud user becomes willing to accept insecure conditions and unconsciously increases these conditions' security level if he is able to find a strategy that provides trust. This level of trust, once established, is difficult to maintain if any deception takes place. The indications of proven trust can only be seen in future usage of a cloud service. For this reason, specific control instruments are required to ascertain the accuracy of one's trust. The establishment of trust in a public cloud environment requires a paradigm change: a holistic strategy that enforces regulation requirements throughout the cloud architecture. The movement of the root of trust into hardware reduces vulnerability to compromise, as hardware attacks require a high expenditure of time and effort. Cloud users would define regulation standards through trust-worthy {IT} instruments and enforce them in specific cloud-service layers. The extension of this approach is the regulation of {SaaS}-based applications to enforce requirements for separation and availability. This work introduces a conceptual approach to establish a chain of policy by using hardware-oriented root of trust. The conceptual description of a chain of policy outlines the main principles to enforce regulations accurately for each architectural cloud layer based on an established chain of trust. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Similar to the situation with service providers in the 1980th, it becomes apparent that different Cloud providers build walled gardens around their offerings. While multiple projects and organizations are working on standards for federating Cloud domains, the scalable exchange of descriptions about heterogeneous resources are often not well considered. Our approach is to adopt both, ideas initially developed for the Internet to defne a scalable architecture and concepts from the Semantic Web to defne a canonical Intercloud ontology. An initial implementation of the architecture has been developed to form a basis for further refnement of the proposed concepts. As a result, we have defned an initial ontology for Intercloud resources and implemented a catalog for the {IEEE} Intercloud architecture. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It aims to build a digital education mechanism and system platform based on cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology, and achieve accurate matching of vocational education with industry needs by establishing an education model of "data-driven-intelligent adaptation-dynamic feedback". First, crawler technology is used to integrate 46,000 cloud computing job recruitment data and 32 vocational college teaching data to construct a job capability knowledge graph; secondly, learner portraits are classified based on the K-means clustering algorithm, and a dynamic evaluation system containing 8 dimensions and 64 indicators is established; then a system architecture with three core functions of intelligent course recommendation, virtual training environment, and real-time capability assessment is designed, and an {LSTM} neural network is introduced for learning behavior prediction. Within a 12-month period of three pilot colleges, the system enables learners to achieve a job adaptation rate of 85.2\%, a mean resource allocation delay of 9.24ms, and an employment rate of 92.5\%, which verifies the remarkable effect of this mechanism in improving the adaptability of vocational education and provides a replicable technical path for vocational education reform under the background of digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Based on the diversified application scenarios at Ant Group, we built the Ant Knowledge Graph Platform ({AKGP}). It has constructed numerous domain-specific knowledge graphs related to merchants, companies, accounts, products, and more. {AKGP} manages trillions of structured knowledge graphs, serving search, recommendation, risk control and other businesses. However, as the demand increasing for various workloads such as graph pattern matching, graph representation learning, and cross-domain knowledge reuse, the existing warehouse systems based on relational {DBMS} or graph databases are unable to meet the requirements. To address these issues, we propose {KGFabric}, an industrial-scale knowledge graph management system built on the distributed file system ({DFS}). {KGFabric} offers a nearline knowledge storage engine that utilizes a Semantic-enhanced Programmable Graph ({SPG}) model, which is compatible with the Labeled Property Graph ({LPG}) model. The data is persistently stored in {DFS}, such as {HDFS}, which leverages the {POSIX} file system {API}, making it suitable for deployment in multi-cloud environment at low cost. {KGFabric} provides a native graph-based and hybrid storage format that can serve as a shared backend for parallel graph computing systems, significantly accelerating the analysis of multi-workload. Additionally, {KGFabric} includes a graph fabric framework that minimizes data duplication and guarantees data security.{KGFabric} is able to manage Peta-scale data and has supported graph fabric and analysis with over 100 billion relations at Ant Group. We conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate the performance of {KGFabric}. Compared with popular relational {DBMS} and graph databases, the storage space for semantic relations is reduced by over 90\%. The performance of graph fabric improves by 21× in real-world workloads. In multi-hop semantic graph analysis, {KGFabric} enhances performance by 100×.},

The benchmark executes diversified stress tests on the storage solutions. The results include an in-depth analysis of four mature Linked Data solutions with commercial support and full {SPARQL} 1.1 compliance. Whereas traditional benchmarks studies generally deploy the triple stores on premises using high-end hardware, this benchmark uses publicly available cloud machine images for reproducibility and runs on commodity hardware. All stores are tested using their default configuration. In this setting Virtuoso shows the best performance in general. The other tree stores show competitive results and have disjunct areas of excellence. Finally, it is shown that each store's performance heavily depends on the structural properties of the queries, giving an indication of where vendors can focus their optimization efforts.},

Unregulated and rampant collection of user and usage data by applications led to concerns on privacy, trust, and ethics. This has resulted in several governments and organizations across geographies to frame laws on data (e.g., the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ({GDPR})) that govern and define boundaries for the storage, processing and transitioning of data; and thereby safeguard the interests of its citizens. Data Sovereignty and Data Localization are two important aspects, which deal with the adherence to the laws and governance structures, that define where and how data is collected and processed. The applicability of different laws depends upon several attributes such as the nature, type, and purpose of data. Non-compliance to laws/regulations can lead to serious repercussions for enterprises, ranging from hefty penalties to loss of brand value. Ensuring that all of their applications are complaint to various laws and regulations is non-trivial. Enterprises have to deal with a plethora of laws (that are constantly evolving) and are often confused even in correctly identifying all the applicable laws for their context leave alone ensuring compliance to regulations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a knowledge graph based data sovereignty governance framework that assists in classifying data and in identifying the relevant applicable laws.},

We present a dynamic scheduling system for multi-module cloud course resources using deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, a knowledge graph and conceptualization ability model are constructed to evaluate students' knowledge mastery levels. The dynamic demands are modeled as Markov Decision Processes, and optimized matching strategies are derived via deep Q-learning to satisfy personalized requirements. A reward function is designed to maximize students' knowledge conceptualization ability. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. This work provides a new intelligent solution to adaptively schedule cloud course resources.

Institutions and labs can install and customize their own instance of the framework on local hardware or on remote cloud computing resources to provide a shared service to distributed communities of researchers. Data can be ingested directly from instruments or manually uploaded by users and then shared with remote collaborators using a web front end. We discuss some of the challenges encountered in designing and developing a system that can be easily adapted to different scientific areas including digital preservation, geoscience, material science, medicine, social science, cultural heritage and the arts. Some of these challenges include support for large amounts of data, horizontal scaling of domain specific preprocessing algorithms, ability to provide new data visualizations in the web browser, a comprehensive Web service {API} for automatic data ingestion and curation, a suite of social annotation and metadata management features to support data annotation by communities of users and algorithms, and a web based front-end to interact with code running on heterogeneous clusters, including {HPC} resources.},

	abstract = {Mobile cloud computing ({MCC}) has attracted more and more attention from both Small and Medium Enterprises ({SMEs}). {MCC} provides access to cloud services for mobile devices. With the growing popularity of smart mobile devices, customers need efficient and new high quality services. In this context, mobile {ERP} services management and adaptation at real time are becoming a challenging task. However, it is necessary to handle in a dynamic intelligent and transparent platform various mobile cloud services provided by multiple cloud providers with several qualities. This paper presents {CloudCxQERP} platform, which is a cloud-based semantic platform for dynamic management of context-aware mobile {ERP} applications. It is based on semantic web technologies and cloud computing and provides fast {ERP} development process and "an ecosystem" of enterprises that ensures quality customer service. Moreover, our platform provides a middleware that offers to users more efficient services corresponding to current situations and adapts its {ERP} applications more quickly and cost effectively. Experiments are based on online packaging boxes services.},
