Nagar","An Integrated Knowledge Graph to Automate Cloud Data Compliance","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3008964","","To address data protection concerns, authorities and standards bodies worldwide have released a plethora of regulations, guidelines, and software controls to be applied to Cloud data. As a result, service providers maintaining their end-user's private attributes have seen a surge in compliance requirements. Since most of these regulations are not available in a machine-processable format, it requires significant manual effort to adhere to them. Often many of the laws have overlapping rules, but as they are not referencing each other, providers must duplicate efforts to comply with each regulation. We have done a detailed study of all the data protection regulations that apply to Cloud data. We have developed an integrated, semantically rich knowledge graph that captures these various data compliance regulations. It includes the data threats and security controls that are needed to mitigate the risks. In this paper, we present this knowledge graph in detail, along with the system that we have developed to evaluate it. We have validated our knowledge graph against the privacy policies of various Cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, IBM, and Rackspace. This knowledge graph is available in the public domain and can be used by organizations to automate their compliance processes and set their enterprise Cloud security policies.","2020","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","148541-148555","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; cloud security; Data protection; cloud security models; security compliance models; security domains; Standards; Regulation; Data models; Cloud computing security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data security of multiple cloud-based services is also susceptible to these threats, due to the high dependency on traditional routing protocols. Although a number of hijacking detection techniques have been recently proposed, no existing system has effectively addressed the problem of detecting malicious transit Autonomous System (AS) services in any detected hijacking occurrences. The ability to locate and isolate malicious services is critical for conducting a necessary mitigation strategy at an early stage, to minimise the impact of the attack, to restore cloud services quickly. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time processing method, so-called Ontological Graph Identification (OGI), for detecting IP prefix hijacking of nodes and suspicious transit nodes caused by the hijacked nodes through ASs. The proposed method is evaluated using the two public datasets of RIPE RIS and RouteView. Experimental results revealed improved performance for the detection of malicious transit nodes compared with peer techniques. It is, therefore, shown that the proposed method has utility in automating the process of investigating nodes with suspicious activities in real network systems.","2020","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","1164-1174","","","15","","IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; anomaly detection; Autonomous systems; BGP hijacking; IP networks; IP prefix hijacking; network systems; Peer-to-peer computing; Periodic structures; Routing; Real-time systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To effectively manage and integrate security requirements in the cloud, the provider and customer needs to negotiate and agree upon the applied security policies. However, there is no standard way of expressing cloud security policies in a vendor-agnostic manner. Cloud security and privacy policies are often stated in an informal and ad-hoc manner, which leads to policy conflicts, incompleteness, ambiguity and inconsistencies. In this paper, we present CERBERUS, a framework for representing cloud security and privacy policies and detecting potential problems in the policies. CERBERUS adopts an object-oriented approach and consists of an ontology and notation, policies, guidelines and rules, and a tool for capturing and detecting policy errors. Using CERBERUS, policies can be analyzed for potential problems, including policy conflicts, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness. An application of CERBERUS shows that it indeed helps to discover policy errors, which otherwise would go undetected or in many cases would be detected a posteriori at runtime.","2019-11-18","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","214-221","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE 5th International Conference on Big Data Intelligence and Computing (DATACOM)","","","","Ontologies; Data privacy; Privacy; cloud security and privacy; security policy; Runtime; Organizations; Standards organizations; Cloud computing security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE 5th International Conference on Big Data Intelligence and Computing (DATACOM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, security risks remain major concerns. One of the main challenges is how to evaluate the security level of cloud services. Among the problems arising are the large variety of knowledge associated with the security domain and the heterogeneity of cloud services descriptions. An effective solution to such problems is ontologies. Ontologies provide a more structured and formal representation of a particular domain, which will help to reduce the conceptual ambiguity and enable automatic reasoning functionalities. In this paper, we propose an ontology for cloud services security evaluation based on industry standards and best practices. Some of the core concepts included in the ontology are the target, criteria, yardstick, data gathering techniques and data synthesis approaches. The concepts are grouped into five general categories, namely: context, assumptions, external factors, activities, and outcomes. The ontology is implemented using Protégé tool and validated through different uses case scenarios.","2019-12-20","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","1012-1018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE 4th Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC)","","","","Cloud computing; cloud computing; Security; Ontologies; NIST; ontologies; security evaluation; security ontologies; services evaluation; Measurement; Computational modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE 4th Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the development of big data with high dimensionality, data storage possibility over cloud has created large scope in recent times. Document clustering is the fundamental topic that turned into an indispensable component in many areas like cloud computing. Document clustering partitions the document into significant classes or groups for retrieving the relevant document. Many researchers used the factorization methods and ontologies for internal and external knowledge based document clustering. However, existing methods failed to provide the semantic feature construction and leads to the information loss while covering all the ideas in documents. In order to address these problems, different document clustering techniques in cloud has been reviewed in this paper. In addition to that Document clustering by Entropy-based Boosting with Projection Neural Feature (EB-PNF) method is presented. The proposed method involves two stages. They are, similar document identification based on semantic similarity score, feature extraction which includes the extraction of both single and multi-label features based on the precision, recall and computational complexity to prove that EB-PNF method produces high-quality clusters comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.","2019-11-27","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","1163-1169","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)","","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontologies; Clustering algorithms; Feature extraction; ontologies; Boosting; dimensionality; Document clustering; Entropy; factorization; Projection Neural Feature; semantic feature; Databases; Computational complexity; Clustering methods; Smart systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, a uniform description of Cloud services would be needed. The aim of this study is to provide a new ontology for uniform description of Cloud services coming from heterogeneous sources. The proposed model takes into account the different relationships and dependencies between services across Cloud's layers. These dependencies are represented by the different constraints of composition and deployment. To validate our proposal, qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted. The qualitative evaluation is carried out by making comparisons with both state-of-the-art works and the Bitnami platform according to some criteria.

Since there is no standard about Cloud service description or publication, therefore a key requirement that every Cloud provider needs to take into consideration is efficient management of resources and services by providing automated solutions, for a better service publication and discovery. The proposed approach aims to manage Cloud SaaS services for an efficient publication by classifying them into sets according to their domain to reduce the search space then interconnected the SaaS services of the same domain in a Semantic Network using the similarity measure (Input/Output similarity) between concepts.

While several tools exist for providing semantic annotation to web documents, the techniques used in these tools vary very widely. Also, the mode of implementation and the solutions offered by the tools are inconsistent with each other leaving end users confused on the appropriate tool for use to deliver their expected results. Based on these, a holistic perspective to the development of semantic annotation tools as well as their implementation is necessary. This is to ensure uniformity in the expected end results and guarantee a continuous, dynamic and consistent semantic annotation for web documents; encompassing the complete needs of end users. To achieve this, cloud computing is proposed for the delivery of semantic annotation as a holistic service, as it provides an enabling environment for processing the vast amount of data required to annotate web documents. Also, cloud computing essential characteristics such as ubiquitous network access, rapid elasticity and on-demand self-service are very necessary to achieve a holistic semantic annotation service for documents on the web. This paper presents a cloud-driven framework to facilitate the delivery of a holistic semantic annotation on the web.","2018-10-15","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","128-134","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 Fifth International Conference on Social Networks Analysis, Management and Security (SNAMS)","","","","Cloud Computing; Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontologies; Metadata; Semantic Annotation; Cloud-Driven; Servers; Tools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 Fifth International Conference on Social Networks Analysis, Management and Security (SNAMS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing authorization models follow a patient centric approach for EHR management where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients' end. This however creates a significant overhead for the patient who has to authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given the multiple personnel involved in providing care and that at times the patient may not be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need of developing a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy cloud-based EHR management. We have developed a novel, centralized, attribute based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based EHR's access authority to the medical providers. In this paper, we describe this novel ABE approach as well as the prototype system that we have created to illustrate it.","2018-07-02","2025-11-10 09:28:46","2025-11-10 09:28:46","","932-935","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 IEEE 11th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","","","","Cloud computing; Ontologies; Encryption; Access control; Medical services; Organizations; Attribute Based Encryption (ABE), Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), Electronic Health Record (EHR), Cloud Storage, Semantic Web, Access Broker, Knowledge Graph (Ontology), Cloud Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE 11th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, we developed SAM - the Semantic-aware Middleware - and the SAM Store. The latter resembles a registry. It allows component providers to publish semantically enriched interfaces and to offer corresponding local and remote implementations. SAM makes use of the SAM Store to match local interprocess communication (IPC) messages transparently against local and remote components. This architecture facilitates the integration of powerful, but resource-intensive remote components, which may be prioritized over local ones, and fosters various patterns of cooperation that demonstrate useful solutions in the area of MCC.

Distributed knowledge brings difficulty to competition and cooperation among services, and hampers the evolution of a service ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a distributed knowledge based evolution model (DKEM) to promote competition and cooperation among services from different venders. DKEM considers stability as key factor in competition, and a stability evaluation model is designed to compute stability of services, venders, and service-based processes according to service invocation histories. Based on the evaluation model, two evolution patterns are given, and they can automatically explore new and more stable cooperation among services by means of runtime self-adaption mechanism. A prototype system for DKEM is implemented and a series of experiments show that DKEM is effective for competition and cooperation among services with distributed knowledge, and, evolved processes have higher stability and response efficiency.","2018-07-02","2025-11-10 09:28:46","2025-11-10 09:28:46","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","","","","Semantics; Knowledge based systems; Ontologies; Ecosystems; Business; distributed knowledge; Runtime; runtime self-adaptation; service ecosystem; service evolution; Stability analysis; stability evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So, there is a need for re-establishing the structures of openly published data on the web by giving various specifications or frameworks of data published in cyberspace. With the aim of better utilization of web data and transition from keyword-based search to contextual search, the Semantic web has emerged as a key milestone. In this direction, Tim Berners Lee has proposed the conventions namely RDF and SPARQL for linking and querying the machine-processable shared data on the web and also a 5-star linked data scheme to distinguish the type of data on web based on its linking properties. This paper presents a Framework for Linking and querying open datasets on government portals, embedding semantics in the data by RDF alignment using state-of-art tools such as OpenRefine and Twinkle tool. The 5-Star scheme has been discussed and practical demonstration of enriching data is given. This clearly puts forward the transition from web of documents to web of data.

While the current workflow management systems implement mostly different complicated graphical tasks based on advanced distributed solutions (e.g., cloud computing and grid computation), workflow knowledge acquisition from texts using case-based reasoning represents more expressive and semantic case representations. We propose in this context, an ontology-based workflow extraction framework to acquire processual knowledge from texts. Our methodology extends the classic NLP techniques to extract and disambiguate complex tasks and relations in texts. Using a graph-based representation of workflows and a domain ontology, our extraction process uses a context-aware approach to recognize workflow components in texts: data and control flows. We applied our framework in a technical domain in bioinformatics: i.e., phylogenetic analyses.

Among the many changes in data processing and service provision paradigms, Software as a Service (SaaS) and collaborative editing are two of the most significant. This paper presents an approach based on semantic publish/subscribe paradigm to the development of collaborative editing applications. The main aim of this research work consists in exploiting emerging technologies (i.e. semantic web data representation formalisms, publish-subscribe platforms) in order to (1) overcome limitations coming from the traditional paradigm of single-author workflows, (2) enhance the editing capabilities of the users, (3) ease the development and maintainment of applications and (4) provide a shared high- level abstraction of the documents that fosters information-level interoperability and reusability. The proposed approach is then validated through an ad-hoc vector graphics application, SCEd (Semantic Collaborative Editor) built upon a SPARQL Event Processing Architecture derived from the Smart-M3 semantic publish-subscribe platform.","2017-11-06","2025-11-10 09:28:46","2025-11-10 09:28:46","","351-357","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 21st Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT)","","","","Semantic Web; Semantics; Knowledge based systems; Ontologies; Publish-subscribe; Collaboration; Graphics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 21st Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To perform complex tasks like monitoring road transport facilities entails huge resources for storing interactive data online. The concept of transport enterprises moving to cloud systems opens up gaps in data management in hybrid and multi-cloud systems. To solve such problems, the implementation of the Data Fabric structure allows you to integrate data and metadata for use on various platforms. The sustainable development of such platforms is facilitated by the use of the Data Fabric mechanism as a built-in system for standardization and coding, the implementation of semantic compatibility, proprietary knowledge graphs and the domain of data values of the transport industry. Data Fabric helps organizations solve complex data problems and use cases by managing their data regardless of application types, platforms, and storage locations, while ensuring seamless data access and sharing in a distributed data environment. The article analyzes the stability of the Data Fabric platform as a domain-oriented decomposition model based on a distributed data architecture with centralized management, but not as a fragmented data warehouse. Using the example of such a decomposition, it is necessary to model an architecture that organizes analytical and other data by areas. In this architecture, the domain's interface with the rest of the organization includes not only operational capabilities, but also access to the analytical data that the domain serves to scale the system.","2023-03-14","2025-11-10 09:28:52","2025-11-10 09:28:52","","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 Systems of Signals Generating and Processing in the Field of on Board Communications","","","","Throughput; Metadata; Computer architecture; Architectural quantum object; Data Fabric (DF); Data Model; Decomposition Model; Distributed Data Protocol; Logical data architecture; Road Transport Systems; Distributed databases; Analytical models; Organizations; Standards organizations; Roads","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 Systems of Signals Generating and Processing in the Field of on Board Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our ultimate goal is to promote information therapy (Ix) as it aims to prescribe the right information to right people at right time. In our solution, Ix is carried out by a SPARQL engine, which is capable for accessing PHRs and other medical data sources within a query.

In this article, we conduct pioneering research on authenticated queries for graph data, which is a popular data type such as the knowledge graph data, on the blockchain-assisted cloud. The primary challenge is how to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) that supports authenticated queries and can be easily maintained by the blockchain. To this end, we propose a novel ADS, named PAGB, based on the RSA accumulator and completeness set. It can also prevent the original data from being revealed to the public through blockchain or irrelevant queries.

Acacia-RDF partitions the RDF data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable SPARQL processor for Acacia-RDF which operates on top of partitioned RDF data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the implementation of scalable graph algorithms such as Triangle counting with such partitioned data sets. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of LUBM RDF benchmark data sets and make a comparison of Acacia's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-RDF scales well with LUBM data sets. Acacia-RDF reported approximately 2 seconds elapsed time on 4 places for running the first and third queries of the LUBM benchmark on LUBM scale 40 data set.

Moreover, due to the lack of standardization, providers differ in the way they define the terms and metrics, making it more difficult to compare different provider SLAs. We have developed a novel framework to significantly automate the process of extracting knowledge embedded in cloud SLAs and representing it in a semantically rich knowledge graph helping the user to make a calculated decision in choosing a provider. Our framework captures the key terms, measures, and deontic rules, in the form of obligations and permissions present in the cloud SLAs.

Analysis of monitoring data delivers insights of the system's workload and usage pattern and ensures workloads are operating at optimum levels. The analysis process involves data query and extraction, data analysis, and result visualization. Since the volume of monitoring data is big, these operations require a scalable and reliable architecture to extract, aggregate, and analyze data in an arbitrary range of granularity. Ultimately, the results of analysis become the knowledge of the system and should be shared and communicated. This paper presents our cloud service architecture that explores a search cluster for data indexing and query. We develop REST APIs that the data can be accessed by different analysis modules. This architecture enables extensions to integrate with software frameworks of both batch processing (such as Hadoop) and stream processing (such as Spark) of big data. The analysis results are structured in Semantic Media Wiki pages in the context of the monitoring data source and the analysis process.

Moreover, most of them support only exact keyword search, which greatly affects data usability and user experience. So how to design a searchable encryption scheme that supports personalized search and improves user search experience remains a very challenging task. In this paper, for the first time, we study and solve the problem of personalized multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data (PRSE) while preserving privacy in cloud computing. With the help of semantic ontology WordNet, we build a user interest model for individual user by analyzing the user's search history, and adopt a scoring mechanism to express user interest smartly. To address the limitations of the model of “one size fit all” and keyword exact search, we propose two PRSE schemes for different search intentions. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate our analysis and show that our proposed solution is very efficient and effective.","2016-09-01","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","2546-2559","","9","27","","IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Cloud security; Encryption; Indexes; Servers; outsourcing security; personalized search; user interest model; Computational modeling; Search problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed eHeaRSS is like a family doctor to care patients, especially to use generated patients-context. eHeaRSS is a recommendation system for immediate and appropriate medical services using crowd sourcing in cloud computing environment. To do this, it is necessary to classify the data into symptoms, diseases, departments and doctors related data types. To consider hierarchies or subsume relationships among them, eHeaRSS Ontology (eHeaRSS-Ont) is developed through integration of 4-static ontology (4-Ont) which is comprised of symptom-, disease-, department-and doctor-Ont to create tailored recommendations depending on patient-context. For the recommendation service, Case-based reasoning (CBR) is applied. The extracted cases using 4-Ont are integrated by eHeaRSS-Ont depending on the patient-context. For customization, it is necessary to reconfigure the case using eHeaRSS Constraints Value Compatibility Map (eHeaRSS-CVCM). To prove the significance and efficiency of the eHeaRSS, we experimented using ontology-based data processing and proved the superiority of eHeaRSS with the provision of better recommendation than other DB-based systems.","2015-12-19","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","1108-1113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart City/SocialCom/SustainCom (SmartCity)","","","","Ontology; Knowledge based systems; Ontologies; Healthcare; Health; Context; Cloud computing environment; Diseases; Hospitals; Case-based Reasoning; Crowd sourcing; Recommendation Service System","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart City/SocialCom/SustainCom (SmartCity)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the support of them, we first mine all the potential hierarchy and semantics from a user query and acquire sensitive terms relative to privacy policies automatically without training documents.","2015-12-19","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","1139-1142","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart City/SocialCom/SustainCom (SmartCity)","","","","Semantics; Ontology; Ontologies; Data privacy; Privacy; Access control; Diseases; LSA; Privacy and access control for cloud computing; Training; medical information retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart City/SocialCom/SustainCom (SmartCity)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cloud user becomes willing to accept insecure conditions and unconsciously increases these conditions' security level if he is able to find a strategy that provides trust. This level of trust, once established, is difficult to maintain if any deception takes place. The indications of proven trust can only be seen in future usage of a cloud service. For this reason, specific control instruments are required to ascertain the accuracy of one's trust. The establishment of trust in a public cloud environment requires a paradigm change: a holistic strategy that enforces regulation requirements throughout the cloud architecture. The movement of the root of trust into hardware reduces vulnerability to compromise, as hardware attacks require a high expenditure of time and effort. Cloud users would define regulation standards through trust-worthy IT instruments and enforce them in specific cloud-service layers. The extension of this approach is the regulation of SaaS-based applications to enforce requirements for separation and availability. This work introduces a conceptual approach to establish a chain of policy by using hardware-oriented root of trust. The conceptual description of a chain of policy outlines the main principles to enforce regulations accurately for each architectural cloud layer based on an established chain of trust.","2015-12-07","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","601-606","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)","","","","Cloud computing; Ontology; Security; Ontologies; Computer architecture; Hardware; Compliance; Regulation; Trusted Cloud; Virtual machine monitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can be recommended to end-users in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) under Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) of WS-Policy. Generally, the matrix of collected QoS parameter values is sparse and the accurate prediction of the missing QoS values is important for the recommendation of appropriate web services to the end users. To address this issue, we worked out an artificial neural network model for the prediction of missing QoS-values using past QoS performance parameter data.

Access Control is one of the traditional and essential security tools of data protection. The decision to grant access to a resource must ensure secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In particular, the challenge is more important with public clouds as many governing authorities could be involved in one cloud scenario. This implies a difficulty to work out which regulation should be applicable in case of conflict. In recent years, many access control models were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their security policies specification and enforcement. In this paper, we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies for the context of public cloud. Throughout the use of ontology tools, we propose an approach for checking privacy enforcement with access control conditions. We also suggest the use of privacy safeguards notification where the threat to privacy protection is related to the secondary usage of personal data more than just the data access itself.","2015-06-02","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 International Conference on Cloud Technologies and Applications (CloudTech)","","","","Cloud computing; semantic web; ontology; access control; data management; privacy; Data protection; Privacy; Access control; law enforcement; public Cloud; security policies; Organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 International Conference on Cloud Technologies and Applications (CloudTech)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence there is a need to develop an EHR system that addresses these bottlenecks for safe, secure, and easy cloud-based EHR management. To address these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that allows policy-based multi-authority access permission to Electronic Health Record systems used by multiple care providers from various places or organizations.

In cloud computing, the unique characteristics in cloud services such as dynamic and diverse services offered at different levels, together with the lack of standardized description languages pose significant challenges for effective cloud service discovery. In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service categories to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching in real environments. Our approach has the capability to automatically identify and categorize cloud services by detecting cloud service concepts from cloud service sources. Initially, we focus on building the cloud service ontology by using NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology). Then, we utilize our cloud service categorization method to investigate cloud service ontology's concepts in a real-world cloud services dataset which contains the metadata of 5,883 real cloud services. After that, we generate cloud service clusters by using cosine similarity to build the cloud service categorization. Our cloud service categorization is helpful in determining whether a given web source is a cloud service. Furthermore, the new web resource which has been categorized as a cloud service can be used to boost knowledge of cloud service categorization cumulatively. The proposed approach is validated by using real-world cloud services available on the World Wide Web and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in cloud service discovery.","2015-09-21","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","151-158","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE 19th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference","","","","ontology; Ontologies; taxonomy; Cloud service; Search engines; Platform as a service; NIST; web service; Software as a service; service discovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 19th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasing availability of genomic data, traditional bioinformatic tools require substantial computational time and the creation of ever-larger indices each time a researcher seeks to gain insight from the data. To address these challenges, we pre-computed important relationships between biological entities spanning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and captured this information in a relational database. The database can be queried across hundreds of millions of entities and returns results in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. In this paper, we describe Functional Genomics Platform (formerly known as OMXWare), a comprehensive database relating genotype to phenotype for bacterial life. Continually updated, the Functional Genomics Platform today contains data derived from 200,000 curated, self-consistently assembled genomes. The database stores functional data for over 68 million genes, 52 million proteins, and 239 million domains with associated biological activity annotations from Gene Ontology, KEGG, MetaCyc, and Reactome.

Providers of Cloud Computing services for Data Mining publish the descriptions and definitions in many formats and often not compatible with other providers. From a functional point of view, having the possibility to describe complete Data Mining services is fundamental to maintain the usability and especially the portability of these services independently of the software/hardware support or even the differences between cloud platforms. The main objective of this article is to design a Data Mining service definition which allows to compose with a single and simple definition a complete service, in such way a data mining workflow can be ported and deployed in different providers or even in a Market Place of this type of ready-to-consume services. This article presents a semantic scheme for the definition and description of complete Data Mining services considering both the management of the service by the provider (price, authentication, Service Level Agreement, ...) and the definition of the Data Mining workflow as a service. It represents a solid contribution for paving the way to the standardization and industrialization of Data Mining services. To asses the validity of the scheme a list of services from Data Mining providers have been described and an example of a full service for a Random Forest algorithm has been defined as a service. In addition, a practical scenario has been developed, creating a deployment platform for Data Mining services to give functional support to the scheme, illustrating the practical benefits of the proposal for the end user.","2022-04-01","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","945-955","","2","15","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; data mining; Data mining; Machine learning; cloud service brokerage; linked data; service definition; service description; Unified modeling language; Proposals; Vocabulary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on analysis, conversion, extraction and refinement for the big data, a disease can be prevented and group behavior can be predicted. However, each user's private data is also an element in big data. Users must provide private data to the service providers to meet their functional requirements. To gain economic benefits, some SaaS service providers have not been authorized to collect and analyze the user's sensitive private data, as a result, the user's private data is disclosed. In this paper, we propose a private data chain disclosure discovery method, to prevent a user's sensitive privacy information from being illegally disclosed. First, we measure the similarity degree and cost of the disclosure of the private data. Second, according to the similarity degree and cost of disclosure, the disclosure chain and key private data are detected in the process of interaction between user and SaaS service. Third, we propose a discovery framework for the private data chain and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness by experiments.","2022-02-01","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","59-68","","1","15","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontology; Ontologies; Data privacy; Big Data; Privacy; privacy data chain; privacy disclosure detection; similarity metric; Software as a service; Computer science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This new big data-centric service model aims to provide customer-oriented massive services by combining both physical and virtualized resources from different domains. Although such complex ecosystem is able to process, encapsulate and offer huge volumes of data as services, its management operations are beyond the ability of human administrators, due to several challenges including the big services’ large-scale nature and complexity, the heterogeneity of their components (e.g., services, data sources, connected things), the dynamicity and uncertainty of their hosting cloud environments. To cope with the lack of understanding regarding big services capabilities, we propose to describe them using a novel meta-model for the quality of big services (QoBS). We also take advantage of a recent technology called knowledge graphs, to represent the big service information (service descriptions, services’ and data sources’ quality levels, management policies) as a heterogeneous information network. Finally, a multi-view representation learning approach is proposed to infer additional knowledge regarding big services capabilities.","2021-12-30","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE/ACS 18th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","","","","Cloud computing; Knowledge graph; Uncertainty; Neural networks; Big data-centric service; Big service representation; Graph Neural Network; Multi-view learning; Quality of big service; Knowledge engineering; Computational modeling; Soft sensors; Representation learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE/ACS 18th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many cloud computing providers offer their cloud resources according to their own rules. The descriptions of various cloud resources also differ for each vendor. Subsequently, it becomes difficult to find suitable cloud resources given the characteristics of an application. Scientists therefore, select resources used in previous experiments or best performance resources without considering the characteristics of their applications. There is the need to standardize notations to support simple selection of cloud resources without the constraints of providers. Intercloud can use cloud resources without considering cloud providers in hybrid cloud environments. Intercloud project has been studied for interoperability and creates mOSAIC ontology to conceptualize various resources. However, the mOSAIC ontology attributes are limited when considering characteristics of an application. We propose a semantic engine to provide semantic cloud resource services in intercloud environment. We define a rule of categorized resource description with reference to mOSAIC ontology attributes which includes added factors needed to represent application characteristics. We also develop a semantic engine which can choose semantically similar cloud resources using statistical analysis while considering the characteristics of an application.

Since the attributes of the Users will change with time, the encryption policies adopted may also vary. For large EHR systems, it is often necessary to search through the encrypted data in realtime and perform client-side computations without decrypting all patient records. This paper describes our novel cloud-based EHR system that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) combined with Semantic Web technologies to facilitate differential access to an EHR, thereby ensuring only Users with valid attributes can access a particular field of the EHR. The system also includes searchable encryption using keyword index and search trapdoor, which allows querying EHR fields without decrypting the entire patient record. The attribute revocation feature is efficiently managed in our EHR by delegating the revision of the secret key and ciphertext to the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). Our methodology incorporates advanced security features that eliminate malicious use of EHR data and contributes significantly towards ensuring secure digital health systems on the Cloud.","2021-09-05","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","38-47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Digital Health (ICDH)","","","","Cloud Computing; Semantic Web; Semantics; Attribute Revocation; Cloud Security; Privacy; Encryption; Access control; Knowledge Graph (Ontology); Electronic Health Record; Searchable Encryption; Organizations; Electronic healthcare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE International Conference on Digital Health (ICDH)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper evaluated these strategies and concluded that despite the advances they introduced, none of them actually solves the cloud lock-in problem. To address this issue, this paper proposes the use of Semantic Web concepts to avoid cloud lock-in. The strategy consists of using RDF models to specify the features of a cloud service, which are managed by SPARQL queries. The contribution of this paper is fourfold: (i) to evaluate three multi-cloud solutions for the cloud lock-in problem in the context of three cloud platforms, (ii) to propose a strategy using RDF and SPARQL for managing cloud resources, (iii) to present the Cloud Query Manager (CQM), an SPARQL server that implements the proposal, and (vi) to compare three multi-cloud solutions with CQM in terms of response time and the effectiveness in the resolution of the cloud lock-in problem.","2015-07-27","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","702-709","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; cloud computing; semantic web; RDF; SPARQL; Resource description framework; Servers; Data models; Computational modeling; Virtual machining; cloud lock-in","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology.","2015-07-27","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","1081-1084","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","","","","Cloud computing; cloud security; Security; Ontologies; NIST; Cloud security models; Security compliance models; ISO Standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, today's BPaaS solutions lack an explicit and formal semantics which prevent an easy and dynamic interoperability between different cloud providers. In this paper, we propose firstly to semantically populate a shared knowledge base of process models deployed by BPaaS providers. Therefore, using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve similar process fragments that can be used to design new process variants.

KG is a key step for artificial intelligence to move towards intelligence. Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is a key technology in the construction of KG. The aim is to complement the missing knowledge in the KG. With the development of the Internet, the scale of data increases exponentially, and the scale of KG is increasing day by day. It is very inefficient to make up the missing knowledge based on manual, so many algorithms of KGC have emerged. In this paper, some typical KGC algorithms based on representation learning are summarized and combed, which are mainly divided into tensor decomposition, neural network and translation transformation. The development direction and prospect of KGC in KG are discussed and prospected.","2021-04-24","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","222-228","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA)","","","","Cloud computing; Knowledge based systems; Neural networks; KG; KGC; presentation learning; Knowledge engineering; Conferences; Manuals; Tensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the years Cloud systems became more and more complex. The main idea is that all Cloud components offer their functions as a service. For this reason Cloud systems inherits many features from old Web Services and Service Oriented architectures. At the moment, the need for composition and automation of Cloud services is a hot research field. Orchestration is one of the topics that researchers are investigating. Unlike web services, it is not clear what orchestration means in Cloud Systems. It usually addresses automation, but no clear definitions and languages have been provided. Another hot topic regarding composition of cloud services is the definition of design, architectural and communication Patterns for solving well known and common problems. In this work we will show how Orchestration and some Patterns are tightly coupled. We will describe a methodology for definition of orchestrated workflows which exploits some common Cloud Design Patterns in order to verify composition soundness. In addition we will show how this methodology can be used to verify some requirements on the composed Cloud services. The whole methodology is based both on formal semantics definition of an Orchestration language, and on the use of Ontologies for the description of Cloud services interactions.","2015-07-08","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","192-199","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 Ninth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontologies; Quality of service; Computer architecture; Formal Semantics; Availability; Orchestration; Service-oriented architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 Ninth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing authorization models follow a patient-centric approach for EHR management, where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients end. This creates a significant overhead for the patient who must authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given that multiple personnel are typically involved in providing care and that the patient may not always be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need to develop a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy to use cloud-based EHR Service management. We present a novel, centralized, attribute-based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based EHRs access authority to medical providers.","2021-12-01","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","1612-1623","","6","14","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; cloud computing; Encryption; Authorization; access broker; attribute based access control (ABAC); Attribute based encryption (ABE); cloud storage; electronic health record (EHR); knowledge graph (ontology); Electronic medical records; Medical services; Organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In some circumstances, the keywords that the user searches on are only semantically related to the data rather than via an exact or fuzzy match. Hence, semantic-based keyword search over encrypted cloud data becomes of paramount importance. However, existing schemes usually depend upon a global dictionary, which not only affects the accuracy of search results but also causes inefficiency in data updating. Additionally, although compound keyword search is common in practice, the existing approaches only process them as single words, which split the original semantics and achieve low accuracy. To address these limitations, we initially propose a compound concept semantic similarity (CCSS) calculation method to measure the semantic similarity between compound concepts. Next, by integrating CCSS with Locality-Sensitive Hashing function and the secure kk<; inline-graphic xlink:href=""wang-ieq1-2847318.gif""/>-Nearest Neighbor scheme, a semantic-based compound keyword search (SCKS) scheme is proposed. SCKS achieves not only semantic-based search but also multi-keyword search and ranked keyword search. Additionally, SCKS also eliminates the predefined global library and can efficiently support data update. The experimental results on real-world dataset indicate that SCKS introduces low overhead on computation and the search accuracy outperforms the existing schemes.","2021-06-01","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","850-863","","3","14","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Searchable encryption; Keyword search; semantic similarity; Encryption; compound concept; Compounds; Indexes; semantic-based keyword search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So, vendor lock-in problem appeared. One solution to this problem is to use generic APIs with specific adapters. However, any update in a PaaS specific-API makes its corresponding adapter is unusable which causes, what we call, API synchronization problem. Therefore, STAGER (SemanTic-based GenERation of Generic-API Adapters) framework is proposed. STAGER framework provides a semi-automatic adapter generation process, which generates specific adapters of generic APIs for PaaS services (e.g., blob storage and datastore services) for target PaaS platforms. The adapter generation process is based on semantic annotations of the generic APIs and their corresponding PaaS specific-APIs. In order to evaluate STAGER framework, two generic APIs for blob storage and NoSQL datastore services have been proposed. STAGER framework is used to generate the adapters of these generic APIs for two PaaS platforms: Google App Engine (GAE) and Windows Azure. Although there is some overhead for semantically annotating the PaaS APIs, the evaluation results prove the feasibility of STAGER framework and promote the usage of the generated adapters for implementing portable cloud applications.","2021-06-01","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","903-914","","3","14","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontologies; Computer architecture; semantic annotation; Adaptation models; generic API; Java; PaaS heterogeneity; vendor lock-in; Computational modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the field of advanced manufacturing however, the impact has been significantly lesser than expected due to limitations in cloud platforms for fostering community engagement. To address this problem, we study a new cloud-based architecture that provides Platform-asa-Service (PaaS) management capabilities to the manufacturing community for delivering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) “Apps” to their customers. Our architecture aims at supporting an “App Marketplace” that thrives on agile development, organic collaboration and scalable sales of next generation manufacturing Apps requiring high-performance simulation and modeling. Towards realizing the vision of the above architecture, our paper involves investigation and implementation of an Ontology Service that interoperates with other common web services related to resource brokering and accounting. Our Ontology Service uses principles of mapping and merging to translate a manufacturing App's collaboration requirements to suitable resource specifications on public cloud platforms. Integrated resultant ontology can be queried to provision the required resource parameters such as amount of memory/storage, number of processing units, and network protocol configurations needed for deployment of an App. We validate the effectiveness of our Ontology Service using the Protégé framework in a pilot testbed of a real-world “WheelSim” App in the NSF GENI Cloud platform.

As the volume of cloud-based EHRs reaches Big Data levels, it is essential to search over these encrypted patient records without decrypting them to ensure that the medical caregivers can efficiently access the EHRs. This is especially critical if the caregivers have access to only certain sections of the patient EHR and should not decrypt the whole record.

However, relinquishing control of sensitive medical data by delegating their storage and processing to third-party cloud providers naturally raises significant security concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise appropriate policies that infuse adequate access controls in cloud services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of these services, coupled with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinder the formulation of effective and interoperable policies that are appropriate for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work adopts the ontological templates proposed in [5] for the representation of access control policies in the medical sector. By capturing the knowledge that must be infused into an access control policy, these templates sufficiently address the needs of the underlying domain of application in which such a policy is to be enforced; at the same time, they facilitate developers in infusing adequate access controls to their cloud applications.","2017-06-22","2025-11-10 09:29:04","2025-11-10 09:29:04","","805-810","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontologies; Access control; Electronic medical records; Context-aware access control; Security-by-design; Medical services; Context modeling; Process control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily. The application of Asclepios is wide ranging - from military to Government through to medical and tourism and pharmaceuticals. Further, Asclepios-like applications are very much needed in most Third world countries, including all countries in Africa, as it can significantly enhance the health, safety and well-being of people.","2017-06-30","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:29:05","","1-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 IST-Africa Week Conference (IST-Africa)","","","","Cloud computing; Ontologies; Metadata; Data mining; Computer architecture; Agile information exploitation; Communicable diseases; Metadata generation; Ontology management; Pattern recognition algorithms; Shallow text processing; Tools; Infectious diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IST-Africa Week Conference (IST-Africa)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Proving an SLA violation is considered to be a complex operation to the cloud consumer. This task gets more and more difficult to the consumers as they use services from multiple providers, each with its own monitoring policies. In order to implicitly help the consumer monitor the SLA and detect violations, it is necessary to implement some advanced SLA management strategies. Ontological representation and reasoning techniques in SLA management may be beneficial to the evaluation of the QoS. In this regard, we propose a monitoring approach with a new semantic SLA modeling for cloud computing. Our approach aims to help cloud consumers monitor the SLA documents and detect violations by considering the semantic meaning of SLA concepts and taking profit from the power of reasoning techniques. This maintains a reliable QoS and respects the SLA parameters. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in this paper through a simulation and a case study.","2017-06-25","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:29:05","","338-345","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Ontology; Monitoring; Ontologies; Quality of service; Service Level Agreements; SLA Monitoring; Measurement; Tools; Computational modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methodology is enhanced by semantic algorithms and mappings to reduce hidden query and data biases.

One of the possible solutions is the use of data anonymization techniques, which performs an important role in data privacy protection. There are several techniques and algorithms to implement data anonymization. However, specifications and guidelines to guide and standardize the use of these resources are needed. These guidelines, called anonymization policies, are considered an important asset in organizations that want to protect their customer personal data. Although the use of data anonymization brings great benefits, there are no clear directions for data anonymization policies, which ends up limiting its adoption by companies and organizations. This work presents a generic anonymization policy to be used in cloud and big data platforms. It also presents a draft ontology with explicit formal specifications for data anonymization policies. This ontology has three main intentions: (i) to standardize the use of data anonymization policies; (ii) share common understanding of the structure of data anonymization among people; (iii) enable reuse of data anonymization policies.

To ensure data confidentiality and fine-grained access control in cloud-based environments, stored data and resources needs to be re-encrypted periodically or based on special mechanisms such as revoked user-based or manual re-encryption. Managing the process of re-encryption is a challenging issue that involves many limitations such as time management, resource confidentiality, and level of access. Accordingly, a multi-level re-encryption model based on policy management has been presented in this paper to ensure data security in clouds. The proposed model uses a policy-based ontology to generate, manage and apply re-encryption policies based on the characteristics of resources, sensitivity of data and capabilities of service provider. The results of comprehensive performance and security analysis of proposed model shows this model increases the reliability of re-encryption processes in cloud storages considerably and provides an efficient policy management for re-encryption tasks.","2017-07-06","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:29:05","","15-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE EUROCON 2017 -17th International Conference on Smart Technologies","","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Security; Ontologies; Reliability; Cryptography; Encryption; Policy; Re-Encryption; Resource Management; Data models; Computational modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE EUROCON 2017 -17th International Conference on Smart Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These documents are generated following a process of negotiation during which the client chooses a subset of clauses among choices predefined by the provider on a ""take it or leave it"" basis. However, the heterogeneity between client requests and provider offers may result in inappropriate SLA. In addition, the cloud service context may change over the time which causes a client requirements adjustment and therefore, the SLA remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cloud SLA negotiation and re-negotiation approach that integrate a semantic mapping between client requests and provider offers with the aim of generating a suitable SLA document.

The paper presents a solution to prevent high risk situations, using ontology as support in profiling pregnant women with possible pregnancy risks. Based on ontology and available medical database of one of the largest maternity hospitals in Timisoara (Bega) we create profiles of women focusing on cases with problems and high potential risks, using as tool the open source Protégé for ontology and Visual Studio .Net for the supporting application. The ontology creates links between the characteristics of pregnant women, medical history, disease and possible problems that may occur during pregnancy. The ontology is used in an application stored in cloud to be accessed by physicians from different locations.

However, currently, the CABAN paradigm in the healthcare domain is facing increasing difficulty in handling the huge amount of sensor data that the body sensor devices generate from diverse Smart home applications. Therefore, the challenging is now timely storing, processing, and analyzing of the sensor data in real time to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the caregivers or Smart home applications. QoS, here, is the capacity to support diverse Smart home applications in healthcare with different priorities, performance, and resource requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast and robust cloud resource allocation model for body sensor devices to ensure QoS for Smart home healthcare applications. We develop the proposed resource allocation algorithm using agent-based modeling (ABM) and ontology. There are few works, which consider ABM and ontology for resource allocation in CABAN platform. Moreover, we used an ABM tool called NetLogo to implement the proposed resource allocation model.

While one cloud provider is good at one or a few services, other providers might be good at other services. Cloud users eventually want to consume most advantageous resources across multiple providers with the best price while avoiding vendor lock-in. Cloud users also need to safeguard their most valuable digital asset, their data, against cloud outage, which can happen to any vendor. This could mean using the same type of resources across multiple cloud providers. Moreover, cloud providers are continuously changing and evolving their services. Cloud users can only take advantage of these changes if they are able to relocate and real-locate resources using an autonomous and vendor independent tool. We propose a vendor-independent cloud provisioning tool that utilizes an ontology-based semantic reasoning to acquire the best feasible cloud resources for cloud users. In this paper, we outline an ontology subset for purchasing cloud resources or services based on price, user transaction volume, preference, quality of service and Service Layer Agreements (SLA). The proposed ontology is outlined in a case scenario followed by an applied algorithm for negotiating resource purchase between cloud consumer client and cloud vendor provisioning services.

In this highly dynamic scenario, both providers and consumers need to formalize their contractual and legal relationship, creating service level agreements. Although there exist some proposals that provide models to describe that relationship, they usually only cover technical aspects, not providing explicit semantics to the agreement terms. Furthermore, these models cannot be effectively shared on the Web, since they do not actually follow Web principles. These drawbacks hamper take-up and automatic analysis. In this article, we introduce Linked USDL Agreement, a semantic model to specify, manage and share service level agreement descriptions on the Web. This model is part of the Linked USDL family of ontologies that can describe not only technical but also business related aspects of services, incorporating Web principles. We validate our proposal by describing agreements in computational and non-computational scenarios, namely cloud computing and business process outsourcing services. Moreover, we evaluate the actual coverage and expressiveness of Linked USDL Agreement comparing it with existing models.

This leads users to a loos of control over their data and raises reasonable security concerns that slow down the adoption of Cloud computing. Is the Cloud service provider accessing the data? Is it legitimately applying the access control policy defined by the user? This paper presents a data-centric access control solution with enriched role-based expressiveness in which security is focused on protecting user data regardless the Cloud service provider that holds it. Novel identity-based and proxy re-encryption techniques are used to protect the authorization model. Data is encrypted and authorization rules are cryptographically protected to preserve user data against the service provider access or misbehavior. The authorization model provides high expressiveness with role hierarchy and resource hierarchy support. The solution takes advantage of the logic formalism provided by Semantic Web technologies, which enables advanced rule management like semantic conflict detection.

A key challenge related to composition of such multi-organizational business processes and workflows is posed by the security and access control policies of the underlying organizational domains. In this paper, we propose a framework for verifying secure composability of distributed workflows in an autonomous multi-domain environment. The objective of workflow composability verification is to ensure that all the users or processes executing the designated workflow tasks conform to the time-dependent security policy specifications of all collaborating domains. A key aspect of such verification is to determine the time-dependent schedulability of distributed workflows, assumed to be invoked on a recurrent basis. We use a two-step approach for verifying secure workflow composability. In the first step, a distributed workflow is decomposed into domain-specific projected workflows and is verified for conformance with the respective domain's security and access control policy. In the second step, the cross-domain dependencies amongst the workflow tasks performed by different collaborating domains are verified.","2017-10-01","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:29:05","","478-493","","5","14","","IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Security and privacy protection; verification; Indexes; Authorization; access controls; workflow management; Computers; Business; Unified modeling language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the proliferation of cloud services transforms the enterprise IT environment into a complex ecosystem of collaborating services. One way to tame this complexity and alleviate the security concerns is to rely on policies that regulate the deployment, delivery and governance of cloud services.

Nowadays, such solutions consist mostly on ICT developments, which permit the collection, distribution, integration, analysis, and manipulation of heterogeneous data. The under way Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project targets the development of cloud-enabled tools for supporting the SMEs supply network optimization of manufacturing and logistic assets. The C2NET solution includes the implementation of paradigms as e.g. cloud computing or service-oriented and event-driven architectures, used for wide data integration. Among its requirements, the C2NET platform needs a solution for catch, process and react to events triggered in different locations of collaborative manufacturing networks, which are endowed with devices that permits the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This paper presents the architecture and main functionality of a knowledge-based approach that allows processing supply chain events handled by CPS devices. The main component of the presented solution is the SECA ontology, which is a knowledge base that can be updated at runtime. The main purpose of the ontology is to describe events, their status and the actions to be performed once a set of events are triggered in certain order.

Here, a database partitioning approach to logically and physically separate data and distribute the partitions across several different cloud providers is applied. This data distribution is called fixed vertical partitioning and distribution approach (FVPD), as data schemes are vertically partitioned and distributed across various different cloud providers. Hence, this framework uses a security-by-distribution approach to storing sensitive data securely and privacy-ware in all possible cloud deployment models and thus, it provides a solution to improve the level of security and privacy. The proposed FVPD approach also becomes viable in the context of LOD and the Semantic Web. Furthermore, in relevant literature no approach in this context has been dealing with security and privacy so far. Therefore, this work transfers the FVPD approach from relational databases to Semantic Web Frameworks (Apache Jena, Sesame, etc.) that provide storage engines for RDF data and corresponding SPARQL endpoints. Above that, the query performance of such a federated environment is compared to a non-partitioned and non-distributed environment. For this, an adapted version of the TPC-W benchmark is used. Thus, this work shows how the query performance is affected when relational database data are exposed as SPARQL endpoints in RDF-based form and how the FVPD approach influences the query performance. Finally, it illustrates a mechanism to improve the level of security and privacy through a security-by-distribution approach.","2016-10-13","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","241-247","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","","","","cloud computing; semantic web; Security; Data privacy; Context; Resource description framework; security; RDF-based data; Distributed databases; Relational databases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud-based security ontologies are organized frameworks that delineate and classify topics pertinent to security in CC settings. They assist in standardizing language and enhance communication, interoperability, and comprehension among diverse stakeholders, including security experts, developers, and organizations. The ontology-based security strategy is one of the security solutions used by relevant parties. Nevertheless, target customers and cloud service providers see it as complex and lacking in security, since the applicable paradigms for various contexts are not clearly defined. Previous research has identified many security ideas that service providers might use, employing several evaluation methodologies. This highlights the growing need for reviewing the literature on Cloud Security Ontology (CSO). This research outlines the current state of the art in cloud computing ontology (CCO) and conducts a comprehensive literature review on the topic. Using the systematic literature review (SLR) approach, we identified 100 papers; 60 were selected based on established criteria, and 25 were assessed to be pertinent to the study. Scholars have shown active interest in four main areas of CC—service description, cloud security (CS), cloud resource management, cloud interoperability, and cloud service discovery—where cloud ontologies have had a significant impact. According to the research, fifteen of the thirty-one methods described in the literature for using ontologies in the cloud domain are still in use in legacy computing settings. The findings reveal several issues with improving company operations in cloud and multi-cloud settings via the use of ontologies.

However, the sparsity of service data and the presence of noise in interactions make it extremely challenging to accurately capture user preferences. Existing service recommendation methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily rely on ID aggregation, often neglecting the richness of textual semantics and are susceptible to interaction noise, resulting in suboptimal modeling of user-service relationships. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable advantages in capturing textual semantics, current methods struggle to effectively align structural representations with textual representations, limiting improvements in recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-semantic graph diffusion model for service recommendation, DiffMSR, which aims to align textual and structural representations while learning the generation process of interaction graphs in a denoising manner. This approach mitigates data sparsity and effectively reduces noise interference. Specifically, the model leverages LLMs to capture the textual semantic features of service descriptions and integrates them with structured semantic information from knowledge graphs. Through cross-semantic contrastive learning, it achieves heterogeneous semantic alignment. Furthermore, the model introduces a multisemantic diffusion-based generation framework, which iteratively denoises to construct high-quality user-service interaction graphs. This significantly enhances the multi-semantic awareness of user representations, thereby improving recommendation performance. Experiments on public service datasets demonstrate that DiffMSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving improvements of 4.13% and 6.37% in recommendation accuracy and recall, respectively.","2025-10","2025-11-10 09:29:12","2025-11-10 09:29:12","","2740-2753","","5","18","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge graphs; Semantics; Recommender systems; service recommendation; LLM; knowledge graph; Feature extraction; Data models; Accuracy; Noise reduction; Large language models; Contrastive learning; Noise; graph diffusion; semantic alignment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite advancements in scheduling algorithms, existing methods face critical challenges, including suboptimal energy efficiency, limited adaptability to dynamic cloud environments, and insufficient context-aware decision-making. Recent techniques, such as Meta Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and Energy-Aware Scheduling, show potential but often struggle with high computational complexity, static resource allocation, or scalability issues. These shortcomings result in inefficient resource utilization, elevated energy usage, and difficulties in meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Energy Efficient Semantic Scheduling Framework (ESSF), a novel approach combining semantic reasoning and energy profiling to optimize task scheduling in dynamic cloud environments. The framework integrates three key components: (1) Dynamic Energy Profiling (DEP) for real-time energy monitoring, (2) Semantic Resource Matching (SRM) utilizing knowledge graphs for context-aware allocation, and (3) Adaptive Workload Balancing (AWB) to dynamically redistribute tasks for improved resource utilization and energy efficiency. Experiments using the Google Cluster Trace Dataset demonstrate that ESSF reduces energy consumption by up to 25% compared to traditional methods while achieving 90% resource utilization and 97% SLA compliance. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to overcome existing limitations, offering a scalable, adaptive, and environmentally sustainable solution for task scheduling in cloud computing.","2025-02-18","2025-11-10 09:29:12","2025-11-10 09:29:12","","274-281","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2025 4th International Conference on Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning (ICSADL)","","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Knowledge graphs; Semantics; Dynamic Energy Profiling; Energy Efficiency; Google Cluster Trace Dataset; Knowledge Graphs; Semantic Scheduling; Resource management; Dynamic scheduling; Service level agreements; Energy efficiency; Real-time systems; Energy consumption; Processor scheduling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025 4th International Conference on Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning (ICSADL)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Kang","Service Recommendation Based on Multi-Level View Contrastive Learning","IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","","1932-4537","10.1109/TNSM.2024.3510399","","In the context of the rapid development of service-oriented computing and cloud computing, selecting the service that meets the user’s needs from an ever-increasing number of Web services is always challenging. Exploiting auxiliary information such as a Knowledge Graph (KG) can significantly improve the effectiveness of service recommendations. However, current KG-based service recommendation methods usually merely integrate the knowledge semantic information into the user-service interaction model, which ignores the importance of global structure and does not fully consider the in-depth learning of individual user preferences. To this end, this paper proposes a Multi-Level View Contrastive Learning for Service Recommendation (MCSR) approach to address the above challenges. In particular, unlike traditional approaches that consider only two views, we consider three views, i.e., the global structure view, the local collaboration view, and the semantic view. Specifically, the user-service graph is regarded as the collaboration view, the service-entity graph as the semantic view, and the user-service-entity graph as the structural view. By applying contrastive learning across these views at different levels, MCSR fully leverages graph features and structural information, integrating auxiliary relational semantics into user-service interaction modeling. Furthermore, recognizing that the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly improving recommendation accuracy., since the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy. The experimental results show that MCSR significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, with the positive impact of its key components on the recommended performance verified by ablation experiments.","2025-04","2025-11-10 09:29:12","2025-11-10 09:29:12","","1690-1702","","2","22","","IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge graphs; Semantics; Knowledge transfer; contrastive learning; meta-networks; Multi-level view; service recommendation; Quality of service; Collaborative filtering; Mashups; Social networking (online); Collaboration; Predictive models; Accuracy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study conceptualizes SaaS selection as a multi-criteria combinatorial problem within predefined constraints. To address this, we introduce a hybrid approach incorporating an entire optimization algorithm. Our method leverages semantic and microservice (individual) SaaS descriptions in the Ontology Web Language for Services (OWL-S). Each micro SaaS is linked to compatible SaaS instances (offering similar functionality) in a unified environment, guided by the compatibility concept. A micro-SaaS may not satisfy a particular functional need in specific contexts. However, it is possible to meet customer requirements by combining the available SaaS instances, called virtual SaaS. The chosen SaaS should be the best based on the defined quality and quantitative criteria. Our proposed approach, employing multi-criteria analysis, capitalizes on a dedicated Quality of Service (QoS) ontology tailored for the cloud environment and web applications.

Therefore, protecting knowledge graph data stored on third-party cloud platforms is essential.

Gaps in monitoring can lead to delay in incident detection and significant negative customer impact. Current process of monitor creation is ad-hoc and reactive in nature. Developers create monitors using their tribal knowledge and, primarily, a trial and error based process. As a result, monitors often have incomplete coverage which leads to production issues, or, redundancy which results in noise and wasted effort. In this work, we address this issue by proposing an intelli-gent monitoring framework that recommends monitors for cloud services based on their service properties. We start by mining the attributes of 30,000+ monitors from 791 production services at Microsoft and derive a structured ontology for monitors. We focus on two crucial dimensions: what to monitor (resources) and which metrics to monitor. We conduct an extensive empirical study and derive key insights on the major classes of monitors employed by cloud services at Microsoft, their associated dimensions, and the interrelationship between service properties and this ontology. Using these insights, we propose a deep learning based framework that recommends monitors based on the service properties. Finally, we conduct a user study with engineers from Microsoft which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed framework.

In this paradigm, knowledge graphs play a pivotal role by supplying vital background information and contextual understanding to hybrid intelligence systems. However, due to limitations in local storage capacity, managing large-scale graph data often requires outsourcing to cloud servers. Nevertheless, the use of untrusted cloud servers poses a risk of potential user data leaks. To address these concerns, this paper presents an encryption scheme specifically designed to protect graph data, enabling queries involving intermediate nodes in the shortest path between two nodes within the graph. The proposed scheme ensures the privacy and security of outsourced data by employing a novel method that utilizes padding dictionary structure encryption. This method ensures strict limitations on the cloud server's capabilities, restricting it solely to query operations, it effectively prevents any compromise of user data or unauthorized access to sensitive information, users can securely store and process their graph data on servers, significantly reducing the potential risk of data leakage and unauthorized breaches. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution, practical experiments were conducted using real-world data.","2023-11-17","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","8204-8208","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 China Automation Congress (CAC)","","","","Knowledge graphs; Artificial intelligence; knowledge graph; graph encryption; homomorphic encryption; shortest path queries; Encryption; Outsourcing; Human intelligence; Servers; Dictionaries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 China Automation Congress (CAC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to meet these needs, cloud computing technologies have surfaced as a suitable answer, facilitating effective data sharing and interchange. With semantic information integration playing a crucial role, this is especially important for fully exploiting the advantages of cloud computing in enabling sophisticated analytics and mining for smart grids. In order to analyze grid data for power distribution, this essay proposes integrating the semantic web into a cloud-based research platform. The idea recommends using a service restoration technique to reenergize loads after an electrical failure. This presentation is implemented using FIWARE, a platform composed of modular, open-source building pieces designed for future internet services and applications. Moreover, the SARGON ontology-which was created especially for the energy domain-is used here. We test the integration of semantic data into the cloud-based service restoration application using the IEC61850 data model. This integration provides an access to the distribution grid's field devices. The platform's performance test, measured in terms of computing time and network latency, validates the viability of the suggested solution.

Using this information to recommend satisfactory cloud products is a challenge. Previous studies focused on similar information of users and products while neglecting relevance; therefore, they could not create recommendation approaches that account for functional dependencies among cloud products. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a cloud product set recommendation model based on a hierarchical knowledge graph (KG) with a pre-post correlation of product functionality. There are two main contributions: First, we constructed a cloud product functionality and performance KG using the dependency information of layers and entities to represent complicated pre-post logical connections. The KG was designed according to the cloud service model. Second, we designed an improved PageRank algorithm to obtain the importance weight for each functionality and performance, which replaces the original average method with the proportion of connection weight. We considered the release time of the functionality, launch time of the product, and last update time of the product as crucial factors in the recommendation score to reflect the importance of the functionality and current development stage of the product. Finally, our method recommended a product set based on the weighted scores from the above results. In addition, we constructed a cloud product functionality dataset containing 339 functionalities. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate a closely related set of products, leading to improved accuracy and higher satisfaction compared to mainstream methods.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","120541-120553","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Knowledge graphs; Recommender systems; knowledge graph; cloud product functionality dataset; cloud service; PageRank; Product set recommendation; Electronic commerce; Data models; Companies; Industries; Filtering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using path mining to analyze discontinuous data paths in cloud computing environment, we can find the location and data state of discontinuous data paths.

In this paper, the optimization of discontinuous data path mining based on fuzzy clustering algorithm is studied. In order to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, this paper extracts the semantic directional features of discontinuous data and quantifies them. On the basis of quantization coding, FCM (fuzzy C means) algorithm is adopted to realize the directional beam clustering of semantic ontology features and improve the path mining algorithm. The research results show that the proposed algorithm is used to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, and the root mean square error of the path mining output is low, which shows that the path mining accuracy is higher than the traditional method and the anti-interference performance is strong.","2023-05-29","2025-11-10 09:29:14","2025-11-10 09:29:14","","708-712","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 International Conference on Networking, Informatics and Computing (ICNETIC)","","","","Semantics; Ontologies; Clustering algorithms; Discontinuous data; Fuzzy clustering; Path mining; Feature extraction; Transforms; Classification algorithms; Quantization (signal)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 International Conference on Networking, Informatics and Computing (ICNETIC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exploiting auxiliary information such as a Knowledge Graph (KG) can significantly improve the effectiveness of service recommendations. However, current KG-based service recommendation methods usually merely integrate the knowledge semantic information into the user-service interaction model, which ignores the importance of global structure and does not fully consider the in-depth learning of individual user preferences. To this end, this paper proposes a Multi-Level View Contrastive Learning for Service Recommendation (MCSR) approach to address the above challenges. In particular, unlike traditional approaches that consider only two views, we consider three views, i.e., the global structure view, the local collaboration view, and the semantic view. Specifically, the user-service graph is regarded as the collaboration view, the service-entity graph as the semantic view, and the user-service-entity graph as the structural view. By applying contrastive learning across these views at different levels, MCSR fully leverages graph features and structural information, integrating auxiliary relational semantics into user-service interaction modeling. Furthermore, recognizing that the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly improving recommendation accuracy., since the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy.

Cloud-based security ontologies are organized frameworks that delineate and classify topics pertinent to security in CC settings. They assist in standardizing language and enhance communication, interoperability, and comprehension among diverse stakeholders, including security experts, developers, and organizations. The ontology-based security strategy is one of the security solutions used by relevant parties. Nevertheless, target customers and cloud service providers see it as complex and lacking in security, since the applicable paradigms for various contexts are not clearly defined. Previous research has identified many security ideas that service providers might use, employing several evaluation methodologies. This highlights the growing need for reviewing the literature on Cloud Security Ontology (CSO). This research outlines the current state of the art in cloud computing ontology (CCO) and conducts a comprehensive literature review on the topic. Using the systematic literature review (SLR) approach, we identified 100 papers; 60 were selected based on established criteria, and 25 were assessed to be pertinent to the study. Scholars have shown active interest in four main areas of CC - service description, cloud security (CS), cloud resource management, cloud interoperability, and cloud service discovery - where cloud ontologies have had a significant impact. According to the research, fifteen of the thirty-one methods described in the literature for using ontologies in the cloud domain are still in use in legacy computing settings. The findings reveal several issues with improving company operations in cloud and multi-cloud settings via the use of ontologies. This paper delineates unsolved difficulties and potential future paths for academics in cloud ontology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

However, the sparsity of service data and the presence of noise in interactions make it extremely challenging to accurately capture user preferences. Existing service recommendation methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily rely on ID aggregation, often neglecting the richness of textual semantics and are susceptible to interaction noise, resulting in suboptimal modeling of user-service relationships. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable advantages in capturing textual semantics, current methods struggle to effectively align structural representations with textual representations, limiting improvements in recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-semantic graph diffusion model for service recommendation, DiffMSR, which aims to align textual and structural representations while learning the generation process of interaction graphs in a denoising manner. This approach mitigates data sparsity and effectively reduces noise interference. Specifically, the model leverages LLMs to capture the textual semantic features of service descriptions and integrates them with structured semantic information from knowledge graphs. Through cross-semantic contrastive learning, it achieves heterogeneous semantic alignment. Furthermore, the model introduces a multisemantic diffusion-based generation framework, which iteratively denoises to construct high-quality user-service interaction graphs. This significantly enhances the multi-semantic awareness of user representations, thereby improving recommendation performance. Experiments on public service datasets demonstrate that DiffMSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving improvements of 4.13% and 6.37% in recommendation accuracy and recall, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","2740-2753","","5","18","","IEEE Trans.

Despite advancements in scheduling algorithms, existing methods face critical challenges, including suboptimal energy efficiency, limited adaptability to dynamic cloud environments, and insufficient context-aware decision-making. Recent techniques, such as Meta Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and Energy-Aware Scheduling, show potential but often struggle with high computational complexity, static resource allocation, or scalability issues. These shortcomings result in inefficient resource utilization, elevated energy usage, and difficulties in meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Energy Efficient Semantic Scheduling Framework (ESSF), a novel approach combining semantic reasoning and energy profiling to optimize task scheduling in dynamic cloud environments. The framework integrates three key components: (1) Dynamic Energy Profiling (DEP) for real-time energy monitoring, (2) Semantic Resource Matching (SRM) utilizing knowledge graphs for context-aware allocation, and (3) Adaptive Workload Balancing (AWB) to dynamically redistribute tasks for improved resource utilization and energy efficiency. Experiments using the Google Cluster Trace Dataset demonstrate that ESSF reduces energy consumption by up to 25% compared to traditional methods while achieving 90% resource utilization and 97% SLA compliance. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to overcome existing limitations, offering a scalable, adaptive, and environmentally sustainable solution for task scheduling in cloud computing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","274-281","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

It has constructed numerous domain-specific knowledge graphs related to merchants, companies, accounts, products, and more. AKGP manages trillions of structured knowledge graphs, serving search, recommendation, risk control and other businesses. However, as the demand increasing for various workloads such as graph pattern matching, graph representation learning, and cross-domain knowledge reuse, the existing warehouse systems based on relational DBMS or graph databases are unable to meet the requirements. To address these issues, we propose KGFabric, an industrial-scale knowledge graph management system built on the distributed file system (DFS). KGFabric offers a nearline knowledge storage engine that utilizes a Semantic-enhanced Programmable Graph (SPG) model, which is compatible with the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model. The data is persistently stored in DFS, such as HDFS, which leverages the POSIX file system API, making it suitable for deployment in multi-cloud environment at low cost. KGFabric provides a native graph-based and hybrid storage format that can serve as a shared backend for parallel graph computing systems, significantly accelerating the analysis of multi-workload. Additionally, KGFabric includes a graph fabric framework that minimizes data duplication and guarantees data security. KGFabric is able to manage Peta-scale data and has supported graph fabric and analysis with over 100 billion relations at Ant Group. We conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate the performance of KGFabric. Compared with popular relational DBMS and graph databases, the storage space for semantic relations is reduced by over 90%. The performance of graph fabric improves by 21X in real-world workloads. In multi-hop semantic graph analysis, KGFabric enhances performance by 100X. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","3841-3854","","","17","","","","","","","","VLDB Endowment","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 12 Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Although they are independent entities, they may also be combined in many ways to provide answers - a subject that has been thoroughly researched lately. The number of 'new cloud providers, applications, facilities, management systems, and data' has significantly increased in recent years. The complexity that has resulted from this expansion emphasises the need for new technology in order to efficiently manage and support these varied and many services and resources. As a result, difficulties with 'cloud services and resources' transferability, compatibility, security, choice, negotiation, identity, and specification might arise. Semantic Technologies are a vital tool for reassessing these issues because of their enormous 'cloud computing' capacity. This study uses a variety of sources to examine and evaluate the impact of 'Semantic-Web Technology' in the cloud.

Gaps in monitoring can lead to delay in incident detection and significant negative customer impact. Current process of monitor creation is ad-hoc and reactive in nature. Developers create monitors using their tribal knowledge and, primarily, a trial and error based process. As a result, monitors often have incomplete coverage which leads to production issues, or, redundancy which results in noise and wasted effort. In this work, we address this issue by proposing an intelli-gent monitoring framework that recommends monitors for cloud services based on their service properties. We start by mining the attributes of 30,000+ monitors from 791 production services at Microsoft and derive a structured ontology for monitors. We focus on two crucial dimensions: what to monitor (resources) and which metrics to monitor. We conduct an extensive empirical study and derive key insights on the major classes of monitors employed by cloud services at Microsoft, their associated dimensions, and the interrelationship between service properties and this ontology. Using these insights, we propose a deep learning based framework that recommends monitors based on the service properties. Finally, we conduct a user study with engineers from Microsoft which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed framework. The proposed framework along with the ontology driven projections, succeeded in creating production quality rec-ommendations for majority of resource classes. This was also validated by the users from the study who rated the framework's usefulness as 4.27 out of 5. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","381-391","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 2024 Journal Abbreviation: IEEE/ACM Int.

This study conceptualizes SaaS selection as a multi-criteria combinatorial problem within predefined constraints. To address this, we introduce a hybrid approach incorporating an entire optimization algorithm. Our method leverages semantic and microservice (individual) SaaS descriptions in the Ontology Web Language for Services (OWL-S). Each micro SaaS is linked to compatible SaaS instances (offering similar functionality) in a unified environment, guided by the compatibility concept. A micro-SaaS may not satisfy a particular functional need in specific contexts. However, it is possible to meet customer requirements by combining the available SaaS instances, called virtual SaaS. The chosen SaaS should be the best based on the defined quality and quantitative criteria. Our proposed approach, employing multi-criteria analysis, capitalizes on a dedicated Quality of Service (QoS) ontology tailored for the cloud environment and web applications. Moreover, a simulation design proved that a substantial selection of SaaS(s) could be achieved in a cloud. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","125-131","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Glob.

The primary challenge is how to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) that supports authenticated queries and can be easily maintained by the blockchain.

In this paradigm, knowledge graphs play a pivotal role by supplying vital background information and contextual understanding to hybrid intelligence systems. However, due to limitations in local storage capacity, managing large-scale graph data often requires outsourcing to cloud servers. Nevertheless, the use of untrusted cloud servers poses a risk of potential user data leaks. To address these concerns, this paper presents an encryption scheme specifically designed to protect graph data, enabling queries involving intermediate nodes in the shortest path between two nodes within the graph. The proposed scheme ensures the privacy and security of outsourced data by employing a novel method that utilizes padding dictionary structure encryption. This method ensures strict limitations on the cloud server's capabilities, restricting it solely to query operations, it effectively prevents any compromise of user data or unauthorized access to sensitive information, users can securely store and process their graph data on servers, significantly reducing the potential risk of data leakage and unauthorized breaches. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution, practical experiments were conducted using real-world data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:24","2025-11-10 09:29:24","","8204-8208","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - China Autom.

In order to meet these needs, cloud computing technologies have surfaced as a suitable answer, facilitating effective data sharing and interchange. With semantic information integration playing a crucial role, this is especially important for fully exploiting the advantages of cloud computing in enabling sophisticated analytics and mining for smart grids. In order to analyze grid data for power distribution, this essay proposes integrating the semantic web into a cloud-based research platform. The idea recommends using a service restoration technique to reenergize loads after an electrical failure. This presentation is implemented using FIWARE, a platform composed of modular, open-source building pieces designed for future internet services and applications. Moreover, the SARGON ontology-which was created especially for the energy domain-is used here. We test the integration of semantic data into the cloud-based service restoration application using the IEC61850 data model. This integration provides an access to the distribution grid's field devices. The platform's performance test, measured in terms of computing time and network latency, validates the viability of the suggested solution. The results of these experiments provide as a standard against which to measure the performance of smart energy platforms in the future, therefore advancing the field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:24","2025-11-10 09:29:24","","1295-1299","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Using this information to recommend satisfactory cloud products is a challenge. Previous studies focused on similar information of users and products while neglecting relevance; therefore, they could not create recommendation approaches that account for functional dependencies among cloud products. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a cloud product set recommendation model based on a hierarchical knowledge graph (KG) with a pre-post correlation of product functionality. There are two main contributions: First, we constructed a cloud product functionality and performance KG using the dependency information of layers and entities to represent complicated pre-post logical connections. The KG was designed according to the cloud service model. Second, we designed an improved PageRank algorithm to obtain the importance weight for each functionality and performance, which replaces the original average method with the proportion of connection weight. We considered the release time of the functionality, launch time of the product, and last update time of the product as crucial factors in the recommendation score to reflect the importance of the functionality and current development stage of the product. Finally, our method recommended a product set based on the weighted scores from the above results. In addition, we constructed a cloud product functionality dataset containing 339 functionalities. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate a closely related set of products, leading to improved accuracy and higher satisfaction compared to mainstream methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:24","2025-11-10 09:29:24","","120541-120553","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: S.

Generally speaking, this kind of data has time attribute, and it hopes to show some time-varying characteristics on the basis of keeping the hierarchical structure clear.

Classifying and counting discontinuous data is beneficial to the efficient use of data. In this paper, the optimization of discontinuous data path mining based on fuzzy clustering algorithm is studied. In order to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, this paper extracts the semantic directional features of discontinuous data and quantifies them. On the basis of quantization coding, FCM (fuzzy C means) algorithm is adopted to realize the directional beam clustering of semantic ontology features and improve the path mining algorithm. The research results show that the proposed algorithm is used to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, and the root mean square error of the path mining output is low, which shows that the path mining accuracy is higher than the traditional method and the anti-interference performance is strong. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:25","2025-11-10 09:29:25","","708-712","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Int.

To solve such problems, the implementation of the Data Fabric structure allows you to integrate data and metadata for use on various platforms. The sustainable development of such platforms is facilitated by the use of the Data Fabric mechanism as a built-in system for standardization and coding, the implementation of semantic compatibility, proprietary knowledge graphs and the domain of data values of the transport industry. Data Fabric helps organizations solve complex data problems and use cases by managing their data regardless of application types, platforms, and storage locations, while ensuring seamless data access and sharing in a distributed data environment. The article analyzes the stability of the Data Fabric platform as a domain-oriented decomposition model based on a distributed data architecture with centralized management, but not as a fragmented data warehouse. Using the example of such a decomposition, it is necessary to model an architecture that organizes analytical and other data by areas. In this architecture, the domain's interface with the rest of the organization includes not only operational capabilities, but also access to the analytical data that the domain serves to scale the system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:25","2025-11-10 09:29:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Syst.

These agreements list the service terms and metrics to be agreed upon by the service providers and the customers. Current cloud SLAs are text documents that require significant manual effort to parse and determine if providers meet the SLAs. Moreover, due to the lack of standardization, providers differ in the way they define the terms and metrics, making it more difficult to compare different provider SLAs. We have developed a novel framework to significantly automate the process of extracting knowledge embedded in cloud SLAs and representing it in a semantically rich knowledge graph helping the user to make a calculated decision in choosing a provider. Our framework captures the key terms, measures, and deontic rules, in the form of obligations and permissions present in the cloud SLAs. In this article, we discuss our framework, technique, and challenges in automating the cloud services agreement.

Existing methods have either scalability issues by requiring that patients grant access to their medical data or a trust issue by having a single authority, thereby creating the problem of a single point of attack. Hence there is a need to develop an EHR system that addresses these bottlenecks for safe, secure, and easy cloud-based EHR management. To address these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that allows policy-based multi-authority access permission to Electronic Health Record systems used by multiple care providers from various places or organizations.

Providers of Cloud Computing services for Data Mining publish the descriptions and definitions in many formats and often not compatible with other providers. From a functional point of view, having the possibility to describe complete Data Mining services is fundamental to maintain the usability and especially the portability of these services independently of the software/hardware support or even the differences between cloud platforms. The main objective of this article is to design a Data Mining service definition which allows to compose with a single and simple definition a complete service, in such way a data mining workflow can be ported and deployed in different providers or even in a Market Place of this type of ready-to-consume services. This article presents a semantic scheme for the definition and description of complete Data Mining services considering both the management of the service by the provider (price, authentication, Service Level Agreement,...) and the definition of the Data Mining workflow as a service. It represents a solid contribution for paving the way to the standardization and industrialization of Data Mining services. To asses the validity of the scheme a list of services from Data Mining providers have been described and an example of a full service for a Random Forest algorithm has been defined as a service. In addition, a practical scenario has been developed, creating a deployment platform for Data Mining services to give functional support to the scheme, illustrating the practical benefits of the proposal for the end user. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-10 09:29:26","2025-11-10 09:29:26","","945-955","","2","15","","IEEE Trans.

Based on analysis, conversion, extraction and refinement for the big data, a disease can be prevented and group behavior can be predicted. However, each user's private data is also an element in big data. Users must provide private data to the service providers to meet their functional requirements. To gain economic benefits, some SaaS service providers have not been authorized to collect and analyze the user's sensitive private data, as a result, the user's private data is disclosed. In this paper, we propose a private data chain disclosure discovery method, to prevent a user's sensitive privacy information from being illegally disclosed. First, we measure the similarity degree and cost of the disclosure of the private data. Second, according to the similarity degree and cost of disclosure, the disclosure chain and key private data are detected in the process of interaction between user and SaaS service.

With the increasing availability of genomic data, traditional bioinformatic tools require substantial computational time and the creation of ever-larger indices each time a researcher seeks to gain insight from the data. To address these challenges, we pre-computed important relationships between biological entities spanning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and captured this information in a relational database. The database can be queried across hundreds of millions of entities and returns results in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. In this paper, we describe Functional Genomics Platform (formerly known as OMXWare), a comprehensive database relating genotype to phenotype for bacterial life. Continually updated, the Functional Genomics Platform today contains data derived from 200,000 curated, self-consistently assembled genomes. The database stores functional data for over 68 million genes, 52 million proteins, and 239 million domains with associated biological activity annotations from Gene Ontology, KEGG, MetaCyc, and Reactome. The Functional Genomics Platform maps all of the many-To-many connections between each biological entity including the originating genome, gene, protein, and protein domain. Various microbial studies, from infectious disease to environmental health, can benefit from the rich data and connections. We describe the data selection, the pipeline to create and update the Functional Genomics Platform, and the developer tools (Python SDK and REST APIs)which allow researchers to efficiently study microbial life at scale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-10 09:29:26","2025-11-10 09:29:26","","940-952","","2","19","","IEEE/ACM Trans.

Since the attributes of the Users will change with time, the encryption policies adopted may also vary. For large EHR systems, it is often necessary to search through the encrypted data in realtime and perform client-side computations without decrypting all patient records. This paper describes our novel cloud-based EHR system that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) combined with Semantic Web technologies to facilitate differential access to an EHR, thereby ensuring only Users with valid attributes can access a particular field of the EHR. The system also includes searchable encryption using keyword index and search trapdoor, which allows querying EHR fields without decrypting the entire patient record. The attribute revocation feature is efficiently managed in our EHR by delegating the revision of the secret key and ciphertext to the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). Our methodology incorporates advanced security features that eliminate malicious use of EHR data and contributes significantly towards ensuring secure digital health systems on the Cloud. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","38-47","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

So, vendor lock-in problem appeared. One solution to this problem is to use generic APIs with specific adapters. However, any update in a PaaS specific-API makes its corresponding adapter is unusable which causes, what we call, API synchronization problem. Therefore, STAGER (SemanTic-based GenERation of Generic-API Adapters) framework is proposed. STAGER framework provides a semi-automatic adapter generation process, which generates specific adapters of generic APIs for PaaS services (e.g., blob storage and datastore services) for target PaaS platforms. The adapter generation process is based on semantic annotations of the generic APIs and their corresponding PaaS specific-APIs. In order to evaluate STAGER framework, two generic APIs for blob storage and NoSQL datastore services have been proposed. STAGER framework is used to generate the adapters of these generic APIs for two PaaS platforms: Google App Engine (GAE) and Windows Azure. Although there is some overhead for semantically annotating the PaaS APIs, the evaluation results prove the feasibility of STAGER framework and promote the usage of the generated adapters for implementing portable cloud applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","903-914","","","14","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 3 Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Trans.

In some circumstances, the keywords that the user searches on are only semantically related to the data rather than via an exact or fuzzy match. Hence, semantic-based keyword search over encrypted cloud data becomes of paramount importance. However, existing schemes usually depend upon a global dictionary, which not only affects the accuracy of search results but also causes inefficiency in data updating. Additionally, although compound keyword search is common in practice, the existing approaches only process them as single words, which split the original semantics and achieve low accuracy. To address these limitations, we initially propose a compound concept semantic similarity (CCSS) calculation method to measure the semantic similarity between compound concepts. Next, by integrating CCSS with Locality-Sensitive Hashing function and the secure $k$k-Nearest Neighbor scheme, a semantic-based compound keyword search (SCKS) scheme is proposed. SCKS achieves not only semantic-based search but also multi-keyword search and ranked keyword search. Additionally, SCKS also eliminates the predefined global library and can efficiently support data update. The experimental results on real-world dataset indicate that SCKS introduces low overhead on computation and the search accuracy outperforms the existing schemes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","850-863","","","14","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 3 Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Trans.

This new big data-centric service model aims to provide customer-oriented massive services by combining both physical and virtualized resources from different domains. Although such complex ecosystem is able to process, encapsulate and offer huge volumes of data as services, its management operations are beyond the ability of human administrators, due to several challenges including the big services' large-scale nature and complexity, the heterogeneity of their components (e.g., services, data sources, connected things), the dynamicity and uncertainty of their hosting cloud environments. To cope with the lack of understanding regarding big services capabilities, we propose to describe them using a novel meta-model for the quality of big services (QoBS). We also take advantage of a recent technology called knowledge graphs, to represent the big service information (service descriptions, services' and data sources' quality levels, management policies) as a heterogeneous information network.

However, this has been faced with several challenges, such as disparate nature of existing solutions and lack of scalability in proportion to web scale. With a holistic perspective to web content semantic annotation, this paper focuses on leveraging cloud computing for these challenges. To achieve this, a set of requirements towards holistic semantic annotation on the web is defined and mapped with cloud computing mechanisms to facilitate them. Technical specification for the requirements is critically reviewed and examined against each of the cloud computing mechanisms, in relation to their technical functionalities. Hence, a mapping is established if the cloud computing mechanism's functionalities proffer a solution for implementation of a requirement's technical specification. The result is a cloud computing capability model for holistic semantic annotation which presents an approach towards delivering large-scale semantic annotation on the web via a cloud platform. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","335-340","","","2020-December","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Int.

However, these records cannot be queried without decrypting the entire record. This incurs a huge amount of burden in network bandwidth and the client-side computation. As the volume of cloud-based EHRs reaches Big Data levels, it is essential to search over these encrypted patient records without decrypting them to ensure that the medical caregivers can efficiently access the EHRs. This is especially critical if the caregivers have access to only certain sections of the patient EHR and should not decrypt the whole record. In this paper, we present our novel approach that facilitates searchable encryption of large EHR systems using Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) and multi-keyword search techniques. Our framework outsources key search features to the cloud side. This way, our system can perform keyword searches on encrypted data with significantly reduced costs of network bandwidth and client-side computation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","4075-4082","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

Unregulated and rampant collection of user and usage data by applications led to concerns on privacy, trust, and ethics. This has resulted in several governments and organizations across geographies to frame laws on data (e.g., the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) that govern and define boundaries for the storage, processing and transitioning of data; and thereby safeguard the interests of its citizens. Data Sovereignty and Data Localization are two important aspects, which deal with the adherence to the laws and governance structures, that define where and how data is collected and processed. The applicability of different laws depends upon several attributes such as the nature, type, and purpose of data. Non-compliance to laws/regulations can lead to serious repercussions for enterprises, ranging from hefty penalties to loss of brand value. Ensuring that all of their applications are complaint to various laws and regulations is non-trivial. Enterprises have to deal with a plethora of laws (that are constantly evolving) and are often confused even in correctly identifying all the applicable laws for their context leave alone ensuring compliance to regulations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a knowledge graph based data sovereignty governance framework that assists in classifying data and in identifying the relevant applicable laws. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","303-306","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

The data security of multiple cloud-based services is also susceptible to these threats, due to the high dependency on traditional routing protocols. Although a number of hijacking detection techniques have been recently proposed, no existing system has effectively addressed the problem of detecting malicious transit Autonomous System (AS) services in any detected hijacking occurrences. The ability to locate and isolate malicious services is critical for conducting a necessary mitigation strategy at an early stage, to minimise the impact of the attack, to restore cloud services quickly. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time processing method, so-called Ontological Graph Identification (OGI), for detecting IP prefix hijacking of nodes and suspicious transit nodes caused by the hijacked nodes through ASs. The proposed method is evaluated using the two public datasets of RIPE RIS and RouteView. Experimental results revealed improved performance for the detection of malicious transit nodes compared with peer techniques. It is, therefore, shown that the proposed method has utility in automating the process of investigating nodes with suspicious activities in real network systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","1164-1174","","","15","","IEEE Trans.

Nevertheless, security risks remain major concerns. One of the main challenges is how to evaluate the security level of cloud services. Among the problems arising are the large variety of knowledge associated with the security domain and the heterogeneity of cloud services descriptions. An effective solution to such problems is ontologies. Ontologies provide a more structured and formal representation of a particular domain, which will help to reduce the conceptual ambiguity and enable automatic reasoning functionalities. In this paper, we propose an ontology for cloud services security evaluation based on industry standards and best practices. Some of the core concepts included in the ontology are the target, criteria, yardstick, data gathering techniques and data synthesis approaches. The concepts are grouped into five general categories, namely: context, assumptions, external factors, activities, and outcomes. The ontology is implemented using Protégé tool and validated through different uses case scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","1012-1018","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Thus, a uniform description of Cloud services would be needed. The aim of this study is to provide a new ontology for uniform description of Cloud services coming from heterogeneous sources. The proposed model takes into account the different relationships and dependencies between services across Cloud's layers. These dependencies are represented by the different constraints of composition and deployment. To validate our proposal, qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted. The qualitative evaluation is carried out by making comparisons with both state-of-the-art works and the Bitnami platform according to some criteria.

Due to the development of big data with high dimensionality, data storage possibility over cloud has created large scope in recent times. Document clustering is the fundamental topic that turned into an indispensable component in many areas like cloud computing. Document clustering partitions the document into significant classes or groups for retrieving the relevant document. Many researchers used the factorization methods and ontologies for internal and external knowledge based document clustering. However, existing methods failed to provide the semantic feature construction and leads to the information loss while covering all the ideas in documents. In order to address these problems, different document clustering techniques in cloud has been reviewed in this paper. In addition to that Document clustering by Entropy-based Boosting with Projection Neural Feature (EB-PNF) method is presented. The proposed method involves two stages. They are, similar document identification based on semantic similarity score, feature extraction which includes the extraction of both single and multi-label features based on the precision, recall and computational complexity to prove that EB-PNF method produces high-quality clusters comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","1163-1169","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

To address both these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that enables policy based multi-authority access authorization to EHR systems accessed by multiple care providers from different locations or organizations. This framework, which resides on the Edge, has been built using the Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA-ABE) and Semantic Web technologies to provide a secure, semantically rich approach to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations who manage different attributes of end users using a shared dataset.

To effectively manage and integrate security requirements in the cloud, the provider and customer needs to negotiate and agree upon the applied security policies. However, there is no standard way of expressing cloud security policies in a vendor-agnostic manner. Cloud security and privacy policies are often stated in an informal and ad-hoc manner, which leads to policy conflicts, incompleteness, ambiguity and inconsistencies. In this paper, we present CERBERUS, a framework for representing cloud security and privacy policies and detecting potential problems in the policies. CERBERUS adopts an object-oriented approach and consists of an ontology and notation, policies, guidelines and rules, and a tool for capturing and detecting policy errors. Using CERBERUS, policies can be analyzed for potential problems, including policy conflicts, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness. An application of CERBERUS shows that it indeed helps to discover policy errors, which otherwise would go undetected or in many cases would be detected a posteriori at runtime. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","214-221","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

The proposed approach aims to manage Cloud SaaS services for an efficient publication by classifying them into sets according to their domain to reduce the search space then interconnecte the SaaS services of the same domain in a Semantic Network using the similarity measure (Input/Output similarity) between concepts.

While several tools exist for providing semantic annotation to web documents, the techniques used in these tools vary very widely. Also, the mode of implementation and the solutions offered by the tools are inconsistent with each other leaving end users confused on the appropriate tool for use to deliver their expected results. Based on these, a holistic perspective to the development of semantic annotation tools as well as their implementation is necessary. This is to ensure uniformity in the expected end results and guarantee a continuous, dynamic and consistent semantic annotation for web documents; encompassing the complete needs of end users. To achieve this, cloud computing is proposed for the delivery of semantic annotation as a holistic service, as it provides an enabling environment for processing the vast amount of data required to annotate web documents. Also, cloud computing essential characteristics such as ubiquitous network access, rapid elasticity and on-demand self-service are very necessary to achieve a holistic semantic annotation service for documents on the web.

While the current workflow management systems implement mostly different complicated graphical tasks based on advanced distributed solutions (e.g., cloud computing and grid computation), workflow knowledge acquisition from texts using case-based reasoning represents more expressive and semantic case representations. We propose in this context, an ontology-based workflow extraction framework to acquire processual knowledge from texts. Our methodology extends the classic NLP techniques to extract and disambiguate complex tasks and relations in texts. Using a graph-based representation of workflows and a domain ontology, our extraction process uses a context-aware approach to recognize workflow components in texts: data and control flows. We applied our framework in a technical domain in bioinformatics: i.e., phylogenetic analyses. An evaluation based on workflow semantic similarities in a gold standard proves that our approach provides promising results in the process extraction domain.

For this purpose, we developed SAM - the Semantic-aware Middleware - and the SAM Store. The latter resembles a registry. It allows component providers to publish semantically enriched interfaces and to offer corresponding local and remote implementations. SAM makes use of the SAM Store to match local interprocess communication (IPC) messages transparently against local and remote components. This architecture facilitates the integration of powerful, but resource-intensive remote components, which may be prioritized over local ones, and fosters various patterns of cooperation that demonstrate useful solutions in the area of MCC.

Existing authorization models follow a patient centric approach for EHR management where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients' end. This however creates a significant overhead for the patient who has to authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given the multiple personnel involved in providing care and that at times the patient may not be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need of developing a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy cloud-based EHR management. We have developed a novel, centralized, attribute based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based EHR's access authority to the medical providers. In this paper, we describe this novel ABE approach as well as the prototype system that we have created to illustrate it. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","932-935","","","2018-July","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

Semantics of services from different venders may be described by distributed domain ontologies. Distributed knowledge brings difficulty to competition and cooperation among services, and hampers the evolution of a service ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a distributed knowledge based evolution model (DKEM) to promote competition and cooperation among services from different venders. DKEM considers stability as key factor in competition, and a stability evaluation model is designed to compute stability of services, venders, and service-based processes according to service invocation histories. Based on the evaluation model, two evolution patterns are given, and they can automatically explore new and more stable cooperation among services by means of runtime self-adaption mechanism. A prototype system for DKEM is implemented and a series of experiments show that DKEM is effective for competition and cooperation among services with distributed knowledge, and, evolved processes have higher stability and response efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

While this 'ease' is appealing, several issues arise: 1) Which Cloud Providers (CPs) offer the best infrastructure at a fair budget? 2) I am no Cloud expert, then what are the characteristics of the infrastructure which best fit my application? To answer these questions, one must solve a resource management problem, that is, the allocation of computing, storage, networking and (indirectly) cost resources to a set of applications such that the performance objectives of the application are fulfilled. There are many approaches which answer separately these questions but there is no comprehensive and easily usable solution for these issues. MANeUveR solves them by integrating the following components: 1) a Web User Interface offers the end user the possibility to describe his application in terms of interactions between components and their software and hardware requirements, 2) an Offers Management System, through a crawler, periodically updates an ontology with infrastructure and services details from different CPs, 3) a Recommendation Engine provides a (sub) optimal solution for application deployment in the CP infrastructure regarding the leasing price of the virtual machines needed for deployment and their characteristics. Using a secure-billing e-mail service, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","288-295","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Int.

So, there is a need for re-establishing the structures of openly published data on the web by giving various specifications or frameworks of data published in cyberspace. With the aim of better utilization of web data and transition from keyword-based search to contextual search, the Semantic web has emerged as a key milestone. In this direction, Tim Berners Lee has proposed the conventions namely RDF and SPARQL for linking and querying the machine-processable shared data on the web and also a 5-star linked data scheme to distinguish the type of data on web based on its linking properties. This paper presents a Framework for Linking and querying open datasets on government portals, embedding semantics in the data by RDF alignment using state-of-art tools such as OpenRefine and Twinkle tool. The 5-Star scheme has been discussed and practical demonstration of enriching data is given. This clearly puts forward the transition from web of documents to web of data. This paper also presents the framework for translating the data in datasets to the graph based RDF data in Triple format. This translated data is then queried using standard SPARQL Queries showcasing the linked data fetched in tuple format. The data-graph of the resultant linked data is also presented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","568-573","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

For these reasons it would be useful to automate, as much as possible, requirements analysis. In this work we propose an automatic classification and modelling of requirements that are expressed in a natural language form, and an automatic identification of cloud services categories from requirements in order to support the development of a cloud application.

However, relinquishing control of sensitive medical data by delegating their storage and processing to third-party cloud providers naturally raises significant security concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise appropriate policies that infuse adequate access controls in cloud services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of these services, coupled with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinder the formulation of effective and interoperable policies that are appropriate for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work adopts the ontological templates proposed in [5] for the representation of access control policies in the medical sector. By capturing the knowledge that must be infused into an access control policy, these templates sufficiently address the needs of the underlying domain of application in which such a policy is to be enforced; at the same time, they facilitate developers in infusing adequate access controls to their cloud applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:36","2025-11-10 09:29:36","","805-810","","","2017-June","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily.

Proving an SLA violation is considered to be a complex operation to the cloud consumer. This task gets more and more difficult to the consumers as they use services from multiple providers, each with its own monitoring policies. In order to implicitly help the consumer monitor the SLA and detect violations, it is necessary to implement some advanced SLA management strategies. Ontological representation and reasoning techniques in SLA management may be beneficial to the evaluation of the QoS. In this regard, we propose a monitoring approach with a new semantic SLA modeling for cloud computing. Our approach aims to help cloud consumers monitor the SLA documents and detect violations by considering the semantic meaning of SLA concepts and taking profit from the power of reasoning techniques. This maintains a reliable QoS and respects the SLA parameters.

To manage service performance, consumers have to validate rules embedded in cloud legal contracts, such as Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Privacy Policies, that are available as text documents. Currently this analysis requires significant time and manual labor and is thus inefficient. We propose a cognitive assistant that can be used to manage cloud legal documents by automatically extracting knowledge (terms, rules, constraints) from them and reasoning over it to validate service performance. In this paper, we present this Question and Answering (Q&A) system that can be used to analyze and obtain information from the SLA documents. We have created a knowledgebase of Cloud SLAs from various providers which forms the underlying repository of our Q&A system.

However, Cloud computing breaks the organization perimeters. When data resides in the Cloud, they reside outside the organizational bounds. This leads users to a loos of control over their data and raises reasonable security concerns that slow down the adoption of Cloud computing. Is the Cloud service provider accessing the data? Is it legitimately applying the access control policy defined by the user? This paper presents a data-centric access control solution with enriched role-based expressiveness in which security is focused on protecting user data regardless the Cloud service provider that holds it. Novel identity-based and proxy re-encryption techniques are used to protect the authorization model. Data is encrypted and authorization rules are cryptographically protected to preserve user data against the service provider access or misbehavior. The authorization model provides high expressiveness with role hierarchy and resource hierarchy support. The solution takes advantage of the logic formalism provided by Semantic Web technologies, which enables advanced rule management like semantic conflict detection.

A key challenge related to composition of such multi-organizational business processes and workflows is posed by the security and access control policies of the underlying organizational domains. In this paper, we propose a framework for verifying secure composability of distributed workflows in an autonomous multi-domain environment. The objective of workflow composability verification is to ensure that all the users or processes executing the designated workflow tasks conform to the time-dependent security policy specifications of all collaborating domains. A key aspect of such verification is to determine the time-dependent schedulability of distributed workflows, assumed to be invoked on a recurrent basis. We use a two-step approach for verifying secure workflow composability. In the first step, a distributed workflow is decomposed into domain-specific projected workflows and is verified for conformance with the respective domain's security and access control policy. In the second step, the cross-domain dependencies amongst the workflow tasks performed by different collaborating domains are verified. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","478-493","","5","14","","IEEE Trans.

This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat.

One of the possible solutions is the use of data anonymization techniques, which performs an important role in data privacy protection. There are several techniques and algorithms to implement data anonymization. However, specifications and guidelines to guide and standardize the use of these resources are needed. These guidelines, called anonymization policies, are considered an important asset in organizations that want to protect their customer personal data. Although the use of data anonymization brings great benefits, there are no clear directions for data anonymization policies, which ends up lim-iting its adoption by companies and organizations. This work presents a generic anonymization policy to be used in cloud and big data platforms. It also presents a draft ontology with explicit formal specifications for data anonymization policies. This ontology has three main intentions: (i) to standardize the use of data anonymization policies; (ii) share common understanding of the structure of data anonymization among people; (iii) enable reuse of data anonymization policies.

To ensure data confidentiality and fine-grained access control in cloud-based environments, stored data and resources needs to be re-encrypted periodically or based on special mechanisms such as revoked user-based or manual re-encryption. Managing the process of re-encryption is a challenging issue that involves many limitations such as time management, resource confidentiality, and level of access. Accordingly, a multi-level re-encryption model based on policy management has been presented in this paper to ensure data security in clouds. The proposed model uses a policy-based ontology to generate, manage and apply re-encryption policies based on the characteristics of resources, sensitivity of data and capabilities of service provider. The results of comprehensive performance and security analysis of proposed model shows this model increases the reliability of re-encryption processes in cloud storages considerably and provides an efficient policy management for re-encryption tasks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","15-21","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

These documents are generated following a process of negotiation during which the client chooses a subset of clauses among choices predefined by the provider on a 'take it or leave it' basis. However, the heterogeneity between client requests and provider offers may result in inappropriate SLA. In addition, the cloud service context may change over the time which causes a client requirements adjustment and therefore, the SLA remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cloud SLA negotiation and re-negotiation approach that integrate a semantic mapping between client requests and provider offers with the aim of generating a suitable SLA document.

The pregnant women are monitored by physicians benefiting their experience in last months of pregnancy to predict certain risks in premature birth. The paper presents a solution to prevent high risk situations, using ontology as support in profiling pregnant women with possible pregnancy risks. Based on ontology and available medical database of one of the largest maternity hospitals in Timisoara (Bega) we create profiles of women focusing on cases with problems and high potential risks, using as tool the open source Protégé for ontology and Visual Studio.Net for the supporting application. The ontology creates links between the characteristics of pregnant women, medical history, disease and possible problems that may occur during pregnancy. The ontology is used in an application stored in cloud to be accessed by physicians from different locations. Based on this information the application creates women profiles matching the risk they may be exposed to. The application is in tests in Bega Hospital.

However, currently, the CABAN paradigm in the healthcare domain is facing increasing difficulty in handling the huge amount of sensor data that the body sensor devices generate from diverse Smart home applications. Therefore, the challenging is now timely storing, processing, and analyzing of the sensor data in real time to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the caregivers or Smart home applications. QoS, here, is the capacity to support diverse Smart home applications in healthcare with different priorities, performance, and resource requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast and robust cloud resource allocation model for body sensor devices to ensure QoS for Smart home healthcare applications. We develop the proposed resource allocation algorithm using agent-based modeling (ABM) and ontology. There are few works, which consider ABM and ontology for resource allocation in CABAN platform. Moreover, we used an ABM tool called NetLogo to implement the proposed resource allocation model. The results from the implementation were compared with the results of existing algorithms and found to be promising. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","13213-13224","","","5","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: M.M.

Therefore, SOAS services can be easily discovered (i.e. by other services), queried by Semantic Web query languages (e.g. SPARQL), checked by reasoners (e.g. Pellet) for consistency or inferring new (hidden) relationships and, finally, be used by service orchestration mechanisms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","66-69","","","2017-November","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.IEEE Int.

Security issues in cloud are very challenging, as the data are roaming without any control. The need to keep the security as well as privacy of the information in the cloud becomes a critical issue. On the basis of cloud architectures we can specify the security rules for the web application attacks. In this paper we go through study, design and purpose of ontology containing encryption algorithms. Here ontology describes the security rule specification. Encryption algorithm describes comparision of performance among different algorithms. The main focus of this kind of work is to present a study of cloud security policy using some encryption algorithm based on ontology. This study will follow the ontology framework build for security policy rules. This paper also discusses cloud based web services attacks, design of semantic rules, and detection of malicious traffic over internet as well as tools for handling ontology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","24-29","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Int.

While one cloud provider is good at one or a few services, other providers might be good at other services. Cloud users eventually want to consume most advantageous resources across multiple providers with the best price while avoiding vendor lock-in. Cloud users also need to safeguard their most valuable digital asset, their data, against cloud outage, which can happen to any vendor. This could mean using the same type of resources across multiple cloud providers. Moreover, cloud providers are continuously changing and evolving their services. Cloud users can only take advantage of these changes if they are able to relocate and real-locate resources using an autonomous and vendor independent tool. We propose a vendor-independent cloud provisioning tool that utilizes an ontology-based semantic reasoning to acquire the best feasible cloud resources for cloud users. In this paper, we outline an ontology subset for purchasing cloud resources or services based on price, user transaction volume, preference, quality of service and Service Layer Agreements (SLA). The proposed ontology is outlined in a case scenario followed by an applied algorithm for negotiating resource purchase between cloud consumer client and cloud vendor provisioning services. Such ontology can be used in inter-cloud federation API for monitoring and acquiring and maintaining the most advantageous cloud resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","466-472","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mishmash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:38","2025-11-10 09:29:38","","987-994","","5","8","","Int.

Nevertheless, due to security concerns, enterprises are reluctant to migrate their operations to the cloud. In addition, the proliferation of cloud services transforms the enterprise IT environment into a complex ecosystem of collaborating services. One way to tame this complexity and alleviate the security concerns is to rely on policies that regulate the deployment, delivery and governance of cloud services. However, the heterogeneity inherent in such services, coupled with the dynamic nature of cloud environments, hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable policies. This paper proposes a generic framework for the definition and representation of policies that are enforceable across diverse administrative domains and are amenable to automated correctness checks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:38","2025-11-10 09:29:38","","277-284","","","0","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

In this highly dynamic scenario, both providers and consumers need to formalize their contractual and legal relationship, creating service level agreements. Although there exist some proposals that provide models to describe that relationship, they usually only cover technical aspects, not providing explicit semantics to the agreement terms. Furthermore, these models cannot be effectively shared on the Web, since they do not actually follow Web principles. These drawbacks hamper take-up and automatic analysis. In this article, we introduce Linked USDL Agreement, a semantic model to specify, manage and share service level agreement descriptions on the Web. This model is part of the Linked USDL family of ontologies that can describe not only technical but also business related aspects of services, incorporating Web principles. We validate our proposal by describing agreements in computational and non-computational scenarios, namely cloud computing and business process outsourcing services. Moreover, we evaluate the actual coverage and expressiveness of Linked USDL Agreement comparing it with existing models. In order to foster its adoption and effectively manage the service level agreement lifecycle, we present an implemented tool that supports creation, automatic analysis, and publication on the Web of agreement descriptions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","52-65","","1","10","","IEEE Trans.

Nowadays, such solutions consist mostly on ICT developments, which permit the collection, distribution, integration, analysis, and manipulation of heterogeneous data. The under way Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project targets the development of cloud-enabled tools for supporting the SMEs supply network optimization of manufacturing and logistic assets. The C2NET solution includes the implementation of paradigms as e.g. cloud computing or service-oriented and event-driven architectures, used for wide data integration. Among its requirements, the C2NET platform needs a solution for catch, process and react to events triggered in different locations of collaborative manufacturing networks, which are endowed with devices that permits the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This paper presents the architecture and main functionality of a knowledge-based approach that allows processing supply chain events handled by CPS devices. The main component of the presented solution is the SECA ontology, which is a knowledge base that can be updated at runtime. The main purpose of the ontology is to describe events, their status and the actions to be performed once a set of events are triggered in certain order. This research work offers a solution that can be employed by the C2NET platform not only to catch and process events; but also to notify linked data consumers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","4877-4883","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IECON Proc","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 5; Conference name: 42nd Conference of the Industrial Electronics Society, IECON 2016; Conference location: Florence; Palazzo dei Congressi; Conference sponsors: IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES); Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); CODEN: IEPRE</p>","","","Ontology; SPARQL; Cyber-physical systems; Event processing; Knowledge-based system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IECON Proceedings (Industrial Electronics Conference)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a database partitioning approach to logically and physically separate data and distribute the partitions across several different cloud providers is applied. This data distribution is called fixed vertical partitioning and distribution approach (FVPD), as data schemes are vertically partitioned and distributed across various different cloud providers. Hence, this framework uses a security-by-distribution approach to storing sensitive data securely and privacy-ware in all possible cloud deployment models and thus, it provides a solution to improve the level of security and privacy. The proposed FVPD approach also becomes viable in the context of LOD and the Semantic Web. Furthermore, in relevant literature no approach in this context has been dealing with security and privacy so far. Therefore, this work transfers the FVPD approach from relational databases to Semantic Web Frameworks (Apache Jena, Sesame, etc.) that provide storage engines for RDF data and corresponding SPARQL endpoints. Above that, the query performance of such a federated environment is compared to a non-partitioned and non-distributed environment. For this, an adapted version of the TPC-W benchmark is used. Thus, this work shows how the query performance is affected when relational database data are exposed as SPARQL endpoints in RDF-based form and how the FVPD approach influences the query performance. Finally, it illustrates a mechanism to improve the level of security and privacy through a security-by-distribution approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","241-247","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

This new shift in the way that IT re-sources are offered to the user brings new challenges, such as cloud service discovery. Nowadays, cloud users are faced with a dilemma as they have an abundant choice of cloud services. Moreover, many cloud providers offer a range of services which deliver similar functionality. Locating the best and most appropriate cloud service with a suitable and capable provider is a primary concern for any consumer. In order to clearly comprehend the scope of this problem, a thorough analysis of the limitations of cloud service discovery approaches is required which, in turn, will empower researchers to deliver better solutions for consumers to make an informed decision and choose the right service. This paper presents an overview of the current cloud service discovery trends and challenges in recent studies. Additionally, the reviewed approaches are classified according to service discovery architecture and techniques. Furthermore, these approaches are compared and analysed from several perspectives including approach model/architecture, service type, ontology representation (domain, language, and reasoning), dynamic discovery model, evaluation model, user's preferences techniques, data updates, and public repositories. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","1049-1056","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

However, this can also create an array of issues, such as complex architectures, security, service provisioning in cases of resources failures/disaster, etc. To mitigate the impact and minimize trade-offs, we proposed an ontology-based framework to provide support for a resiliency mechanism in the hybrid cloud.

In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that has the capability to automatically identify cloud services aiming at improving the accuracy when searching cloud services in real environments. Our search engine can detect cloud services effectively from the Web sources. Furthermore, we focus on learning the cloud service features, such as similarity function, semantic ontology and cloud service components to identify the cloud services.

However, most existing works on encrypted search over outsourced cloud data follow the model of 'one size fits all' and ignore personalized search intention. Moreover, most of them support only exact keyword search, which greatly affects data usability and user experience. So how to design a searchable encryption scheme that supports personalized search and improves user search experience remains a very challenging task. In this paper, for the first time, we study and solve the problem of personalized multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data (PRSE) while preserving privacy in cloud computing. With the help of semantic ontology WordNet, we build a user interest model for individual user by analyzing the user's search history, and adopt a scoring mechanism to express user interest smartly. To address the limitations of the model of 'one size fit all' and keyword exact search, we propose two PRSE schemes for different search intentions.

However, the existing RDF database engines are not scalable and are less reliable in heterogeneous clouds. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Acacia-RDF which is a scalable distributed RDF graph database engine developed with X10 programming language to solve this issue. Acacia-RDF partitions the RDF data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable SPARQL processor for Acacia-RDF which operates on top of partitioned RDF data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the implementation of scalable graph algorithms such as Triangle counting with such partitioned data sets. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of LUBM RDF benchmark data sets and make a comparison of Acacia's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-RDF scales well with LUBM data sets. Acacia-RDF reported approximately 2 seconds elapsed time on 4 places for running the first and third queries of the LUBM benchmark on LUBM scale 40 data set.

Multiple issues and challenges in discovering cloud services appear due to the lack of the cloud service description standardization. In fact, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services while proposing ontologies. However, since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology (CSO), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. This paper contribution is threefold.

Meanwhile, in the back-end, offline ETL processes take care of integrating and preparing the data. In this paper we explain a workflow and the results of a benchmark that examines which Linked Data storage solution and setup should be chosen for different dataset sizes to optimize the cost-effectiveness of the entire ETL process. The benchmark executes diversified stress tests on the storage solutions. The results include an in-depth analysis of four mature Linked Data solutions with commercial support and full SPARQL 1.1 compliance. Whereas traditional benchmarks studies generally deploy the triple stores on premises using high-end hardware, this benchmark uses publicly available cloud machine images for reproducibility and runs on commodity hardware. All stores are tested using their default configuration. In this setting Virtuoso shows the best performance in general. The other tree stores show competitive results and have disjunct areas of excellence. Finally, it is shown that each store's performance heavily depends on the structural properties of the queries, giving an indication of where vendors can focus their optimization efforts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:29:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Among the performance QoS parameters, mainly response-time and throughput could be modulated to provide very efficient services for cloud users. As per user's requirement, the service provider's recommendation of appropriate Web services to the end-users with proper QoS satisfaction is one of the critical issues. This can be recommended to end-users in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) under Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) of WS-Policy. Generally, the matrix of collected QoS parameter values is sparse and the accurate prediction of the missing QoS values is important for the recommendation of appropriate web services to the end users. To address this issue, we worked out an artificial neural network model for the prediction of missing QoS-values using past QoS performance parameter data. In this current work, the performances of different learning algorithms of ANN are analyzed for enhanced prediction of QoS performance values. The ANN model with Bayesian-Regularization is found to be better performing when compared to other learning algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:41","2025-11-10 09:29:41","","414-419","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Analysis of monitoring data delivers insights of the system's workload and usage pattern and ensures workloads are operating at optimum levels. The analysis process involves data query and extraction, data analysis, and result visualization. Since the volume of monitoring data is big, these operations require a scalable and reliable architecture to extract, aggregate, and analyze data in an arbitrary range of granularity. Ultimately, the results of analysis become the knowledge of the system and should be shared and communicated. This paper presents our cloud service architecture that explores a search cluster for data indexing and query. We develop REST APIs that the data can be accessed by different analysis modules. This architecture enables extensions to integrate with software frameworks of both batch processing (such as Hadoop) and stream processing (such as Spark) of big data. The analysis results are structured in Semantic Media Wiki pages in the context of the monitoring data source and the analysis process. This cloud architecture is empirically assessed to evaluate its responsiveness when processing a large set of data records under node failures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:41","2025-11-10 09:29:41","","55-70","","1","21","","Tsinghua Sci.

As one of the popular information sharing manners on clouds, Online Self-Diagnosis (OSD) has been widely implemented for recommending medicines or treatment plans in the varied medical fields. However, there is a great risk for users when executing OSD since lack of professional pharmacological knowledge. This paper concentrates on this issue and proposes an ontology-based approach representing the medical knowledge for alarming potential risks. The proposed mechanism is named Secure Ontology-based Self-diagnosis (SOS) Model that is designed to generate knowledge of medical treatments or incompatibility of medicines to avoid improper behaviors of diagnoses.

Access Control is one of the traditional and essential security tools of data protection. The decision to grant access to a resource must ensure secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In particular, the challenge is more important with public clouds as many governing authorities could be involved in one cloud scenario. This implies a difficulty to work out which regulation should be applicable in case of conflict. In recent years, many access control models were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their security policies specification and enforcement. In this paper, we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies for the context of public cloud. Throughout the use of ontology tools, we propose an approach for checking privacy enforcement with access control conditions.

One of the major benefits of using EHR systems is assisting physicians to gain patients' healthcare information and shorten the process of the medical decision making. However, physicians' inputs still have a great impact on making decisions that cannot be checked by EHR systems. This consequence can be influenced by human behaviors or physicians' knowledge structures. An efficient approach of alerting to the unusual decisions is an urgent requirement for current EHR systems. This paper proposes a schema using ontology in big data to generate an alerting mechanism to assist physicians to make a proper medical diagnosis. The proposed model is Ontology-based EHR Error Prevention Model (OEHR-EPM), which is implemented by a proposed algorithm, Error Prevention Adjustment Algorithm (EPAA). The ontological approach uses Protege to represent the knowledge-based ontology. The proposed schema has been examined by our experiments and the experimental results show that our schema has a higher-level accuracy rate and acceptable operating time performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:43","2025-11-10 09:29:43","","752-757","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

In cloud computing, the unique characteristics in cloud services such as dynamic and diverse services offered at different levels, together with the lack of standardized description languages pose significant challenges for effective cloud service discovery. In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service categories to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching in real environments. Our approach has the capability to automatically identify and categorize cloud services by detecting cloud service concepts from cloud service sources. Initially, we focus on building the cloud service ontology by using NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology). Then, we utilize our cloud service categorization method to investigate cloud service ontology's concepts in a real-world cloud services dataset which contains the metadata of 5,883 real cloud services. After that, we generate cloud service clusters by using cosine similarity to build the cloud service categorization. Our cloud service categorization is helpful in determining whether a given web source is a cloud service. Furthermore, the new web resource which has been categorized as a cloud service can be used to boost knowledge of cloud service categorization cumulatively. The proposed approach is validated by using real-world cloud services available on the World Wide Web and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in cloud service discovery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:43","2025-11-10 09:29:43","","151-158","","","2015-November","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc IEE Int.

However, many cloud computing providers offer their cloud resources according to their own rules. The descriptions of various cloud resources also differ for each vendor. Subsequently, it becomes difficult to find suitable cloud resources given the characteristics of an application. Scientists therefore, select resources used in previous experiments or best performance resources without considering the characteristics of their applications. There is the need to standardize notations to support simple selection of cloud resources without the constraints of providers. Intercloud can use cloud resources without considering cloud providers in hybrid cloud environments. Intercloud project has been studied for interoperability and creates mOSAIC ontology to conceptualize various resources. However, the mOSAIC ontology attributes are limited when considering characteristics of an application. We propose a semantic engine to provide semantic cloud resource services in intercloud environment. We define a rule of categorized resource description with reference to mOSAIC ontology attributes which includes added factors needed to represent application characteristics. We also develop a semantic engine which can choose semantically similar cloud resources using statistical analysis while considering the characteristics of an application.

Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:43","2025-11-10 09:29:43","","1081-1084","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

BPaaS providers may look for available business processes from other cloud providers to improve their processes. However, today's BPaaS solutions lack an explicit and formal semantics which prevent an easy and dynamic interoperability between different cloud providers. In this paper, we propose firstly to semantically populate a shared knowledge base of process models deployed by BPaaS providers. Therefore, using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve similar process fragments that can be used to design new process variants. We also performed experiments on large public datasets and experimental results show that our approach is feasible and efficient. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:43","2025-11-10 09:29:43","","712-719","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

Despite agreement on that the transformation of business model is importance to an organization's success, the evolution of business model enabled by Cloud is still fuzzy and vague within many research fields including both Management Strategy Theory and Information Systems. This paper, following a review of existing works and a series of case studies from several typical industries, employs a deductive reasoning method to investigate the influence of cloud computing on business model evolution and presents a specific service-centric business model. First, the evolution of business model in cloud environment is developed. Second, by analyzing business model innovations on business model nine building blocks in cloud environment, the element of service-centric business model is defined. Then, an ontological framework which includes value, service, and business model dimension for service-centric innovative business model is proposed.

During the years Cloud systems became more and more complex. The main idea is that all Cloud components offer their functions as a service. For this reason Cloud systems inherits many features from old Web Services and Service Oriented architectures. At the moment, the need for composition and automation of Cloud services is a hot research field. Orchestration is one of the topics that researchers are investigating. Unlike web services, it is not clear what orchestration means in Cloud Systems. It usually addresses automation, but no clear definitions and languages have been provided. Another hot topic regarding composition of cloud services is the definition of design, architectural and communication Patterns for solving well known and common problems. In this work we will show how Orchestration and some Patterns are tightly coupled. We will describe a methodology for definition of orchestrated workflows which exploits some common Cloud Design Patterns in order to verify composition soundness. In addition we will show how this methodology can be used to verify some requirements on the composed Cloud services.

In the field of advanced manufacturing however, the impact has been significantly lesser than expected due to limitations in cloud platforms for fostering community engagement. To address this problem, we study a new cloud-based architecture that provides Platform-asa-Service (PaaS) management capabilities to the manufacturing community for delivering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) 'Apps' to their customers. Our architecture aims at supporting an 'App Marketplace' that thrives on agile development, organic collaboration and scalable sales of next generation manufacturing Apps requiring high-performance simulation and modeling. Towards realizing the vision of the above architecture, our paper involves investigation and implementation of an Ontology Service that interoperates with other common web services related to resource brokering and accounting. Our Ontology Service uses principles of mapping and merging to translate a manufacturing App's collaboration requirements to suitable resource specifications on public cloud platforms. Integrated resultant ontology can be queried to provision the required resource parameters such as amount of memory/storage, number of processing units, and network protocol configurations needed for deployment of an App. We validate the effectiveness of our Ontology Service using the Protégé framework in a pilot testbed of a real-world 'WheelSim' App in the NSF GENI Cloud platform.

The proposed eHeaRSS is like a family doctor to care patients, especially to use generated patients-context. eHeaRSS is a recommendation system for immediate and appropriate medical services using crowd sourcing in cloud computing environment. To do this, it is necessary to classify the data into symptoms, diseases, departments and doctors related data types. To consider hierarchies or subsume relationships among them, eHeaRSS Ontology (eHeaRSS-Ont) is developed through integration of 4-static ontology (4-Ont) which is comprised of symptom-, disease-, department-and doctor-Ont to create tailored recommendations depending on patient-context. For the recommendation service, Case-based reasoning (CBR) is applied. The extracted cases using 4-Ont are integrated by eHeaRSS-Ont depending on the patient-context. For customization, it is necessary to reconfigure the case using eHeaRSS Constraints Value Compatibility Map (eHeaRSS-CVCM). To prove the significance and efficiency of the eHeaRSS, we experimented using ontology-based data processing and proved the superiority of eHeaRSS with the provision of better recommendation than other DB-based systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:45","2025-11-10 09:29:45","","1108-1113","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

In this paper, by exploiting the privacy medical queries, we propose a novel approach based on semantic and ontology to achieve the topic-level privacy preserving search.

The cloud user becomes willing to accept insecure conditions and unconsciously increases these conditions' security level if he is able to find a strategy that provides trust. This level of trust, once established, is difficult to maintain if any deception takes place. The indications of proven trust can only be seen in future usage of a cloud service. For this reason, specific control instruments are required to ascertain the accuracy of one's trust. The establishment of trust in a public cloud environment requires a paradigm change: a holistic strategy that enforces regulation requirements throughout the cloud architecture. The movement of the root of trust into hardware reduces vulnerability to compromise, as hardware attacks require a high expenditure of time and effort. Cloud users would define regulation standards through trust-worthy IT instruments and enforce them in specific cloud-service layers. The extension of this approach is the regulation of SaaS-based applications to enforce requirements for separation and availability. This work introduces a conceptual approach to establish a chain of policy by using hardware-oriented root of trust. The conceptual description of a chain of policy outlines the main principles to enforce regulations accurately for each architectural cloud layer based on an established chain of trust. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:45","2025-11-10 09:29:45","","601-606","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

It has constructed numerous domain-specific knowledge graphs related to merchants, companies, accounts, products, and more. AKGP manages trillions of structured knowledge graphs, serving search, recommendation, risk control and other businesses. However, as the demand increasing for various workloads such as graph pattern matching, graph representation learning, and cross-domain knowledge reuse, the existing warehouse systems based on relational DBMS or graph databases are unable to meet the requirements. To address these issues, we propose KGFabric, an industrial-scale knowledge graph management system built on the distributed file system (DFS). KGFabric offers a nearline knowledge storage engine that utilizes a Semantic-enhanced Programmable Graph (SPG) model, which is compatible with the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model. The data is persistently stored in DFS, such as HDFS, which leverages the POSIX file system API, making it suitable for deployment in multi-cloud environment at low cost. KGFabric provides a native graph-based and hybrid storage format that can serve as a shared backend for parallel graph computing systems, significantly accelerating the analysis of multi-workload. Additionally, KGFabric includes a graph fabric framework that minimizes data duplication and guarantees data security.KGFabric is able to manage Peta-scale data and has supported graph fabric and analysis with over 100 billion relations at Ant Group. We conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate the performance of KGFabric. Compared with popular relational DBMS and graph databases, the storage space for semantic relations is reduced by over 90%. The performance of graph fabric improves by 21× in real-world workloads. In multi-hop semantic graph analysis, KGFabric enhances performance by 100×.","2024-08","2025-11-10 09:33:00","2025-11-10 09:33:00","","3841–3854","","12","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: VLDB Endowment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only a knowledge representation format is insufficient and we need powerful response mechanisms to manage effectively global and distributed queries across a set of stand-alone and heterogeneous RDF resources marked by the dynamic and scalable nature of their content.","2018","2025-11-10 09:33:01","2025-11-10 09:33:01","","","","","","","","","SCA '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Tetouan, Morocco","","","","Cloud computing; big data; Semantic web; domain ontology; distributed request","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unregulated and rampant collection of user and usage data by applications led to concerns on privacy, trust, and ethics. This has resulted in several governments and organizations across geographies to frame laws on data (e.g., the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) that govern and define boundaries for the storage, processing and transitioning of data; and thereby safeguard the interests of its citizens. Data Sovereignty and Data Localization are two important aspects, which deal with the adherence to the laws and governance structures, that define where and how data is collected and processed. The applicability of different laws depends upon several attributes such as the nature, type, and purpose of data. Non-compliance to laws/regulations can lead to serious repercussions for enterprises, ranging from hefty penalties to loss of brand value. Ensuring that all of their applications are complaint to various laws and regulations is non-trivial. Enterprises have to deal with a plethora of laws (that are constantly evolving) and are often confused even in correctly identifying all the applicable laws for their context leave alone ensuring compliance to regulations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a knowledge graph based data sovereignty governance framework that assists in classifying data and in identifying the relevant applicable laws.","2020","2025-11-10 09:33:01","2025-11-10 09:33:01","","303–306","","","","","","","ICSEW'20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seoul, Republic of Korea","","","","Cloud Computing; Knowledge Graph; Classification; Data Sovereignty; Governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current MOOCs platforms encounter challenges in personalized learning due to disorganized resources, and the inability to capture dynamic learning demands. We present a dynamic scheduling system for multi-module cloud course resources using deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, a knowledge graph and conceptualization ability model are constructed to evaluate students' knowledge mastery levels. The dynamic demands are modeled as Markov Decision Processes, and optimized matching strategies are derived via deep Q-learning to satisfy personalized requirements. A reward function is designed to maximize students' knowledge conceptualization ability. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. This work provides a new intelligent solution to adaptively schedule cloud course resources. The core innovations lie in accurate dynamic modeling, and adaptive resource provisioning strategies for personalized learning.","2024","2025-11-10 09:33:01","2025-11-10 09:33:01","","1008–1012","","","","","","","ICIEAI '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Xiamen, China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advanced search engines are used to retrieve precise information out of these knowledge resources. The main challenge is not only retrieving data but also how to keep data safe and protected against any form of attacks.In this paper, we propose a security aware based model for semantic search engines. Our work aims to combine advances in information technology, such as cloud technology, while addressing security issues which threaten the integrity of information. In particular security gaps and countermeasures of the semantic web are identified. ISO/IEC security requirements for the protection of personally identifiable information (PII) are presented to cover security vulnerabilities of the proposed model. Finally, the feasibility of our proposed model is checked against the N2Sky use case, a multi-cloud knowledge information management system for the computational intelligence community.","2017","2025-11-10 09:33:01","2025-11-10 09:33:01","","198–207","","","","","","","iiWAS '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Salzburg, Austria","","","","semantic web; OWL; RDF; authorization; authentication; cryptography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data can be ingested directly from instruments or manually uploaded by users and then shared with remote collaborators using a web front end. We discuss some of the challenges encountered in designing and developing a system that can be easily adapted to different scientific areas including digital preservation, geoscience, material science, medicine, social science, cultural heritage and the arts. Some of these challenges include support for large amounts of data, horizontal scaling of domain specific preprocessing algorithms, ability to provide new data visualizations in the web browser, a comprehensive Web service API for automatic data ingestion and curation, a suite of social annotation and metadata management features to support data annotation by communities of users and algorithms, and a web based front-end to interact with code running on heterogeneous clusters, including HPC resources.","2018","2025-11-10 09:33:01","2025-11-10 09:33:01","","","","","","","","","PEARC '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, PA, USA","","","","data management; linked data; data curation; metadata management; scientific gateways","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
