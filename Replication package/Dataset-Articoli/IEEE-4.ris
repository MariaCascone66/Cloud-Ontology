AB  - The number of systems and applications where large groups of people are included into the information processing “loop” is growing. Common problem with this kind of systems is that each of them requires large number of contributors and collecting this number may take significant time and effort. This paper aims at development of an ontology-driven cloud platform that would support deployment of various human-based applications and therefore reuse the existing crowd. Three features that distinguish the proposed platform from similar developments are ontologies, digital contracts and resource monitoring facilities. Ontological mechanisms (ability to precisely define semantics and use inference to find related terms) are used to find and allocate human resources required by software services. Digital contracts are used to achieve predictability required by cloud users (application developers). Finally, explicit mechanisms for resource monitoring are essential, as human resources are always limited and the developers of applications deployed in the platform should be aware of particular limitations.

AB  - Security challenges are the most important obstacles for the advancement of IT-based on-demand services and cloud computing as an emerging technology. Lack of coincidence in identity management models based on defined policies and various security levels in different cloud servers is one of the most challenging issues in clouds. In this paper, a policy-based user authentication model has been presented to provide a reliable and scalable identity management and to map cloud users' access requests with defined polices of cloud servers. In the proposed schema several components are provided to define access policies by cloud servers, to apply policies based on a structural and reliable ontology, to manage user identities and to semantically map access requests by cloud users with defined polices. Finally, the reliability and efficiency of this policy-based authentication schema have been evaluated by scientific performance, security and competitive analysis. Overall, the results show that this model has met defined demands of the research to enhance the reliability and efficiency of identity management in cloud computing environments.

AB  - The long awaited Cloud computing concept is a reality now due to the advancement and transformation of computer generations. However, security challenges are most important obstacles for the advancement of this emerging technology. Managing security policies based on capabilities of service provider and requirements of cloud customers is one of the potential issues due to the scalability and isolation concepts in clouds. In this paper, a multi-layered policy engine is presented to manage policies securely with the minimum consumption of processing power for enhancement of QoS in virtualized environments. Thus, a Policy Layer Constructor and Reasoning Engine are introduced to divide polices into several layers for enhancing quality and reliability of mapping access requests to cloud nodes. The suggested model has been evaluated with performance, security and competitive analysis, and the reliability and efficiency of multi-layered policy engine have been assured for defining, generating and applying security polices in clouds.

AB  - Despite the considerable benefits of cloud computing as an emerging technology, there are some reliability and privacy concerns such as generating and managing access policies according to sensitivity of stored data in cloud storages. The most challenging issue in current information policy models is managing security levels, mapping between access requests and defined policies and considering the flexibility and scalability of this management schema according to the characteristics of cloud computing models. Accordingly, an efficient token-based access model has been presented in this paper to provide a semantic mapping between access requests of cloud users and defined policies and sub-policies of cloud customers according to the authentication and access management protocols of protection ontology. Furthermore, a policy-based session token has been introduced to enhance the reliability of access, decrease the time of mapping by eliminating un-necessary mapping from checked policies and decrease data overhead of by classification of policies and sub-policies.

AB  - By embracing the cloud computing paradigm for storing and processing electronic medical records (EMRs), modern healthcare providers are able to realise significant cost savings. However, relinquishing control of sensitive medical data by delegating their storage and processing to third-party cloud providers naturally raises significant security concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise appropriate policies that infuse adequate access controls in cloud services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of these services, coupled with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinder the formulation of effective and interoperable policies that are appropriate for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work adopts the ontological templates proposed in [5] for the representation of access control policies in the medical sector. By capturing the knowledge that must be infused into an access control policy, these templates sufficiently address the needs of the underlying domain of application in which such a policy is to be enforced; at the same time, they facilitate developers in infusing adequate access controls to their cloud applications.

AB  - Manufacturing companies today instead of selling classical products turn more to offer Product Service Systems (PSS). The development of PSS in manufacturing industry requires intensive collaboration among various actors across the value chain. Innovative collaborative ICT environment including sets of advanced tools allowing for effective PSS development are needed. Enormous amount of knowledge to be gathered and shared under dynamically changing conditions, and diffused to a wide spectrum of actors involved, having different expertise and working conditions/cultures, asks for effective context sensitive solutions for knowledge capturing, analysis and diffusion. The paper presents a novel approach for context sensitivity of tools to support collaborative PSS development. The proposed solution is one of the first attempts to provide holistic methodology and set of software services allowing for context sensitivity of diverse PSS engineering tools. The context model based on ontology and the set of services for context monitoring and extraction are specified and developed. The application of the proposed solution in machine industry for collaborative PSS development is discussed.

AB  - During the lifecycle of automated production systems (aPS) additional functionalities and evolutions are realized. As a consequence, control software of aPS becomes highly complex and hard to maintain, which rises the need for evaluating and improving the quality of the control software. Tools for assessing and analyzing the quality of control software are rare and mostly lack accessible platforms that allow the use of analysis data by quality officers and stakeholders. Therefore, this paper presents a cloud platform for code-analysis, a developed tool for evaluating control software by means of Semantic Web technologies. The scalability of the cloud platform supports varied volumes of data and allows efficient use of the analysis data in a continuous integration system for trend analysis in combination with software quality model that can indicate the overall quality level of the control software.

AB  - This paper describes the development of an open-source information system, called Asclepios, which manages a plethora of information on communicable diseases in an agile manner. Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily. The application of Asclepios is wide ranging - from military to Government through to medical and tourism and pharmaceuticals. Further, Asclepios-like applications are very much needed in most Third world countries, including all countries in Africa, as it can significantly enhance the health, safety and well-being of people.

AB  - Smart factory addresses the vertical integration of physical entities and information systems. Network and cloud are two essential infrastructures to achieve this goal. Among them, the network provides interconnection for communication and data flow, while the cloud provides powerful and elastic computing and storage abilities for big data and intelligent applications. This paper presents a cloud-centric framework for the implementation of the smart factory. Based on this framework, three high leveled protocols viz., EtherCAT, DDS, and OPC UA are selected to implement machine network (controller to sensors/actuators communication), machine to machine communication, and machine to cloud communication respectively, to satisfy diverse communication requirements of the smart factory. An integrated architecture for combining ontology knowledge and semantic data to support intelligent applications is also proposed. These network and data process schemes are verified in a smart factory prototype for personalized candy packing application.

AB  - Service Level Agreement (SLA) is gaining more and more interest since the dynamic aspect of the cloud computing can adversely influence the guarantee of the Quality of Service (QoS). Proving an SLA violation is considered to be a complex operation to the cloud consumer. This task gets more and more difficult to the consumers as they use services from multiple providers, each with its own monitoring policies. In order to implicitly help the consumer monitor the SLA and detect violations, it is necessary to implement some advanced SLA management strategies. Ontological representation and reasoning techniques in SLA management may be beneficial to the evaluation of the QoS. In this regard, we propose a monitoring approach with a new semantic SLA modeling for cloud computing. Our approach aims to help cloud consumers monitor the SLA documents and detect violations by considering the semantic meaning of SLA concepts and taking profit from the power of reasoning techniques. This maintains a reliable QoS and respects the SLA parameters. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in this paper through a simulation and a case study.

In this paper, we introduce a service oriented solution to assist OER providers and instructors to deal with the sparsity of data in OER recommendation using an ontological approach. Learners' features are predicted by spreading activation and demographic similarity based inference. An evolutionary algorithm is provided to realize the OER recommendation in terms of heuristic rules.

AB  - Platform as a Service is the major productivity enabler in the cloud computing stack. By providing managed and highly automated application environments, it enhances developer productivity and reduces developer operations and maintenance efforts. The market, however, is fast-changing and offerings are differing conceptually as well as in their supported technological ecosystem. Therefore, provider selection is an important but currently not well supported step for companies trying to benefit from the technology. Influenced by the diversity of service offerings and the absence of applied standards this is a tedious task, especially for ensuring application portability. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria selection approach for cloud platforms based on a field-tested ontology and a comprehensive data set. The methodology is enhanced by semantic algorithms and mappings to reduce hidden query and data biases. This allows not only the exact matching of requirements but also the evaluation of possible alternatives that can be adapted to fit the defined requirements. We validate our approach by contrasting real user queries against the results of our semantically enhanced algorithms.

AB  - One of the key challenges faced by consumers is to efficiently manage and monitor the quality of cloud services. To manage service performance, consumers have to validate rules embedded in cloud legal contracts, such as Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Privacy Policies, that are available as text documents. Currently this analysis requires significant time and manual labor and is thus inefficient. We propose a cognitive assistant that can be used to manage cloud legal documents by automatically extracting knowledge (terms, rules, constraints) from them and reasoning over it to validate service performance. In this paper, we present this Question and Answering (Q&A) system that can be used to analyze and obtain information from the SLA documents. We have created a knowledgebase of Cloud SLAs from various providers which forms the underlying repository of our Q&A system. We utilized techniques from natural language processing and semantic web (RDF, SPARQL and Fuseki server) to build our framework. We also present sample queries on how a consumer can compute metrics such as service credit.

AB  - Securing their critical documents on the cloud from data threats is a major challenge faced by organizations today. Controlling and limiting access to such documents requires a robust and trustworthy access control mechanism. In this paper, we propose a semantically rich access control system that employs an access broker module to evaluate access decisions based on rules generated using the organizations confidentiality policies. The proposed system analyzes the multi-valued attributes of the user making the request and the requested document that is stored on a cloud service platform, before making an access decision. Furthermore, our system guarantees an end-to-end oblivious data transaction between the organization and the cloud service provider using oblivious storage techniques. Thus, an organization can use our system to secure their documents as well as obscure their access pattern details from an untrusted cloud service provider.

AB  - In this paper, we present an approach to adapt the e-assessment workflow by considering learner's profiles. We have started by creating a learner profile ontology based on extraction data from e-assessment activities, file log and personal information. Then, we have defined three adaptation actions: Add Activity, Edit Activity and Delete Activity, applied on the workflow assessment and using information extracted from learner profile ontology instances. Each action is applied according to conditions. After that, we present some results of the empirical evaluation of our system.

AB  - While the potential benefits of the Friend of a Friend (FOAF) vocabulary within the context of facilitating Social Networking Site (SNS) user profile portability have been broadly discussed, the potential benefits for users with visual impairments have been overlooked. Previous studies have identified SNSs categorically as presenting a number of unique usability challenges for users with visual impairments, a contentions supported by our ethnographic study of Facebook involving blind participants and the JAWS screen reader. Participants were most severely challenged by the process of creating and modifying user profile information and identifying other users with whom to establish relationships. The ability to decouple these activities from any single SNS using a FOAFbased cloud system may enable users to perform these activities in a more screen reader compatible (e.g. JAWS, NVDA) environment. In this paper we propose a portable profile cloud architecture based on the FOAF vocabulary and discuss the implementation of this architecture using several services of the Windows Azure cloud ecosystem. This system, as implemented, enables users to create multiple, parallel SNS-agnostic user profiles. As the system is currently constituted, these profiles can be generated with new data or information retrieved from an existing Facebook user profile. This modifiable profile and relationship information is then exported to Azure BLOB storage as an RDF file that may be accessed via a URL and may be used with any compatible system.

AB  - The considerable increase in the use of cloud computing and big data solutions requires the use of advanced technologies to ensure data security, privacy and dependability. One of the possible solutions is the use of data anonymization techniques, which performs an important role in data privacy protection. There are several techniques and algorithms to implement data anonymization. However, specifications and guidelines to guide and standardize the use of these resources are needed. These guidelines, called anonymization policies, are considered an important asset in organizations that want to protect their customer personal data. Although the use of data anonymization brings great benefits, there are no clear directions for data anonymization policies, which ends up limiting its adoption by companies and organizations. This work presents a generic anonymization policy to be used in cloud and big data platforms. It also presents a draft ontology with explicit formal specifications for data anonymization policies. This ontology has three main intentions: (i) to standardize the use of data anonymization policies; (ii) share common understanding of the structure of data anonymization among people; (iii) enable reuse of data anonymization policies. In this work, an ongoing study case within the EUBra-BIGSEA project will be implemented.

This study is to investigate how different kinds of internet resources can be located on the Internet for sharing among robots. It focuses on the sharing of robot services created by different developers and the building of a more complete environment map from the partial maps constructed by different robots. To verify our work, we perform a set of experiments and the results show the promise of the presented approach.

AB  - The success of big data projects depends heavily on the ability to decide which technological expertise and architectures are required in such a context. However, there is confusion in scientific discourse regarding the systemization of big data technologies which exacerbates this problem. Therefore, in this paper, a structured literature review is conducted to assess the current state of the art and give an overview about big data technology classifications. It can be stated that only very limited approaches for classifications exist, which are partially incomplete or address only single aspects of big data technologies, such as the used database type. Conducting this literature review, investigations have also been made to derive possible starting points for extending existing or developing new classification approaches, which can form the basis of a future big data classification framework. Such a concept could be used to improve the decision-support for planning and managing big data projects. However, a common understanding would require unambiguous definitions of the term technology and various other expressions, which are used in the literature as a synonym today.

AB  - Security and privacy challenges are the most important obstacles for the advancement of IT-based on-demand services and cloud computing as an emerging technology. To ensure data confidentiality and fine-grained access control in cloud-based environments, stored data and resources needs to be re-encrypted periodically or based on special mechanisms such as revoked user-based or manual re-encryption. Managing the process of re-encryption is a challenging issue that involves many limitations such as time management, resource confidentiality, and level of access. Accordingly, a multi-level re-encryption model based on policy management has been presented in this paper to ensure data security in clouds. The proposed model uses a policy-based ontology to generate, manage and apply re-encryption policies based on the characteristics of resources, sensitivity of data and capabilities of service provider. The results of comprehensive performance and security analysis of proposed model shows this model increases the reliability of re-encryption processes in cloud storages considerably and provides an efficient policy management for re-encryption tasks.

AB  - Cloud computing represents a new computing approach that allows creating robust and on-demand services controlled by means of Service Level Agreements (SLA). These documents are generated following a process of negotiation during which the client chooses a subset of clauses among choices predefined by the provider on a "take it or leave it" basis. However, the heterogeneity between client requests and provider offers may result in inappropriate SLA. In addition, the cloud service context may change over the time which causes a client requirements adjustment and therefore, the SLA remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cloud SLA negotiation and re-negotiation approach that integrate a semantic mapping between client requests and provider offers with the aim of generating a suitable SLA document. Moreover, our approach includes a context-aware system to adapt the SLA throughout reasoning techniques and automatically ensure the re-negotiation. A prototype implementation demonstrates the feasibility and the efficiency of our approach.

This approach allows the data owner (tenant and/or end users) to define his privacy requirements and to include regulations policy based on a privacy ontology model that captures all privacy concepts related to the data access and usage in the cloud. The PriArmor approach allows the enforcement of usage control requirements at a low level using a System Call Interception (SCI) technique that enables detecting the intention for policy breaching and inhibiting it. Moreover, the PriArmor approach introduces a data flow model that tracks private data and reflects the existence of derived data through the system to maintain a strong enforcement level. The performed evaluation proves the efficiency of our approach for ensuring policy enforcement in the cloud environment.

The pregnant women are monitored by physicians benefiting their experience in last months of pregnancy to predict certain risks in premature birth. The paper presents a solution to prevent high risk situations, using ontology as support in profiling pregnant women with possible pregnancy risks. Based on ontology and available medical database of one of the largest maternity hospitals in Timisoara (Bega) we create profiles of women focusing on cases with problems and high potential risks, using as tool the open source Protégé for ontology and Visual Studio .Net for the supporting application. The ontology creates links between the characteristics of pregnant women, medical history, disease and possible problems that may occur during pregnancy. The ontology is used in an application stored in cloud to be accessed by physicians from different locations. Based on this information the application creates women profiles matching the risk they may be exposed to. The application is in tests in Bega Hospital. A set of profiles resulting from a knowledge base will show high risk situations, mainly in premature birth cases.

DMS and eSignature requirements and legislation (like MoReq and eIDAS) influenced record management practice. PAIS, OAIS and storage solutions have their impact on the archival management. Special audio and video format solutions influenced specialised archives. Graph databases as a more agile tool for organising information and the upcoming Records in Contexts (RiC) standard are influencing archival description. New preservation methods have emerged - Chain of Preservation model (COP) and the upcoming Preservation-as-a-Service for Trust (PaasT) model. PaasT is the result of growing cloud services. Semantic web influenced retrieval and usage of materials in all heritage institutions. The authors proceed to discuss how the elaborated changes should reflect the archival science academic curricula. They investigate what are new archival science core competences that should be taught to students and archival professionals by university teachers today, how should universities prepare their students of archival science for contemporary (digital) labour market etc. The authors offer a clear position what archival competencies, arising from the influence of ICT and cloud environment, should be built upon in the contemporary archival science curricula.

AB  - In recent years, cloud-assisted body area network (CABAN) technologies have made their entrance in the Smart healthcare field, such as Smart home environment, and play a significant role for healthcare data storage, processing, and efficient decision making. However, currently, the CABAN paradigm in the healthcare domain is facing increasing difficulty in handling the huge amount of sensor data that the body sensor devices generate from diverse Smart home applications. Therefore, the challenging is now timely storing, processing, and analyzing of the sensor data in real time to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the caregivers or Smart home applications. QoS, here, is the capacity to support diverse Smart home applications in healthcare with different priorities, performance, and resource requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast and robust cloud resource allocation model for body sensor devices to ensure QoS for Smart home healthcare applications. We develop the proposed resource allocation algorithm using agent-based modeling (ABM) and ontology. There are few works, which consider ABM and ontology for resource allocation in CABAN platform. Moreover, we used an ABM tool called NetLogo to implement the proposed resource allocation model. The results from the implementation were compared with the results of existing algorithms and found to be promising.

AB  - The recent growth of popularity of cloud computing services delivers various benefits in multiple fields of activity, including reduced resource costs due to optimized hardware setup, as well as improving mobility. However, cloud computing has some issues that need to be clarified, one of which is the security of cloud computing. The dispersion of cloud service vendors means that most security issues are still addressed often as unique to the particular vendor or cloud computing system, lacking standardization of the procedures and protocols that users and vendors follow when implementing a cloud computing system and running it. This paper deals with cloud computing security management. It offers an ontology, designed by the authors of the paper, specifically built to deal with cloud security controls covering the most important documents of the domain of cloud security management and the implementation of the proposed ontology to an enterprise architecture modeling language.

While one cloud provider is good at one or a few services, other providers might be good at other services. Cloud users eventually want to consume most advantageous resources across multiple providers with the best price while avoiding vendor lock-in. Cloud users also need to safeguard their most valuable digital asset, their data, against cloud outage, which can happen to any vendor. This could mean using the same type of resources across multiple cloud providers. Moreover, cloud providers are continuously changing and evolving their services. Cloud users can only take advantage of these changes if they are able to relocate and real-locate resources using an autonomous and vendor independent tool. We propose a vendor-independent cloud provisioning tool that utilizes an ontology-based semantic reasoning to acquire the best feasible cloud resources for cloud users. In this paper, we outline an ontology subset for purchasing cloud resources or services based on price, user transaction volume, preference, quality of service and Service Layer Agreements (SLA). The proposed ontology is outlined in a case scenario followed by an applied algorithm for negotiating resource purchase between cloud consumer client and cloud vendor provisioning services. Such ontology can be used in inter-cloud federation API for monitoring and acquiring and maintaining the most advantageous cloud resources.

AB  - The High-Performance Computing (HPC) users require the high-end compute, storage, and, network execution environment in a dynamic manner for testing HPC applications. The High-Performance Computing Cloud (HPCC) provides a kind of execution environment in an on-demand manner. Generally, the cloud resource management system or cloud resource broker manages the compute, storage, and network resources in HPCC. However, it faces the challenges of scalability, interoperability, and achieving guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). Hence, the proposed research work addresses the above-said issues by employing the distributed cloud resource management framework. The proposed system can be able to handle a large number of user application requests and manage the multiple cloud resources in an interoperable manner. The proposed system is evaluated by submitting a large number of real-world HPC applications. The performance metrics such as response time, a number of successfully handled requests, and user satisfaction are measured to evaluate the performance of proposed system.

AB  - As a new software paradigm, cloud computing provides services dynamically according to user requirements. However, it tends to disclose personal information due to collaborative computing and transparent interactions among software as a service (SaaS) services. We propose a private data disclosure checking method that can be applied to the collaboration interaction process. First, we describe the privacy requirement with ontology and description logic. Second, with dynamic description logic, we validate whether SaaS services are authorized to obtain a user's privacy attributes, to prevent unauthorized services from obtaining their private data. Third, we monitor authorized SaaS services to guarantee privacy requirements. Therefore, we can prevent users' private data from being used and propagated illegally. Finally, we propose privacy disclosure checking algorithms, and demonstrate their correctness and feasibility by experiments.

AB  - Most curricula in Informatics and other sciences at the universities are in permanent change. An informatics foresight is useful to update the study programs and to develop and offer new study curricula tuned for the local needs. More of these types of studies are developed by governmental departments and specialized groups because of the number of variables to analyse, the complexity of scenarios, and the wide number of experts needed, not to mention the cost and the governmental plans and goals a country has. In this paper we have adapted a simple method to define an informatics foresight using the information already available in internet and specialized electronic libraries. The method was applied to a study case: the future of the informatics and computer science majors at Escuela Politécnica Nacional of Quito Ecuador.

AB  - The Linked Data paradigm is a common standard initiated to complement the general architecture of the semantic web and create a single space containing data that is machine-readable and connected to related data. Figures, however, show that one of the main sources of semi-structured data providers, Web APIs, continued to grow even after the creation of the Linked Data concept. Given that data sources with significant value are still in a semi-structured format, it is essential to bridge between the two data models, so that the full potential of the semantic web can be realised. This paper presents SimiMatch, an approach for schema matching between semi-structured and Linked Data. It contributes towards a virtual integration system that will be able to provide transparent access to heterogeneous and autonomous sources. It addresses the challenge of sustaining the continuous changes of the web of data via semantic similarity measurement.

AB  - Network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) have been proposed to increase the cost-efficiency, flexibility, and innovation in network service provisioning. This is achieved by leveraging IT virtualization techniques and combining them with programmable networks. By doing so, NFV and SDN are able to decouple the network functionality from the physical devices on which they are deployed. Service function chains (SFCs) composed out of virtual network functions (VNFs) can now be deployed on top of the virtualized infrastructure to create new value-added services. Current NFV approaches are limited to mapping the different VNF to the physical substrate subject to resource capacity constraints. They do not provide the possibility to define location requirements with a certain granularity and constraints on the colocation of VNF and virtual edges. Nevertheless, many scenarios can be envisioned in which a service provider (SP) would like to attach placement constraints for efficiency, resilience, legislative, privacy, and economic reasons. Therefore, we propose a set of affinity and anti-affinity constraints, which can be used by SP to define such placement restrictions. Furthermore, a semantic SFC validation framework is proposed that allows the virtual network function infrastructure provider (VNFInP) to check the validity of a set of constraints and provide feedback to the SPs. This allows the VNFInP to filter out any non-valid SFC requests before sending them to the mapping algorithm, significantly reducing the mapping time.

AB  - A secured “co-operative cloud computing utility”, is a shared set of unique and virtually interconnected system assets. These, computing services, are accessed globally using thin clients and handheld devices through standard collective GUI, anytime, at any location upon payment of specified usage charges. This multi-ally computing utility perks up the advanced facilities to the existing assets. The security and privacy controlling of this utility (data centers, and data storage) is uniformly, vested with service patrons and suppliers, both stakeholders with shared responsibility of security implementation using multilateral relationship among them. In this paper, we propose the ontology of this vicinity, which demonstrates an interrelated layered architecture for a secured co-operative galactic computing utility. This computing architecture is proposed empirically based on our understanding and survey with various industry/academic professionals. We tried to understand the challenges they faced while using the cloud system. So, we conceptually propose this ally architecture which consists of multi-layer with multi-lateral co-operative multi-factor balanced security framework with common business interests along with shared responsibility among the stakeholders. Also we try to prove empirically multilateral balanced security which in-turn increases the strong defense measures among the multi-laterally allied bunch of users.

AB  - Nowadays, service trading over the Web is gaining momentum. In this highly dynamic scenario, both providers and consumers need to formalize their contractual and legal relationship, creating service level agreements. Although there exist some proposals that provide models to describe that relationship, they usually only cover technical aspects, not providing explicit semantics to the agreement terms. Furthermore, these models cannot be effectively shared on the Web, since they do not actually follow Web principles. These drawbacks hamper take-up and automatic analysis. In this article, we introduce Linked USDL Agreement, a semantic model to specify, manage and share service level agreement descriptions on the Web. This model is part of the Linked USDL family of ontologies that can describe not only technical but also business related aspects of services, incorporating Web principles. We validate our proposal by describing agreements in computational and non-computational scenarios, namely cloud computing and business process outsourcing services. Moreover, we evaluate the actual coverage and expressiveness of Linked USDL Agreement comparing it with existing models. In order to foster its adoption and effectively manage the service level agreement lifecycle, we present an implemented tool that supports creation, automatic analysis, and publication on the Web of agreement descriptions.

AB  - Most current security solutions are based on perimeter security. However, Cloud computing breaks the organization perimeters. When data resides in the Cloud, they reside outside the organizational bounds. This leads users to a loos of control over their data and raises reasonable security concerns that slow down the adoption of Cloud computing. Is the Cloud service provider accessing the data? Is it legitimately applying the access control policy defined by the user? This paper presents a data-centric access control solution with enriched role-based expressiveness in which security is focused on protecting user data regardless the Cloud service provider that holds it. Novel identity-based and proxy re-encryption techniques are used to protect the authorization model. Data is encrypted and authorization rules are cryptographically protected to preserve user data against the service provider access or misbehavior. The authorization model provides high expressiveness with role hierarchy and resource hierarchy support. The solution takes advantage of the logic formalism provided by Semantic Web technologies, which enables advanced rule management like semantic conflict detection. A proof of concept implementation has been developed and a working prototypical deployment of the proposal has been integrated within Google services.

AB  - In a business cloud environment, a reference business process model needs to be customized in order to meet the individualized requirements of each organization. Consequently, a reference process model is generally evolved to a couple of process variants, known as a process family. Currently, there exist some approaches and tools that can efficiently configure a reference process model. However, a key issue is how to manage co-evolution appropriately within a family of process models if the base process model of a process family is changed. Contemporary process management tools do not adequately support the management of such co-evolution. Each process variant in the process family has to be changed as a separate process model which often leads to redundancies and inefficiencies. In this article, we propose a novel approach for managing co-evolution of process families based on an aspect-oriented approach. Change options on base process model are abstracted and extracted as a pluggable component, which can be selectively reused for all members, and consequently, guides the co-evolution for the whole process family. In particular, the control-flow and data-flow relations between process extension and a member of process families can be built by leveraging process extensibility patterns. The correctness of our extension approach is proved based on graph theory. The whole approach in this article have been implemented as a working open-source prototype and tested against a real case study from the city logistic distribution domain as well as real data set from SAP reference models.

AB  - The emergence of cloud computing infrastructure and Semantic Web technologies has created unprecedented opportunities for composing large-scale business processes and workflow-based applications that span multiple organizational domains. A key challenge related to composition of such multi-organizational business processes and workflows is posed by the security and access control policies of the underlying organizational domains. In this paper, we propose a framework for verifying secure composability of distributed workflows in an autonomous multi-domain environment. The objective of workflow composability verification is to ensure that all the users or processes executing the designated workflow tasks conform to the time-dependent security policy specifications of all collaborating domains. A key aspect of such verification is to determine the time-dependent schedulability of distributed workflows, assumed to be invoked on a recurrent basis. We use a two-step approach for verifying secure workflow composability. In the first step, a distributed workflow is decomposed into domain-specific projected workflows and is verified for conformance with the respective domain's security and access control policy. In the second step, the cross-domain dependencies amongst the workflow tasks performed by different collaborating domains are verified.

AB  - During the past years the Cloud Computing offer has exponentially grown, with new Cloud providers, platforms and services being introduced in the IT market. The extreme variety of services, often providing non uniform and incompatible interfaces, makes it hard for customers to decide how to develop, or even worse to migrate, their own application into the Cloud. This situation can only get worse when customers want to exploit services from different providers, because of the portability and interoperability issues that often arise. In this paper we propose a uniform, integrated, machine-readable, semantic representation of cloud services, patterns, appliances and their compositions. Our approach aims at supporting the development of new applications for the Cloud environment, using semantic models and automatic reasoning to enhance potability and interoperability when multiple platforms are involved. In particular, the proposed reasoning procedure allows to: perform automatic discovery of Cloud services and Appliances; map between agnostic and vendor dependent Cloud Patterns and Services; automatically enrich the semantic knowledge base.

AB  - Among the various applications of high performance computing, security of cloud computing is very essential and greater awareness in India. Security issues in cloud are very challenging, as the data are roaming without any control. The need to keep the security as well as privacy of the information in the cloud becomes a critical issue. On the basis of cloud architectures we can specify the security rules for the web application attacks. In this paper we go through study, design and purpose of ontology containing encryption algorithms. Here ontology describes the security rule specification. Encryption algorithm describes comparision of performance among different algorithms. The main focus of this kind of work is to present a study of cloud security policy using some encryption algorithm based on ontology. This study will follow the ontology framework build for security policy rules. This paper also discusses cloud based web services attacks, design of semantic rules, and detection of malicious traffic over internet as well as tools for handling ontology.

AB  - A cloud service selection model of the cloud service management system was proposed based on dynamic trustworthiness in order to select a trusted service which satisfies user's request from a lot of services with similar or same functions. A service selection algorithm was proposed in order to select the closest classification for the user's requester. A trust evaluation mechanism was introduced, combined with direct trust and domain recommended trust. Then a service resource was selected among the requester's classification, which is trusted. When the transaction was completed, the service satisfaction was evaluated and the trust degree was updated. Simulation results show that the model can improve the service requesters' satisfaction and has certain resilience to intentional noncooperation.

AB  - Nowadays, cloud computing is an emerging technology thanks to its ability to provide on-demand computing services (hardware and software) with less description standardization effort. Multiple issues and challenges in discovering cloud services appear due to the lack of the cloud service description standardization. In fact, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services while proposing ontologies. However, since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology (CSO), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. This paper contribution is threefold. First, it specifies a set of patterns and anti-patterns in order to evaluate CSO. Second, it defines an anti-pattern detection method based on SPARQL queries which provides a set of correction recommendations to help ontologists revise the ontology. Finally, some experiment tests were conducted in relation to: (i) the method efficiency and (ii) anti-pattern detection of design anomalies as well as taxonomic and domain errors within CSO.

AB  - In cloud manufacturing, manufacturing resources are services that can be looked up and accessed over the Internet. Manufacturing ontologies are used to store the service information. Manufacturers use service rules to control the access to their resources. The rules are normally written in natural language. Thus, they need to be converted to semantic rules that can be understood by the search engine of the manufacturing ontologies. Our previous work investigated converting service rules to semantic rules automatically. However, the scheme is not flexible enough. This paper proposed an improvement to the scheme in our previous work. The proposed scheme allows a wider range of service rules to be converted to semantic rules accurately.

Big Data in organizations have transformed the way organizations across industries implement new approach to handle huge amount of data. Organizations rely to this data to achieve specific business priorities. The challenge is how to capture this data from different data sources. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework using an ontology to capture relevant information from different data sources. In order to achieve this aim, we review past literature related to the model based ontology that incorporate both internal data and external data sources. The results from the this paper will develop an incremental approach to extend the ontology with relevant external knowledge bases by clustering and annotating the external data to concepts and properties within the ontology.

AB  - Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. It is a simple key-based object store where each Amazon S3 object has data, a key, and metadata. Object key name identifies the object in a bucket uniquely. Object metadata is a set of name-value pairs that can be set at the time of uploading. This design enables S3 to provide excellent performance for storing and retrieving objects based on a known key. However there are certain challenges which limits the use of the Object metadata efficiently due to non-standard metadata keys. On the other hand, ontology has been used to represent information in various domains. The use of ontology to model the information coming from heterogeneous sources results in non-ambiguous and a standard representation. Additionally, with an ontology based metadata the underlying metadata keys have the same shared semantic meaning. Thus ontology representation of S3 objects makes searching of objects using required attributes faster and efficient. This paper presents an ontology so that the metadata for all S3 objects have a common standard and same shared semantic meaning.

AB  - As a new service-oriented manufacturing paradigm, cloud manufacturing has experienced rapid development in the last few years. It is changing the way manufacturing enterprises organize production activities in that tangible and intangible manufacturing resources encapsulated as virtualized cloud services are provided to customers. However, customers do not know the details of manufacturing service and their demands are different. Thus, an On-demand Service mode is put forwards to simplify and improve the matching process between manufacturing services and customers' requirements. The manufacturing task ontology and the corresponding cloud service ontology are designed. Then based on the similarity matching algorithm of category information, word information, number information and normalization processing, a multi-level intelligent matching method is proposed in order to find appropriate services to meet users' demand. Finally, the conclusion is pointed out.

AB  - Today, cloud vendors host third party black-box services, whose developers usually provide only textual descriptions or purely syntactical interface specifications. Cloud vendors that give substantial support to other third party developers to integrate hosted services into new software solutions would have a unique selling feature over their competitors. However, to reliably determine if a service is reusable, comprehensive service specifications are needed. Characteristic for comprehensive in contrast to syntactical specifications are the formalization of ontological and behavioral semantics, homogeneity according to a global ontology, and a service grounding that links the abstract service description and its technical realization. Homogeneous, semantical specifications enable to reliably identify reusable services, whereas the service grounding is needed for the technical service integration. In general, comprehensive specifications are not available and have to be derived. Existing automatized approaches are restricted to certain characteristics of comprehensiveness. In my PhD, I consider an automatized approach to derive fully-fledged comprehensive specifications for black-box services. Ontological semantics are derived from syntactical interface specifications. Behavioral semantics are mined from call logs that cloud vendors create to monitor the hosted services. The specifications are harmonized over a global ontology. The service grounding is established using traceability information. The approach enables third party developers to compose services into complex systems and creates new sales channels for cloud and service providers.

Business Process as a Service provides the end-to-end cloud support for business processes instead of single applications. A graphical modelling environment allows non-technical modelers to design business processes and to specify requirements in human-interpretable way. Via semantic lifting, the graphical models can be annotated with classes and values from an enterprise ontology. The BPaaS Ontology contains the relevant classes for the smart Business and IT-Cloud alignment. It supports the modeler in using a standard terminology and thus ensures consistent modeling.

Process of situation awareness consists of (1) Perception to obtain necessary information (2) Comprehension of situation to identify facts for capturing situation (3) Projection to infer proper reaction to the situation. The task for the step 1 is to model the data to extract information while the step 2 and 3 are to infer new facts or rules from the existing facts or rules based on the information. By explosive increase of data from several environmental domains, new information can be obtained based on Big Data infrastructure. The new information contributes to improving computational situation awareness. In this research, an entire automating sequence to obtain information from the Big Data is presented. Obtaining information can be done by repetitive process of data analysis, which can be accomplished through standardized analysis process and automating algorithm using automatic service composition principle.

AB  - E-Science is inherently a collaborative activity, which enables users from different institutions to share computational resources for analysing data. These rerources are provided by different distributed systems, e.g. Clouds, Grids, local Clusters. These can have different access and accounting mechanisms and the providers may have no direct connection to the institutions involved in the collaboration. We address the problem of how e-Science collaborations can manage access to such resources within the collaboration in a fair and accountable way. This requires accountable matchmaking on a fine grained level (e.g. per user request). This is enabled by a standard-based ontology in our work that extends models widely used for resource matching but provides extra functionality in the accounting domain.

AB  - The recent rapid growth in Internet speeds and file storage requirements has made cloud storage an appealing option on both a personal and enterprise level. Despite the many benefits offered by cloud storage, many potential users with sensitive data refrain from fully utilizing this service due to valid concerns about information privacy. An established solution to this concern is to perform encryption on the user side with the key stored on a local machine, meaning the cloud will never see the user's plaintext data. However, by encrypting data on the user side data processing capabilities (e.g., searching) are lost. In particular, the ability to semantically search is of the user's interest in large datasets. In this paper, we present S3C, a system that provides a semantic search functionality over encrypted data in the cloud. S3C combines approaches from traditional keyword-based searchable encryption and semantic web searching. It offers a user transparent experience that accepts a simple multi-phrase query and returns a list of documents ranked by semantic relevance to the query. Our proposed approach is space-efficient, which makes it suitable for large scale datasets. Our minimal processing also allows the system to be run on thin clients such as smart-phones or tablets. We evaluate the performance of our system against various real-world datasets, and our results show that it produces accurate search results while maintaining minimal storage overhead (~0.3% of the dataset size).

AB  - Ensuring privacy of Big Data managed on the cloud is critical to ensure consumer confidence. Cloud providers publish privacy policy documents outlining the steps they take to ensure data and consumer privacy. These documents are available as large text documents that require manual effort and time to track and manage. We have developed a semantically rich ontology to describe the privacy policy documents and built a database of several policy documents as instances of this ontology. We next extracted rules from these policy documents based on deontic logic which can be used to automate management of data privacy. In this paper we describe our ontology in detail along with the results of our analysis of privacy policies of prominent cloud services.

AB  - Systems chemical biology integrate chemistry, biology and computation tools as a whole system, which can help researchers to deeply study the interaction and relationship among small molecules, such as genes, proteins, targets, compounds and so on. With systems chemical biology, researchers can concentrate on new way of drug discovery, including drug target path discovery, which can not only help biomedical researchers to find evidences for existing disease associate genes, but also to design new effect medicine based on targets. Network based approaches are the state-of-art solutions for drug target path discovery, however, there are still some challenges: 1) The quality of the network dominate the efficiency and accuracy of the results, therefore a well designed network is quite important on drug target path discovery mission; 2) the existing network based approaches only work on small graph, it can not handle massive data well. In the paper, we designed a novel framework of systems chemical biology based on semantic big data. In the paper, we proposed a novel drug target path discovery approach. It can identify targets associated with specific medicines (disease) and the path of relationship based on a RDF semantic D-T network. The ranking of candidate targets is performed through an improved parallel random walk with restart algorithm. The experimental studies show that the proposed approaches can efficiently discover drug target relationship path, meanwhile, the approaches have good scalability which are suitable for big data analysis.

A promising approach for alleviating these risks is to provide a security-by-design framework that will assist cloud application developers in defining appropriate context-driven policies that enhance cloud security at design-time and enforce access control at run-time. This paper discusses a generic and extensible formalism, called Context-aware Security Policy Model that can be tailored to the particular needs of different cloud applications for enhancing the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive data.

AB  - Cloud computing enables enterprises to realise significant cost savings whilst accelerating the development of new innovative applications. Nevertheless, due to security concerns, enterprises are reluctant to migrate their operations to the cloud. In addition, the proliferation of cloud services transforms the enterprise IT environment into a complex ecosystem of collaborating services. One way to tame this complexity and alleviate the security concerns is to rely on policies that regulate the deployment, delivery and governance of cloud services. However, the heterogeneity inherent in such services, coupled with the dynamic nature of cloud environments, hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable policies. This paper proposes a generic framework for the definition and representation of policies that are enforceable across diverse administrative domains and are amenable to automated correctness checks.

AB  - Fog computing is a promising paradigm in terms of extending cloud computing to an edge network. In a broad sense, fog computing in Internet-of-Vehicles(IoV) provides low-latency services since fog nodes are closely located with moving cars and are locally distributed. In this paper, we propose a fog computing architecture based on a publish/subscribe model. After that, we describe a traffic congestion control scenario using a smart traffic light system which operates on top of the proposed architecture. Furthermore, we propose an upper-level domain ontology in order to enhance the expressivity of knowledge and describe a variety of semantic properties which interlink spatial information in IoV. Finally, we present an active rule where supports the exchange of event-driven messages between publishing and subscribing fog nodes.

The aims of our solution is to combine evidences obtained from Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) deployed in cloud services with data of risk assessment related to each attack pattern. Our approach presents a new qualitative solution for analyzing each symptom, indicator and vulnerability to detect the impact and likelihood of distributed and multi-steps attacks directed to cloud environments. The implementation of this approach will minimize the false positive alerts and will improve the performance of the IDS.

AB  - With the advent of Cloud Computing, organizations are increasingly migrating their information and communication technology (ICT) resources to the cloud. This has recently gained a great attention because of cloud pay-as-you-go model which drastically reduces actual IT infrastructure with high performance and continuous availability. In order to effectively utilize existing cloud resources, organizations may look for available cloud resources from different cloud providers. However, cloud resources are heterogeneous and described by different standards which prevents an easy and dynamic interoperability between organizations. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework tackling this heterogeneity issue. We develop a set of ontologies to semantically represent cloud resources by looking at three cloud resource description standards: Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA), Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), and Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI). Hence, our framework promotes the creation of a common semantic knowledge base of cloud resources described using these different standards. This knowledge base allows a seamless translation of cloud providers' resource descriptions. We developed an application to validate our approach as a proof of concept. We also evaluated the feasibility and completeness of our semantic framework on use cases obtained from standard specifications.

AB  - Linked data mining has become one of the key questions in High Performance graph mining in recent years. However, the existing Resource Description Framework (RDF) database engines are not scalable and are less reliable in heterogeneous clouds. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Acacia-RDF which is a scalable distributed RDF graph database engine developed with X10 programming language to solve this issue. Acacia-RDF partitions the RDF data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable SPARQL (an RDF query language) processor for Acacia-RDF which operates on top of partitioned RDF data. Furthermore, we designed and implemented a replication based fault tolerance mechanism for Acacia-RDF. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of LUBM (Lehigh University Benchmark) RDF benchmark data sets. We make a comparison of Acacia-RDF's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-RDF scales well with LUBM data sets. Acacia-RDF reported less than ten seconds elapsed times on 16 places for running the first and the third queries of the LUBM benchmark on LUBM 160 universities data set with 3.6 million vertices and 28.5 million edges which was 1.7GB in size. Through this work we describe and demonstrate the use of X10 language for development of scalable RDF graph data management systems.

AB  - Multi-cloud computing has been proposed as a way to reduce vendor dependence, comply with location regulations, and optimize reliability, performance and costs. Meanwhile, microservice architectures are becoming increasingly popular in cloud computing as they promote decomposing applications into small services that can be independently deployed and scaled, thus optimizing resources usage. However, setting up a multi-cloud environment to deploy a microservices-based application is still a very complex and time consuming task. Each microservice may require different functionality (e.g. software platforms, databases, monitoring and scalability tools) and have different location and redundancy requirements. Selection of cloud providers should take into account the individual requirements of each service, as well as the global requirements of reliability and scalability. Moreover, cloud providers can be very heterogeneous and offer disparate functionality, thus hindering comparison. In this paper we propose an automated approach for the selection and configuration of cloud providers for multi-cloud microservices-based applications. Our approach uses a domain specific language to describe the application's multi-cloud requirements and we provide a systematic method for obtaining proper configurations that comply with the application's requirements and the cloud providers' constraints.

AB  - Consumers want to ensure that their enterprise data is stored securely and obliviously on the cloud, such that the data objects or their access patterns are not revealed to anyone, including the cloud provider, in the public cloud environment. We have created a detailed ontology describing the oblivious cloud storage models and role based access controls that should be in place to manage this risk. We have developed an algorithm to store cloud data using oblivious data structure defined in this paper. We have also implemented the ObliviCloudManager application that allows users to manage their cloud data by validating it before storing it in an oblivious data structure. Our application uses role-based access control model and collection based document management to store and retrieve data efficiently. Cloud consumers can use our system to define policies for storing data obliviously and manage storage on untrusted cloud platforms even if they are unfamiliar with the underlying technology and concepts of oblivious data structures.

AB  - With the increase in the number of cloud services and service providers, manual analysis of Service Level Agreements (SLA), comparison between different service offerings and conformance regulation has become a difficult task for customers. Cloud SLAs are policy documents describing the legal agreement between cloud providers and customers. SLA specifies the commitment of availability, performance of services, penalties associated with violations and procedure for customers to receive compensations in case of service disruptions. The aim of our research is to develop technology solutions for automated cloud service management using Semantic Web and Text Mining techniques. In this paper we discuss in detail the challenges in automating cloud services management and present our preliminary work in extraction of knowledge from SLAs of different cloud services. We extracted two types of information from the SLA documents which can be useful for end users. First, the relationship between the service commitment and financial credit. We represented this information by enhancing the existing Cloud service ontology proposed by us in our previous research. Second, we extracted rules in the form of obligations and permissions from SLAs using modal and deontic logic formalizations. For our analysis, we considered six publicly available SLA documents from different cloud computing service providers.

AB  - Data integration continues to baffle researchers even though substantial progress has been made. Although the emergence of technologies such as XML, web services, semantic web and cloud computing have helped, a system in which biologists are comfortable articulating new applications and developing them without technical assistance from a computing expert is yet to be realized. The distance between a friendly graphical interface that does little, and a “traditional” system though clunky yet powerful, is deemed too great more often than not. The question that remains unanswered is, if a user can state her query involving a set of complex, heterogeneous and distributed life sciences resources in an easy to use language and execute it without further help from a computer savvy programmer. In this paper, we present a declarative meta-language, called VisFlow, for requirement specification, and a translator for mapping requirements into executable queries in a variant of SQL augmented with integration artifacts.

AB  - Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) is poised for a wider adoption by its relevant stakeholders, especially Cloud application developers. Despite this, the service model is still plagued with several adoption inhibitors, one of which is lack of interoperability between proprietary application infrastructure services of public PaaS solutions. Although there is some progress in addressing the general PaaS interoperability issue through various devised solutions focused primarily on API compatibility, platform-agnostic application design models, interoperability specific to differentiated services provided by the existing public PaaS providers, the resultant disparity owing to the offered services' semantics has not been addressed effectively, yet. The literature indicates that this dimension of PaaS interoperability is awaiting evolution in the state-of-the-art. This paper proposes the initial system design of a PaaS interoperability (IntPaaS) framework to be developed through the integration of semantic, agent technologies to enable transparent interoperability between incompatible PaaS services. This will involve uniform description through semantic annotation of PaaS provider services utilizing the OWL-S ontology, creating a knowledgebase that enables software agents to automatically search for suitable services to support Cloud-based Greenfield application development. The rest of the paper discusses the identified research problem along with the proposed solution to address the issue.

AB  - Nowadays, online social network are becoming more, more an integral part of our daily life. Users often spend a large amount of time in their profile, updating their status, interacting with other members of the network, hence a massive amount of content are posted over years by users which may include sensitive information are still available online which raises new challenges to data privacy. Specifying who can view data shared in online social network becomes a serious concern for average users. One of the main causes of the problem is due to the limited expressivity of the provided access control mechanisms that do not enable users to define the temporal context under which their shared data should be accessed. To address these limitations, we suggest using temporal non-monotonic description logic based system TL-JClassic+δε as formalism for representing, reasoning about dynamic temporal context based access control policies. The main features of our model is that, it allows to associate temporal constraints with each data shared in social network as well as enable data owner's to make some exception for certain rules by allowing some users to get the right to access some data while they would not be allowed to access by default,, therefore the access control decision will be dynamic, depending on the context when the request is made.

AB  - It is found that learners prefer to use micro learning mode to conduct learning activities through open educational resources (OERs). However, adaptive micro learning is scarcely supported by current OER platforms. In this paper we focus on profiling an effective micro learning process which is central to establish the raw materials and set up rules for the final adaptive process. This work consists of two parts. First, we conducted an educational data mining and learning analysis study to discover the patterns and rules in micro learning through OER. Then based on its findings, we profiled features of both learners and OERs to reveal the full learning story in order to support the decision making process. Incorporating educational data mining and learning analysis, an cloud-based architecture for Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS) was designed to integrate all necessary procedures together as a complete service for delivering micro OERs. The MLaaS also provides a platform for resource sharing and exchanging in peer-to-peer learning environment. Working principle of a key step, namely the computational decision-making of micro OER adaptation, was also introduced.

AB  - Nowadays, most of the information available on the web is in Natural Language. Extracting such knowledge from Natural Language text is an essential work and a very remarkable research topic in the Semantic Web field. The logic programming language Prolog, based on the definite-clause formalism, is a useful tool for implementing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. However, web-based services for NLP have also been developed recently, and they represent an important alternative to be considered. In this paper we present the comparison between two different approaches in NLP, for the automatic creation of an OWL ontology supporting the semantic annotation of text. The first one is a pure Prolog approach, based on grammar and logic analysis rules. The second one is based on Watson Relationship Extraction service of IBM Cloud platform Bluemix. We evaluate the two approaches in terms of performance, the quality of NLP result, OWL completeness and richness.

AB  - The industry is constantly moving towards the research, implementation and deployment of new solutions that permit the optimization of processes. Nowadays, such solutions consist mostly on ICT developments, which permit the collection, distribution, integration, analysis, and manipulation of heterogeneous data. The under way Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project targets the development of cloud-enabled tools for supporting the SMEs supply network optimization of manufacturing and logistic assets. The C2NET solution includes the implementation of paradigms as e.g. cloud computing or service-oriented and event-driven architectures, used for wide data integration. Among its requirements, the C2NET platform needs a solution for catch, process and react to events triggered in different locations of collaborative manufacturing networks, which are endowed with devices that permits the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This paper presents the architecture and main functionality of a knowledge-based approach that allows processing supply chain events handled by CPS devices. The main component of the presented solution is the SECA ontology, which is a knowledge base that can be updated at runtime. The main purpose of the ontology is to describe events, their status and the actions to be performed once a set of events are triggered in certain order. This research work offers a solution that can be employed by the C2NET platform not only to catch and process events; but also to notify linked data consumers.

AB  - This work proposes to include security and privacy into to context of Linked Open Data (LOD) and the Semantic Web. Here, a database partitioning approach to logically and physically separate data and distribute the partitions across several different cloud providers is applied. This data distribution is called fixed vertical partitioning and distribution approach (FVPD), as data schemes are vertically partitioned and distributed across various different cloud providers. Hence, this framework uses a security-by-distribution approach to storing sensitive data securely and privacy-ware in all possible cloud deployment models and thus, it provides a solution to improve the level of security and privacy. The proposed FVPD approach also becomes viable in the context of LOD and the Semantic Web. Furthermore, in relevant literature no approach in this context has been dealing with security and privacy so far. Therefore, this work transfers the FVPD approach from relational databases to Semantic Web Frameworks (Apache Jena, Sesame, etc.) that provide storage engines for RDF data and corresponding SPARQL endpoints. Above that, the query performance of such a federated environment is compared to a non-partitioned and non-distributed environment. For this, an adapted version of the TPC-W benchmark is used. Thus, this work shows how the query performance is affected when relational database data are exposed as SPARQL endpoints in RDF-based form and how the FVPD approach influences the query performance. Finally, it illustrates a mechanism to improve the level of security and privacy through a security-by-distribution approach.

AB  - Cloud computing is based on Virtual Machines (VM) or containers, which provide their own software execution environment that can be deployed by facilitating technologies on top of various physical hardware. The use of VMs or containers represents an efficient way to automatize the overall software engineering and operation life-cycle. Some of the benefits include elasticity and high scalability, which increases the utilization efficiency and decreases the operational costs. VMs or containers as software artifacts are created using provider-specific templates and are stored in proprietary or public repositories for further use. However, technology specific choices may reduce their portability, lead to a vendor lock-in, particularly when applications need to run in federated Clouds. In this paper we present the current state of development of the novel concept of a VM repository and operational environment for federated Clouds named ENTICE. The ENTICE environment has been designed to receive unmodified and functionally complete VM images from its users, and transparently tailor and optimise them for specific Cloud infrastructures with respect to their size, configuration, and geographical distribution, such that they are loaded, delivered, and executed faster and with improved QoS compared to their current behaviour. Furthermore, in this work a specific use case scenario for the ENTICE environment has been provided and the underlying novel technologies have been presented.

AB  - This paper presents a general approach for automatic composing mashups of applications distributed over the cloud. The approach implies to wrap existing services in smart and autonomic entities, namely cloud capabilities. These are able to interact and coordinate themselves in order to establish different ways to orchestrate their contained services. The main enabler of this technology is based on an explicit distinction between user's goals and the way to address them. A couple of language has been adopted to describe respectively the mashup logic in terms of goals and the available functionalities in terms of capabilities. A running example has been developed for extending B2B business processes of a fashion enterprise.

AB  - It is very challenging for scientists to find the right oceanographic data in a fast manner. A novel approach was proposed to analyze user access logs to explore the implicit relationship between oceanographic datasets. This paper reports a cloud-based data analytics framework to speed up the process for dealing with problems, such as (1) user access logs keep growing as users keep interact with data center websites; (2) the data analysis process involves several computing- intensive steps such as session reconstruction and latent semantic analysis (LSA); (3) the dynamic data volume requires on-demand computing resources to deliver time-sensitive computing services. To meet the requirement of dynamic computing-resources, cloud computing is leveraged to facilitate setting up cluster and speed up log mining process. In addition, Spark-based log partition strategies are integrated into our cloud-based framework to conduct log processing tasks in parallel. This experimental system is deployed on the NASA AIST cloud platform.

AB  - Open Data now provides access to updated data dedicated to urban development. The traditional approach of using production data for decision on land management needs to be rethought in the light of these new opportunities and should therefore addressed towards dynamic management of geographic information. Institutional sites such as INSEE semantically annotate their data facilitating the discovery of contextual data. Linked Open Data cloud network offers semantic access to a huge amount of thematic data including an important geographic subset. These new opportunities always generate a greater amount of usable data. Big Data tools, like Spark, make it easy to handle this amount unbounded data via conventional data-mining algorithms. We group all these issues under the generic name of Cloud Data that has sense only if it is integrated perfectly into a cloud computing environment for efficient processing and reactive application (SaaS application, Restfull services, D3JS library, …). We offer an example of a dedicated application for the Pau urban community in which all Cloud Data is integrated as a SaaS (Software as a Service).

Creative computing aims at combining knowledge from different disciplines. Being interdisciplinary is able to accomplish a knowledge combination which will blur the boundary between distinct fields. A series of weaved knowledge may well enable solving problems because the knowledge is the origin of creativity. This paper aims to construct a Big Data based Knowledge System (BDBKE) Framework in a way of creative computing: knowledge combination. Related work about Creative Computing, Knowledge Engineering and Big Data will be reviewed first; then each sub-system of BDBKE will be presented in details; and next the core algorithms of Ontology Classification Inference Engines will be explained step by step.

AB  - Cloud computing technology is a new paradigm which provides Information Technology (IT) resources via the Internet. This new shift in the way that IT re-sources are offered to the user brings new challenges, such as cloud service discovery. Nowadays, cloud users are faced with a dilemma as they have an abundant choice of cloud services. Moreover, many cloud providers offer a range of services which deliver similar functionality. Locating the best and most appropriate cloud service with a suitable and capable provider is a primary concern for any consumer. In order to clearly comprehend the scope of this problem, a thorough analysis of the limitations of cloud service discovery approaches is required which, in turn, will empower researchers to deliver better solutions for consumers to make an informed decision and choose the right service. This paper presents an overview of the current cloud service discovery trends and challenges in recent studies. Additionally, the reviewed approaches are classified according to service discovery architecture and techniques. Furthermore, these approaches are compared and analysed from several perspectives including approach model/architecture, service type, ontology representation (domain, language, and reasoning), dynamic discovery model, evaluation model, user's preferences techniques, data updates, and public repositories.

AB  - Hybrid cloud computing paradigm is gaining wide acceptance to multi-faceted IT organizations to meet the users' different sets of requirements for different types of applications. However, this can also create an array of issues, such as complex architectures, security, service provisioning in cases of resources failures/disaster, etc. To mitigate the impact and minimize trade-offs, we proposed an ontology-based framework to provide support for a resiliency mechanism in the hybrid cloud. We adopted ontology technology to provide a unified representations of cloud service names to facilitate the discovery and selection of the best-match cloud service in cases of failures. As types of cloud services evolve over time, we adopted ontology clustering to speed up the search process. Preliminary experiment results provided promising results.

The unique characteristics of cloud services such as dynamic and diverse services offering at different levels, as well as the lack of standardized description, are becoming important challenges in efficiently discovering cloud services for customers. In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that has the capability to automatically identify cloud services aiming at improving the accuracy when searching cloud services in real environments. Our search engine can detect cloud services effectively from the Web sources. Furthermore, we focus on learning the cloud service features, such as similarity function, semantic ontology and cloud service components to identify the cloud services. We use a real cloud service dataset to build an identifier. Our cloud service identifier can be used to automatically determine whether a given Web source is a cloud service with high accuracy.

AB  - The concept of the cloud is no longer limited to providing remote hardware or platform support with the development of cloud computing technology. Instead, it encapsulates all aspects of the content in computer field into service invoked by others. As an important part of software, data resource has become core services to the cloud platform in areas such as collaborative manufacturing and collaborative service. Since these data are complex in structure, strongly independent but related to each other, it is necessary to annotate these data to improve their operability and make them able to be utilized more widely. This paper wants to design an annotation method based on word segmentation and semantics replacement aimed at metadata according to the characteristics of the meta-data itself. As a result, these data resource can then be understood by computers and further support later studies such as data fusion and semantic retrieval.

An effective way to enhance the efficiency of the RDF data query is RDF closures. Our work is improve the RDF reasoning in MapReduce framework. The algorithm is based on packet classification efficiency of a few of candidate rules, as well as the NoSQL data storage avoiding repetition, corresponding to the RDF properties and concepts. The optimization algorithm of MapReduce is given a new closure generation process. Our approach use RDFS inference rules and the RDF triples in relationship between Map and Reduce operations and generate the RDF closures, improve the generate efficiency of closure. Based on RDF MapReduce algorithm for RDF closure, look forward more suitable RDF closure computing scheme on cloud computing environment.

AB  - Cloud computing has become an increasingly popular topic in recent years. It has provided alternatives for designing and implementing robot or intelligent space platform. Compared with traditional approaches where users purchase a robot and manage its own hardware or software on an ongoing basis. While researchers wish to transform their computing resources infrastructure into cloud, whether as virtual computing resources in a private cloud, virtual computing resources in a public cloud, physical computing resources, or as a combination of all these different resources in a hybrid cloud infrastructure. In this paper, a hybrid cloud robot framework is presented. An open source software named Apache CloudStack designed to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. We also proposed a knowledge representation method for service robots, where knowledge is represented hierarchically and described in ontology web language.

AB  - Security challenges are the most important obstacle for advancement of IT-based on-demand services and cloud computing as an emerging technology. In this paper, a structural policy management engine has been introduced to enhance the reliability of managing different policies in clouds and to provide standard and also dedicated security levels (rings) based on capabilities of the cloud provider and requirements of cloud customers. Accordingly, policy database has been designed based on capabilities and policy engine establishes appropriate relations between policy database and SLA engine to provide security terms as a service. Furthermore, policy match maker and reasoning engine have been designed for syntactic and semantic analysis of security requests based on three-levels of protection ontology to enhance the process of policy management in clouds.

AB  - Cloud computing allows access to computing resources from a number of providers, who offer multiple pricing strategies for selected product characteristics. The service offerings are becoming increasingly complex, with innovations such as spot markets making service selection more difficult. This paper utilizes a task-oriented approach to examine user requirements expressed as ontology to map requirements to cloud service characteristics to which prices are attached. The methodology described in this paper builds on previous work in semantic cloud service description and pricing of cloud services. The advantages of the approach are that there is a clear methodology for deriving prices for cloud services from multiple service characteristics based on semantic reasoning. Knowledge can be created and mapped across multiple knowledge domains such as requirements engineering, service description and cloud economics. New knowledge can be created by reasoning against ontology.

AB  - Interoperability and lacks in communication and information sharing are amongst the most common flaws in nowadays emergency management. The socio-technical concept of a Common Information Space (CIS) enhances interoperability and communication even within an organization. In addition, cloud-based implementations of a CIS offer flexibility and adaptability to existing systems and processes. Even more, this allows the efficient integration of a CIS to existing systems and infrastructures. This paper presents a framework concept for cloud-based Common Information Space for emergency management with special regard to cross country use cases. We will present the SecInCoRe concept of a CIS, that somehow can be called a European version and extension of the Unified Incident Command and Decision Support (UICDS, now XChangeCore).

AB  - This research work proposes a new platform for tourism based on ontologies: WICHAI (WebservICes platform for pHuket tourism based on ontologIes). This platform enables tourists who do not speak the Thai language to find accurate and relevant results for their queries on the internet with better processing time and flexibility. Three ontologies are collaborating efficiently in the WICHAI platform: Phuket Tourism ontology, Language ontology and User Profile ontology. Transliterated words processing is supported to search the most relevant words. The evaluation is based on the accuracy of results, relevant keywords and tourists satisfaction. Output similarity, based on the correctness of results, will be connected either with Language ontology and Phuket Tourism ontology or with User Profile ontology.

AB  - Computer applications, categorized as compute intensive tasks needs tons of processing power. For example, Meteorology programs and other exploratory or scientific applications. To process and execute this kind of high computational tasks, enormous measure of resources is required. For such situation, Cloud computing is a superior and smart approach for executing this undertakings. The benefits of cloud computing can also be availed for incorporating intelligence in utilization of this enormous resources. At present, Cloud Service Providers convey resources in traditional way by using various scheduling techniques additionally with manual intervention for selecting required resources, which sometimes degrades the resource usage performance. Research work proposed in this paper demonstrates the results obtained after implementation of compute intensive tasks over Cloud, using ontology based intelligent decision making capability applied for optimization of resource utilization. This sort of cloud which is proposed with adaptive and smart decision making capability is called `Semantic Cloud', which deals with the semantic allotment of resources for adaptive creation of virtual machines to deploy compute-intensive tasks or applications, as now-a-days the automation has been needed for making cloud resources utilization potent.

AB  - In cloud environments, the process of matching requests from users with the available computing resources is a challenging task. This is even more complex in federated environments, where multiple providers cooperate to offer enhanced services, suitable for distributed applications. In order to resolve these issues, a powerful modeling methodology can be adopted to facilitate expressing both the request and the available computing resources. This, in turn, leads to an effective matching between the request and the provisioned resources. For this purpose, the Open-Multinet ontologies were developed, which leverage the expressive power of Semantic Web technologies to describe infrastructure components and services. These ontologies have been adopted in a number of federated testbeds. In this article, DBcloud is presented, a system that provides access to Open-Multinet open data via endpoints. DBcloud can be used to simplify the process of discovery and provisioning of cloud resources and services.

AB  - In providing a 3D printing cloud manufacturing services, manufacturing capability representation and automatic management of manufacturing resources are challenging problems. In this paper, collaboration architecture of peer self-managed node is proposed to deal with these issues. Each isomorphism self-managed node accesses heterogeneous manufacturing resources, and builds a dynamic and scalable virtual additive manufacturing cloud through the collaboration between the nodes. All the additive manufacturing resources were described by ontology method, and also added some management rules through setting the using conditions. The whole distributed system is managed by the rules as an internal rule engine supports rule conversion and conflict resolution. The formed additive manufacturing cloud can provide convenient and self-management 3D printing services.

AB  - There is a common consensus on the role that social technologies could play in improving business process management. However several challenges continue to undermine this role. In this paper we discuss a specific challenge, which is the lack of formalization to describe cloud resources used by business processes. Building upon our previous work on social business processes we develop a framework that provides a semantic description of cloud resources, strategies to ensure their correct use based on this description, as well as a set of social relations connecting them. Thereby, this framework helps to guarantee a free-of-conflict resource allocation during business process execution. To illustrate our framework doability, an extension of Signavio process editor is developed using a real use case from an industrial partner.

AB  - Inspired by service computing principles, in cloud manufacturing, manufacturers encapsulate their resources into consumable services that can be looked up and accessed over the Internet. Manufacturing ontologies are used to store the service information. Manufacturers use service rules to control how their resources can be accessed. The rules are normally written in natural language. Thus, they need to be converted to semantic rules that can be understood by the search engine of the manufacturing ontologies. Manually converting service rules to semantic rules is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposed an approach that automatically converts service rules to semantic rules. The proposed scheme classifies the semantics of typical service rules into several semantic categories. Natural language processing techniques are used to process the service rules to map the semantic meanings of the rules to the relevant semantic categories. Then, the identified semantic categories are converted to semantic rules. The evaluation of the scheme shows that the scheme achieves good conversion accuracy.
