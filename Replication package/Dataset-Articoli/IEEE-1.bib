  abstract={The increasing complexity of computational problems across many scientific and technological domains often challenges traditional centralized computing resources. As the internet evolves toward Web 3.0, blockchain technology is emerging as a foundational infrastructure for decentralization, transparency, and distributed collaboration. Applications like the metaverse, which demand real-time responsiveness and high computational throughput, further underscore the need for scalable and resilient computing frameworks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for crowdsourcing computationally intensive tasks using blockchain and smart contracts. Operating atop existing blockchain networks, a Master (or Requester) node defines a computational problem, decomposes it into subtasks, and deploys a smart contract to manage task distribution. Worker nodes perform the computations off-chain using local resources and submit their results via on-chain transactions. The smart contract aggregates these results and finally, the Master validates them and automatically distributes rewards in cryptocurrency. A proof-of-concept simulation using Ganache, Solidity, and off-chain scripts demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, showcasing key features such as task decomposition, off-chain computation, and automated result handling. These findings underscore blockchain’s potential to enable transparent, automated, and scalable coordination of distributed computing tasks.},

  abstract={The growing need for secure and transparent data management in educational institutions has brought attention to Blockchain technology. This study explores the implementation of Blockchain for educational data integrity, focusing on how decentralized ledger technologies (DLTs) and Merkle root methods enhance trust, transparency, and security in academic environments. By integrating an ontology-based framework, this research provides a structured approach to organizing and verifying digital credentials, student records, and institutional data. The ontology aids in reducing conceptual ambiguity and supports interoperability among diverse educational technologies. Through technical analysis of Blockchain components, such as Merkle trees, cryptographic hashes, and block structures, the study demonstrates how Blockchain ensures tamper-proof and verifiable data transactions. Case studies from universities applying Blockchain-Based certification further highlight the feasibility and challenges of adoption, including infrastructure readiness, stakeholder resistance, and integration with legacy systems. The findings suggest that combining Blockchain with emerging technologies like AI and cloud computing can establish a resilient, scalable, and secure educational ecosystem.

  abstract={Because more people need scalable and private Large Language Model (LLM) processing in the cloud, better orchestration methods for using different cloud resources are required. This research proposes a new architecture for handling Multi-Cloud Semantic Orchestration of AI-driven data pipelines to make LLM inference workflows more efficient, secure and in line with company policies. The framework makes it possible to effectively assign tasks and control data with the help of ontology-based knowledge graphs and added metadata by semantic enrichment. Our system uses distributed coordination engines, ensures both differential privacy and secure multiparty computation and selects appropriate models for proper latency, throughput and compliance. Experimental findings from using well-known NLP datasets show that the orchestration strategy proposed here reduces latency by up to 38 % and ensures more privacy by 22 % than standard single-cloud systems. This research supports better LLM operations (LLMOps) in areas like healthcare and finance, since both need to pay close attention to data protection and privacy laws.},

  abstract={Cloud computing (CC) has the potential to augment collaboration, scalability, and accessibility, while providing cost-saving opportunities via enhanced and efficient computing, thus enabling enterprises to maintain focus. Cloud-based security ontologies are organized frameworks that delineate and classify topics pertinent to security in CC settings. They assist in standardizing language and enhance communication, interoperability, and comprehension among diverse stakeholders, including security experts, developers, and organizations. The ontology-based security strategy is one of the security solutions used by relevant parties. Nevertheless, target customers and cloud service providers see it as complex and lacking in security, since the applicable paradigms for various contexts are not clearly defined. Previous research has identified many security ideas that service providers might use, employing several evaluation methodologies. This highlights the growing need for reviewing the literature on Cloud Security Ontology (CSO). This research outlines the current state of the art in cloud computing ontology (CCO) and conducts a comprehensive literature review on the topic. Using the systematic literature review (SLR) approach, we identified 100 papers; 60 were selected based on established criteria, and 25 were assessed to be pertinent to the study. Scholars have shown active interest in four main areas of CC—service description, cloud security (CS), cloud resource management, cloud interoperability, and cloud service discovery—where cloud ontologies have had a significant impact. According to the research, fifteen of the thirty-one methods described in the literature for using ontologies in the cloud domain are still in use in legacy computing settings. The findings reveal several issues with improving company operations in cloud and multi-cloud settings via the use of ontologies. This paper delineates unsolved difficulties and potential future paths for academics in cloud ontology.},

  abstract={With the vigorous development of the digital economy and the deepening of enterprise digital transformation in China, cultivating digital talent has become a focus of academic research. This study examines the literature related to digital talent from 2015 to 2025 in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) journal database and employs a bibliometric analysis approach to investigate the research focus and trends in digital talent development. The analysis covers authors, institutions, keywords, research hotspots, and trend evolution. The findings reveal the following: First, with the advancement of digital transformation policies by governments and enterprises, the number of publications related to digital talent has significantly increased in recent years. Second, a stable core group of authors has yet to emerge domestically, and collaborations between research institutions are mostly confined to specific regions with limited collaboration. Third, digital talent research mainly focuses on the digital economy and digitalization, enterprise digitalization and digital transformation, and the cultivation of digital talent. Finally, on the basis of the analysis results of the knowledge graph and the national situation, implementation strategies for digital talent cultivation are proposed. These strategies inherently align with crowd science principles, where human-machine-object intelligence interactions drive collective evolution, collaborative innovation, and decentralized decision-making to enhance socio-economic efficacy.},

  year={2025},
  volume={18},
  number={5},
  pages={2740-2753},
  abstract={With the rapid development of cloud computing and service computing, service recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping users efficiently filter the appropriate services. However, the sparsity of service data and the presence of noise in interactions make it extremely challenging to accurately capture user preferences. Existing service recommendation methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily rely on ID aggregation, often neglecting the richness of textual semantics and are susceptible to interaction noise, resulting in suboptimal modeling of user-service relationships. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable advantages in capturing textual semantics, current methods struggle to effectively align structural representations with textual representations, limiting improvements in recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-semantic graph diffusion model for service recommendation, DiffMSR, which aims to align textual and structural representations while learning the generation process of interaction graphs in a denoising manner. This approach mitigates data sparsity and effectively reduces noise interference. Specifically, the model leverages LLMs to capture the textual semantic features of service descriptions and integrates them with structured semantic information from knowledge graphs. Through cross-semantic contrastive learning, it achieves heterogeneous semantic alignment. Furthermore, the model introduces a multisemantic diffusion-based generation framework, which iteratively denoises to construct high-quality user-service interaction graphs. This significantly enhances the multi-semantic awareness of user representations, thereby improving recommendation performance. Experiments on public service datasets demonstrate that DiffMSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving improvements of 4.13% and 6.37% in recommendation accuracy and recall, respectively.},

  abstract={Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next interaction of anonymous users based on their limited historical behaviour. However, most existing SBR methods still suffer from data sparsity issues due to short-term interactions. To alleviate the above issues, we propose a teacher and student distillation framework called TSKD for SBR. TSKD characterizes user intent by building multiple graphs. Specifically, a student graph (cross-session graph) and a teacher graph (item attribute similarity graph) are first constructed to supplement the session data. Then, graph neural networks (GNNs) and knowledge distillation (KG) are combined to leverage multiple graph structures for self-ensemble graph learning, effectively utilizing and learning item relationships from the student and teacher model. Furthermore, a multiple graph consistency constraint is introduced to align the student and teacher graphs in the feature embedding space, which enables the student model to learn more effectively from the teacher model by incorporating additional item relationships, leading to improved performance. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TSKD.},

  abstract={In this paper, we have explored and classified different vulnerabilities in the Virtual Machine (VM) based Cloud platforms in today's world. To understand the semantic relations between various intrusions and network attacks in a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), we use Protégé software to build an ontology. Additionally, the ontology-driven knowledge graph (KG) aids in continuously improving the detection capabilities by mapping these attacks. Our cloud-based NIDS can isolate the attacks detected in the network using Snort, Suricata, and Zeek tools and mapped with the proposed Ontology, focusing on Cross-VM Attacks and VM Foot Printing. Ontologies helps organize knowledge of a particular in a formal way. It is done by describing the concepts and the relationships between them. After the knowledge is organized, knowledge management systems can be used to find, connect, display, and even create new knowledge [4]. It uses semantic analysis to explain the information in a way that shows how different pieces of information are related to each other [4]. RDF validation ensures the structural integrity of our ontology, while advanced SPARQL queries are applied for constraint validation and to optimize the analysis of relationships between attack vectors. By implementing an ontology-based intrusion system with semantic technologies, we improve the effectiveness of detecting and isolating VM-based attacks in cloud environments.},

  pages={140-147},
  abstract={Cloud computing offers a diverse range of virtualized services for users. However, selecting and composing these services to generate optimal service graphs that meet user requirements is complex because it requires an expert with extensive knowledge of the cloud applications and their service composition, to manually generate service graphs. This, however, cannot often guarantee that all the requirements are met. A potentially promising approach to address this complexity is to develop a system that enables cloud users to specify their intent and then to automatically select a service graph that meets all their requirements. In this paper, we address the problem of service graph selection while considering both functional and non-functional requirements derived from user intent. Our objective is to minimize the total deployment cost of the service graph in a data center network and to determine its placement within the distributed data center network. We formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP), taking into account the bandwidth and latency requirements of user intent. To solve this, we propose our Service Graph Selection (SGS) solution, which aims to achieve a near-optimal solution in a computationally efficient manner. Our results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a deployment cost that is only 4–6% larger than the lower bound of the optimal deployment cost.},

  pages={274-281},
  abstract={The rapid expansion of cloud computing has led to increased energy consumption, raising concerns about its environmental impact. Despite advancements in scheduling algorithms, existing methods face critical challenges, including suboptimal energy efficiency, limited adaptability to dynamic cloud environments, and insufficient context-aware decision-making. Recent techniques, such as Meta Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and Energy-Aware Scheduling, show potential but often struggle with high computational complexity, static resource allocation, or scalability issues. These shortcomings result in inefficient resource utilization, elevated energy usage, and difficulties in meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Energy Efficient Semantic Scheduling Framework (ESSF), a novel approach combining semantic reasoning and energy profiling to optimize task scheduling in dynamic cloud environments. The framework integrates three key components: (1) Dynamic Energy Profiling (DEP) for real-time energy monitoring, (2) Semantic Resource Matching (SRM) utilizing knowledge graphs for context-aware allocation, and (3) Adaptive Workload Balancing (AWB) to dynamically redistribute tasks for improved resource utilization and energy efficiency. Experiments using the Google Cluster Trace Dataset demonstrate that ESSF reduces energy consumption by up to 25% compared to traditional methods while achieving 90% resource utilization and 97% SLA compliance. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to overcome existing limitations, offering a scalable, adaptive, and environmentally sustainable solution for task scheduling in cloud computing.},

  pages={380-395},
  abstract={The digital transformation of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) within the Industry 4.0 paradigm is essential for industrial organizations to remain competitive, while cybersecurity is an enabler. However, security measures, often implemented late in the engineering process, lead to costly and complicated implementations. Thus, this article is concerned with the “security by design” principle in ICSs and facilitates compliance with ICS security standards, which can be legally mandated for some critical systems or adopted by asset owners to protect their assets. Current methods for compliance demand manual efforts from security experts, making the compliance process time-consuming and costly. To address this, we propose a framework for leveraging large language models (LLMs) combined with knowledge graphs to automate the interpretation of security requirements and system architecture as two main elements of the design phase. Our knowledge graph-augmented LLM framework converts system architectures into human natural language, enhancing the automation of various security analyses, especially those that need to handle textual requirements. The framework enables validating applicable security requirements provided by IEC 62443-3-3 (a widely-used ICS security standard) concerning system designs through a question-and-answer interface. To evaluate the framework, various questions with reference responses from human experts were prepared in the context of a use case, and the quality of the LLMs' responses was measured across various metrics. Moreover, we compared the framework with a baseline approach based on formal queries. The results show that the proposed framework effectively automates security tasks and offers a user-friendly interface accessible to nonexperts.},

  abstract={In Web 3.0’s pursuit of a decentralized and user-autonomous network, traditional access control methods, such as central servers and weak decentralized algorithms, are insufficient regarding security, fault tolerance ability, and scalability. To solve this, we first design a decentralized multi-committee attribute-based encryption, X-ABE, to address the weak decentralization and low fault tolerance in Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE). X-ABE replaces MA-ABE’s fragile attribute authorities with robust attribute committees, each composed of multiple nodes. By developing dual-wrapped shares techniques, we address the increased dimensionality challenge of secret sharing while maintaining only 1 distributed key generation instance. Also, a formal security definition and proof under the partial adaptive model are given using dual system encryption. Second, X-LOCK, an X-ABE based decentralized access control utilizing consensus plus sharding, is proposed for Web 3.0, to achieve full decentralization, consistency, fault tolerance, user autonomy, and scalability. Third, X-ABE-R is proposed for attribute revocation and is demonstrated in X-LOCK-R with sharding blockchain as an immutable revocation ledger. Fourth, a formal definition and comparative analysis of X-ABE’s fault tolerance abilities are demonstrated, covering aspects of liveness and safety, along with the complexity analysis. Fifth, practical evaluations are conducted, demonstrating that while improving fault tolerance, the overhead remains acceptable.},

  year={2025},
  volume={22},
  number={2},
  pages={1690-1702},
  abstract={In the context of the rapid development of service-oriented computing and cloud computing, selecting the service that meets the user’s needs from an ever-increasing number of Web services is always challenging. Exploiting auxiliary information such as a Knowledge Graph (KG) can significantly improve the effectiveness of service recommendations. However, current KG-based service recommendation methods usually merely integrate the knowledge semantic information into the user-service interaction model, which ignores the importance of global structure and does not fully consider the in-depth learning of individual user preferences. To this end, this paper proposes a Multi-Level View Contrastive Learning for Service Recommendation (MCSR) approach to address the above challenges. In particular, unlike traditional approaches that consider only two views, we consider three views, i.e., the global structure view, the local collaboration view, and the semantic view. Specifically, the user-service graph is regarded as the collaboration view, the service-entity graph as the semantic view, and the user-service-entity graph as the structural view. By applying contrastive learning across these views at different levels, MCSR fully leverages graph features and structural information, integrating auxiliary relational semantics into user-service interaction modeling. Furthermore, recognizing that the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly improving recommendation accuracy., since the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy. The experimental results show that MCSR significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, with the positive impact of its key components on the recommended performance verified by ablation experiments.},

  pages={125-131},
  abstract={The process of selecting Software as a Service (SaaS) in Cloud Computing depends on providers’ capabilities to articulate the non-functional attributes of their SaaS offerings semantically and understand customer requests along with their non-functional requirements. This study conceptualizes SaaS selection as a multi-criteria combinatorial problem within predefined constraints. To address this, we introduce a hybrid approach incorporating an entire optimization algorithm. Our method leverages semantic and microservice (individual) SaaS descriptions in the Ontology Web Language for Services (OWL-S). Each micro SaaS is linked to compatible SaaS instances (offering similar functionality) in a unified environment, guided by the compatibility concept. A micro-SaaS may not satisfy a particular functional need in specific contexts. However, it is possible to meet customer requirements by combining the available SaaS instances, called virtual SaaS. The chosen SaaS should be the best based on the defined quality and quantitative criteria. Our proposed approach, employing multi-criteria analysis, capitalizes on a dedicated Quality of Service (QoS) ontology tailored for the cloud environment and web applications. Moreover, a simulation design proved that a substantial selection of SaaS(s) could be achieved in a cloud.},

  abstract={Web 3.0 is viewed as the next generation of the Internet, with the aim of establishing a decentralized network where users can control their digital identities and data. Due to its decentralization feature, blockchain has become a promising solution for secure data storage and retrieval for abundant de-centralized applications in Web 3.0. In this context, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are rapidly emerging as a key infrastructure for blockchain-based Web 3.0. However, with more and more DIDs generated and stored on the blockchain, it is challenging to support efficient retrieval of DIDs with data integrity assurance. In this paper, we propose a novel authenticated DID retrieval system for blockchain-based Web 3.0. Specifically, a new authenticated data structure (ADS) with the corresponding data verification algorithm is designed to enable efficient retrieval and verification for both DID records and their historical updates. Theoretical analysis has been performed to prove the security and efficiency of our proposed system. We implement our system and conduct experiments to evaluate the performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme exhibits higher system efficiency compared to the baseline solution.},

  abstract={In traditional unmanned surface vehicle operations, cloud collaboration methods based on cloud service architecture virtualize all operational resources of unmanned platforms for registration and unified management in the cloud. Resources are dynamically provided to requesters through service discovery. However, traditional service matching algorithms fail to flexibly allocate platform resources and facilitate efficient collaboration between different unmanned platforms. This paper explores the cloud service discovery process for unmanned surface vehicles and designs a matching method for cloud service functional attributes based on an ontology knowledge representation model. Through an example of the cloud service discovery process, the feasibility of this method is verified. It enables flexible registration and management of shipborne sensor, communication, and weapon resources, providing a path for quick and accurate cloud service discovery among unmanned surface vehicles.},

  abstract={Web 3.0 pursues the establishment of decentralized ecosystems through blockchain technologies, driving digital transformation in commerce and governance. With consensus algorithms and smart contracts grounded in cryptographic technologies, Web 3.0 enables secure and transparent digital services, such as digital identity, asset management, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and decentralized finance (DeFi), fostering integration between digital and physical economies. As quantum devices rapidly advance, Web 3.0 is being developed in parallel with the deployment of quantum cloud computing and quantum Internet. In this regard, quantum computing first disrupts the original cryptographic systems that protect data security while reshaping modern cryptography with enhanced quantum computing and communication capabilities. This article provides a comprehensive overview of blockchain-based Web 3.0, examining its quantum and postquantum advancements from two key perspectives. On the one hand, postquantum migration methods and quantum-resistant signatures offer robust solutions to safeguard blockchain against quantum threats. On the other hand, quantum and postquantum encryption and verification algorithms boost blockchain performance, creating a decentralized, secure, and value-driven system. Additionally, we outline potential applications of quantum blockchain and offer guidance for implementation within the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Finally, we discuss future directions for developing a provably secure and decentralized digital ecosystem.},

This paper visually analyzes the text of Five Thousand Years of Chinese history from three dimensions: keyword word cloud map, character relationship knowledge graph, and Sankey map of historical events. Firstly, the keyword cloud map was realized by Python and multiple third-party libraries, which was convenient for readers to quickly appreciate the key points expressed in the text. Secondly, entity recognition was performed through hanLP, triple relationships were obtained through the deep learning model, and the knowledge graph of character relationships was stored through Neo4j, which was convenient for readers to understand historical characters and clarify the relationship between characters. Finally, Sankey diagrams are generated according to the characters, events and time order through the ECharts visualization chart library, which is convenient for readers to sort out the relationship between characters and events, and clarify the historical order. It provides a new perspective for the visual analysis of single text and temporal text in the field of digital humanities research, and provides a broader foundation for future research.},

  abstract={Multimodal knowledge graph integrates information from different modalities to enhance knowledge representation, but multimodal knowledge graphs still have deficiencies in completeness and accuracy. Most existing completion methods rely on entity text, images, and triplet information, ignoring the relationship path information between entities. In addition, due to the heterogeneity between text and images, there is often semantic conflict, and directly fusing information from different modalities makes it difficult to accurately capture the deep associations between text and images. Therefore, we propose a multimodal knowledge graph completion method based on relationship path enhancement with multi feature deep fusion. This method identifies and strengthens key relationship paths, while also deeply mining the deep semantic connections between multiple modalities, achieving deep integration between multiple features. Finally, the model was experimentally verified on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR datasets, results showed that the model improved on most metrics, which evidence the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The example of tools for cognitologs and engineers to create portals with XAI-system production conditions are the instruments implemented on the «IACPaaS» platform. Several thematic cloud portals for collective development of XAI services have already been created here. An example is the specialized manufacturing environment of the Medical Portal, which made it possible to create multifunctional clinical software services to support decision-making based on diseases-centric knowledge graphs, the completeness and relevance of which is maintained remotely.},

  abstract={Automated analysis and specification of software requirements expressed in natural language is a challenge addressed by the research community and is becoming a reality thanks to the advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. While the research community focuses mainly on generic software requirements or specialized solutions for security requirements, we find a gap in the automation of analysis and specification for requirements in the cloud computing domain and the automatic mapping of requirements on actual products offered in the cloud service market. In this research work, we propose AI-CRAS an AI-driven cloud service requirement analysis and specification methodology. The proposed method, which leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based large language model, has been implemented and validated in a real case. Experimental results demonstrate that the model performed well in binary and multi-label classification of requirements (achieving recall/F1-score of $0.96 / 0.92$ and $0.86 / 0.76$, respectively) and mapping requirements into actual cloud services.},

  abstract={The Operations Knowledge Base provides integrated services for operations knowledge from different cloud service providers, including troubleshooting experience, configuration management information, and performance monitoring data. By building a knowledge base, operators can quickly retrieve the information they need, significantly improving the speed and accuracy of problem solving. With the development of artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology, the O&M knowledge base can also provide intelligent services and applications, such as intelligent search, automatic fault diagnosis, and intelligent recommendation, to improve user experience and efficiency. However, implementing these features requires solving complex technical problems such as semantic understanding, knowledge reasoning, and so on. Based on the current cloud platform O&M knowledge system and business model, this paper constructs a multi-dimensional cloud platform O&M knowledge base, mines the knowledge association relationship with the help of natural language processing technology, and forms a visual knowledge graph network covering the whole domain of the cloud platform. At the same time, a method of building a multi-heterogeneous O&M knowledge base based on cloud platform is explored and verified to improve the efficiency and quality of cloud O&M.},

This paper discusses the key challenges and solutions of data encryption technology in cloud computing, focusing on the application of symmetric and asymmetric encryption technologies and their effects. Comparative experimental analyses show that symmetric encryption has a processing speed of about 10,000 encryption operations per second and low resource consumption, while asymmetric encryption has a processing speed of about 500 encryption operations per second but excels in security and key management. The experimental results show that the combined use of symmetric and asymmetric encryption can achieve more efficient and secure data protection in cloud computing environments.

  abstract={Interoperable digital twins (DT) simplify and automate the implementation of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) use cases like Collaborative Condition Monitoring (CCM), Product and Corporate Carbon Footprint (PCF, CCF) and the Digital Product Passport (DPP) - aiming at adaptivity, resource-efficiency, user-friendliness, compliance with legal requirements and value-creation. Platforms accelerate the development and deployment of DTs and services and ensure their resilient operation in order to capture especially all relevant shop-floor information, for example to aggregate PCFs, CCFs, and DPPs or to report on sustainability - automatically. However, platform operators should in particular avoid cloud provider lock-ins to be able to react flexibly to use case requirements at any time. The technology must be manageable and costs must be controllable. The aim is to achieve a break-even point between security, costs, future viability and controllability, short implementation time and motivated use. Such requirements can currently only be met with cloud infrastructures. An agnostic design ensures that switching infrastructures is possible and can be done both securely and quickly. To this end, this paper develops an out-of-the-box cloud native and cloud agnostic DT platform providing specialized, stateless, loosely coupled DT services interacting within a service mesh. The developed platform meets the requirements, can easily be executed in any public, private and hybrid cloud, and can be scaled horizontally without any further ado.},

  abstract={A cloud computing resource scheduling algorithm based on sampled collaborative knowledge graph network is designed to address the issues of lag in the process of cloud computing resource scheduling, high overall load rate, and large transient amplitude and phase errors. Based on graph convolutional neural networks, analyze the target load of cloud platforms, construct multi hop data transmission paths one by one, and perform deep level information load balancing; Establish a multiplexing information transmission model, correct the initial weights of graph convolutional neural networks, combine reverse transmission calculation methods, integrate and balance cloud computing resources, and confirm the optimal resource scheduling plan; Integrating class convolution and human-machine interaction attention mechanism, the value of the previous time series neural unit is transferred to the current neural unit, and the classification output sequence of knowledge graph relational data feature fragments is analyzed. The knowledge graph data fragments are processed based on class convolution and human-machine interaction attention mechanism, and different sizes of linear aggregators are used to capture deep level information, completing the design of cloud computing resource scheduling algorithm. The experimental results show that although the load rate is on the rise, the highest is only 89%, and the scheduling rate is relatively high, ranging from 38.9 to 43.1bps; The energy consumption is relatively low, not exceeding 40.106mW. In terms of transient amplitude and phase, the proposed method can control the error within 2.0.

  abstract={In the ever-evolving landscape of the internet, the emergence of Web 3.0 has ushered in a new era of decentralized applications. As researchers navigate through Web 3.0, the criticality of secure data sharing becomes evident, necessitating a robust solution to address vulnerabilities present in current methods. The existing methods grapple with vulnerabilities, especially in centralized repositories susceptible to breaches due to intricate and less secure authentication processes. Furthermore, the compromise of data integrity and privacy during the process of data sharing exacerbates the challenges faced by current methods. This research conducts a thorough examination of the pivotal role played by blockchain in enhancing security measures and empowering consumers with control over their data. Furthermore, it introduces a novel approach by proposing a secure Web 3.0 data-sharing platform, leveraging IPFS, Pinata, Smart Contracts, Meta Masks, and decentralized principles. To evaluate the security of the proposed secure data sharing platform, this study utilized two smart contract vulnerability detector tools, namely Slither and Echidna. The findings revealed a minimal presence of issues, with Slither identifying only five low-level, nonthreatening problems and Echidna indicating no critical failures. This demonstrates the platform's robustness against significant vulnerabilities such as the reentrancy attack and integer overflow and validates its ability to facilitate safe, decentralized data sharing in the context of the Web 3.0 paradigm.},

  number={},
  pages={765-775},
  abstract={In addition to stationary sensors/actuators (nodes), mobile nodes such as vehicles and smartphones are connected to M2M (Machine-to-Machine) systems. Some M2M systems take into account node mobility, while some M2M systems regard vehicles as compute servers. N one of them, however, handle the mobility of nodes that act as compute servers. This paper proposes an MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) based M2M system called MECM2M, which can handle the mobility of nodes acting as sensors/actuators and compute servers. The design policy of MECM2M is analogous to that of the Internet. The Internet provides two fundamental services: reliable byte stream and unreliable datagram. How data is used is up to applications. MECM2M provides M2M applications with three fundamental services as the M2M services: area-based data acquisition, node-based data acquisition, and node-based action instruction. How sensing data is used is up to M2M applications. MECM2M introduces the virtual nodes as digital twins in the virtual space for the physical nodes. The virtual nodes conceal differences from the physical nodes and provide a uniform interface. The relation among the virtual nodes, the physical nodes, and the locations of the physical nodes is managed by a domain ontology called Onto- Mecm2m,which enables effective processing of the three fundamental services. The evaluation results on an MECM2M emulator show that the response times of the three fundamental services satisfy the latency constraints, i.e., 100 ms, defined in an ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) document.},

An important component of SSI is a wallet that stores cryptographic keys and other identity data. Secure backup and recovery methods for data stored in such wallets are a crucial feature for its wide-scale adoption, however, such a feature is lacking or implemented casually in the existing SSI wallets. In this research, we propose a secure backup and storage of SSI wallets using a novel technology called Solid Pod. Solid Pod is an emerging technology that enables users to securely store data online. Towards this aim, we present the architecture, based on a threat model and requirement analysis, of the proposed approach. We also discuss its implementation details, outline a number of protocol flows highlighting different use-cases and analyse its security, advantages and limitations.},

  abstract={Most existing models for entity alignment tasks are based on a single pre-training mode. Through multiple experiments, it has been verified that a single pre-training model is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of current entity alignment tasks. Based on considerations of multiple pre-training models, this paper proposes an entity alignment method that utilizes multiple pre-training models. The purpose of this method is to address the limited accuracy in entity alignment tasks, with a particular focus on separately pre-training the embedding of entity attribute information and link relationship information for matching. To achieve the goal of improving entity alignment accuracy, this paper adopts joint alignment using pre-training with BERT and GloVe word embeddings. Experimental evaluations are conducted on the DBP15k dataset, and the results demonstrate that leveraging multiple pre-training models for attribute and relationship joint alignment can enhance model performance. The evaluation metrics of the model on three different language datasets, Hits@1 and MRR, are as follows: 0.899, 0.930, 0.964, and 0.932, 0.951, 0.975, respectively. These metrics indicate that the model performs well in aligning entities and outperforms current mainstream entity alignment methods.},

  abstract={The creation and execution of applications in several disciplines have been greatly aided by the integration of cloud computing and semantic web technologies. Although they are independent entities, they may also be combined in many ways to provide answers—a subject that has been thoroughly researched lately. The number of “new cloud providers, applications, facilities, management systems, and data” has significantly increased in recent years. The complexity that has resulted from this expansion emphasises the need for new technology in order to efficiently manage and support these varied and many services and resources. As a result, difficulties with “cloud services and resources” transferability, compatibility, security, choice, negotiation, identity, and specification might arise. Semantic Technologies are a vital tool for reassessing these issues because of their enormous “cloud computing” capacity. This study uses a variety of sources to examine and evaluate the impact of “Semantic-Web Technology” in the cloud. Moreover, a cloud-based engagement strategy shows how we may leverage the features and advantages of cloud computing to build the semantic web and provide automatic semantic annotations to online applications on a large scale.},

  pages={1958-1971},
  abstract={The widespread availability of Internet access and online services has led to the generation of numerous large-scale graphs in various real-world applications, such as online social networks and knowledge graphs. Keyword search stands out as a crucial task in the analysis and mining of these graphs. However, graph data owners tend to outsource storage and computation tasks to the cloud due to limited computing and storage resources. In this case, it is critical to ensure the integrity of the query results, as the cloud may have an incentive to return tampered results to serve its own interests. Currently, blockchain systems can store data efficiently and securely, creating a decentralized, tamper-proof digital platform. This functionality positions blockchain as a crucial complement and enhancement to traditional cloud storage solutions. Mainstream blockchains use a hybrid storage system to improve scalability, storing small meta-data on-chain and outsourcing raw data off-chain. While cryptographic proofs protect data integrity for queries, current schemes only support key-value data. This paper pioneers the study of authenticated keyword searches on graphs in hybrid-storage blockchains. The key challenge is to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) based on the graph data that can efficiently deal with keyword search queries. We propose Merkle Path DAG (MP-DAG), a novel ADS that aggregates the unqualified paths that will not appear in the result trees to efficiently handle authenticated keyword search queries on graphs. Furthermore, to reduce the ADS storage cost, we design an optimization scheme MP-DAG* by combining the similar subgraphs of MP-DAG. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed ADS and optimization measure.},

  pages={400-405},
  abstract={The fragmented architecture, cloud-based infrastructure, and functionally virtualized network elements within the 5 G core network have significantly surged the volume and diversity of alarms generated on cloud network service platforms that it supports. Given the inherently cross-layered nature of failure scenarios on these platforms, identifying the root causes presents a significant challenge. Alarm association rule mining has become an effective means to address the problems of alarm correlation and root cause localization. In this paper, an explainable alarm association rule mining approach based on knowledge graph, referred to as ARK-G, is proposed. Initially, a cloud-network cross-layer alarm association knowledge graph (CA2KG) is constructed. Subsequently, the knowledge embedding based graph convolutional network is employed to perform knowledge graph embedding on CA2KG. This embedding is then utilized to enhance the RNNLogic algorithm, thereby facilitating cross-layer alarm association rule mining with interpretable paths. Finally, a weighted rule tree is derived from a subset of CA2KG and the generated explainable rules, enabling the deduction of the root alarm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ARK-G approach for association rule mining yields a higher hit rate compared to the baseline model, which provides valuable assistance in the faults analysis of 5 G cloud-network platforms.},

  abstract={Cloud computing technologies, including cloud-native and containerization, have gained prominence in recent years, attributed to their exceptional scalability, enhanced resource utilization, and expedited deployment capabilities. However, their inherent complexity and the intricate interplay of internal components heighten the risk of sporadic and unforeseen anomalies. To address these challenges, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is employed to accurately identify problematic services (pods) and mine the precise faults behind observed anomalies. Tailored to the limitations of conventional RCA algorithms, we propose a novel approach that jointly models operation entities and their relationships as learnable embeddings. Additionally, this method integrates fault propagation information to further improve RCA accuracy. Our evaluation involves developing a prototype within the Kubernetes cloud-native system. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach.},

This mechanism is essential to a shared language and meaning, enabling effective communication and collaboration. Using Docker for containerization we can encapsulate these semantically enriched heterogeneous systems in isolated environments, ensuring their seamless deployment and management. This ensures that sensor reading and user notifications are effectively exchanged between different components in the system. As a container orchestration platform, Kubernetes enables autoscaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance, and ensures high availability and reliability of Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (MHEWS), even if the infrastructure fails. This enables easy integration and interoperability of various software components and increases system scalability and reliability. In this study, we detail architectural design and implementation considerations for the Multi-Hazard Early Warning System, with a focus on using semantic middleware and containerization technologies, we will explore how the technologies can improve data interoperability and improve system performance.},

  abstract={Cloud service owners need to continuously monitor their services to ensure high availability and reliability. Gaps in monitoring can lead to delay in incident detection and significant negative customer impact. Current process of monitor creation is ad-hoc and reactive in nature. Developers create monitors using their tribal knowledge and, primarily, a trial and error based process. As a result, monitors often have incomplete coverage which leads to production issues, or, redundancy which results in noise and wasted effort. In this work, we address this issue by proposing an intelli-gent monitoring framework that recommends monitors for cloud services based on their service properties. We start by mining the attributes of 30,000+ monitors from 791 production services at Microsoft and derive a structured ontology for monitors. We focus on two crucial dimensions: what to monitor (resources) and which metrics to monitor. We conduct an extensive empirical study and derive key insights on the major classes of monitors employed by cloud services at Microsoft, their associated dimensions, and the interrelationship between service properties and this ontology. Using these insights, we propose a deep learning based framework that recommends monitors based on the service properties. Finally, we conduct a user study with engineers from Microsoft which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed framework. The proposed framework along with the ontology driven projections, succeeded in creating production quality rec-ommendations for majority of resource classes. This was also validated by the users from the study who rated the framework's usefulness as 4.27 out of 5.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is a popular technology that provides users with storage and collaboration tools, as well as computing power. Due to the need to store large amounts of data, there is a growing trend towards the widespread use of cloud services every year. However, transferring personal information to the cloud raises several privacy concerns. The transition to the next generation of networks requires the highest level of security for users' personal data, necessitating a revision of current methods for its transmission and storage as well as the adoption of new cryptographic approaches. Homomorphic encryption is one such method that allows calculations to be performed on encrypted data without requiring the decryption of these data. This approach solves the problem of securely transmitting and storing personal information while still allowing for the required calculations to be made. This article will focus on the implementation of a homomorphic encryption scheme (Gentry et al.) using the advanced computing power of modern PCs. To track the dynamics of growth in implementation efficiency, an identical experiment was conducted on devices of different generations of the MacBook Air line. The results were compared with software implementations using Intel Core i5 processors and Apple M2 processors. As a result of the execution time evaluation, a reduction in the range from 45.15% to 65.95% is achieved for a number of basic processes of the Gentry algorithm.},

  abstract={The metaverse, as a paradigm continuously evolving in the next generation of the Internet, aims to integrate various network applications. However, existing applications on the Internet, such as serve computing, and edge computing, have highly complex technical requirements. These applications face compatibility issues with the metaverse in terms of protocols, applications, and services. So they cannot be directly integrated into the metaverse. How to efficiently deploy service computing in the metaverse has become a hotspot research area. Moreover, metaverse implements innovative services to offer individuals more immersive experiences, such as acrlong VR services and augmented Reality services. These new services demand high-computational resources, including computing power, network performance, data security, etc. Ensuring optimal service quality for these new services in the metaverse is another critical aspect of metaverse research. To address the aforementioned challenges, Meta-services, designed to describe, discover, compose, and manage other services, are gradually attracting widespread attention and research. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review, analysis, and discussion of existing research work. We summarize the services computing and novel services in metaverse and categorize the meta-services framework into three layers: 1) meta-bottom layer (meta-data); 2) meta-middle layer (meta-models, meta-objects, and meta-languages); and 3) meta-top layer (meta-programming). Based on the meta-services framework, we discuss some current challenges, as well as provide future research directions. We hope that this article can enable readers to quickly understand the reasons for each problem and the current research progress, thereby providing guidance and motivation for further research in this field.},

  number={4},
  pages={457-469},
  abstract={In light of the global proliferation of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a notable surge in public interest towards Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) recently. Within the realm of personalized course-learning services, large amounts of online course recommendation systems have been developed to cater to the diverse needs of learners. However, despite these advancements, there still exist three unsolved challenges: 1) how to effectively utilize the course information spanning from the title-level to the more granular keyword-level; 2) how to well capture the sequential information among learning courses; 3) how to identify the high-correlated courses in the course corpora. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solution known as Cascaded Knowledge-level Fusion Network (CKFN) for online course recommendation with incorporating a three-fold approach to maximize the utilization of course information: 1) two knowledge graphs spanning from the keyword-level to title-level; 2) a two-stage attention fusion mechanism; 3) a novel knowledge-aware negative sampling method. Experimental results on a real dataset of XuetangX demonstrate that CKFN surpasses existing baseline models by a substantial margin, thereby achieving the state-of-the-art recommendation performance. It means that CKFN can be potentially deployed into MOOCs platforms as a pivotal component to provide personalized course recommendation service.},

  abstract={Web 3.0 is a promising next-generation Internet paradigm that is driven by multiple technologies, e.g., semantic communications, besides blockchain to enable transparent and traceable data sharing. Specifically, semantic communication can provide Web 3.0 services with a promising and lightweight paradigm for semantic information transmission. However, a unified integration framework has not been studied. Moreover, how to achieve efficient semantic sharing and pricing challenges the traditional centralized communication paradigm. Therefore, this paper integrates blockchain and semantic communication to share valuable semantic information for Web 3.0 services. The Proof of Semantic mechanism is designed to reduce the garbage-in garbage-out challenge of Web 3.0 services. Moreover, we utilize the state channel and the information bottleneck to construct a task-relevant semantic sharing mechanism to exchange information efficiently in Web 3.0 services. To maximize semantic information's utility, we propose a semantic pricing mechanism based multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game to circulate information in Web 3.0 services. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanisms are both verifiable and efficient, achieving reduced communication overheads while maintaining test accuracy comparable to benchmark methods.},

  abstract={Genealogical research and visualization are key to comprehending complex familial relationships. This paper introduces “Dynastic Nexus,” an advanced genealogy platform designed to navigate complex hierarchies of relationships, perform network analysis, and dynamically visualize family trees. Users explore generations and diverse kinship routes, unraveling the complexities of extended family networks. Its user-centric interface imports genealogical data, extracts profiles, and provides a personalised approach by displaying the family tree from that particular individual's perspective, offering insights into one's heritage and allowing for a deeper understanding of their place within the family. Employing advanced graph algorithms, “Dynastic Nexus” conducts in-depth connection analysis, revealing intricate relationships like parent-child, spousal, and sibling connections. Unique links such as cousins, nieces, and aunts add depth to understanding extended family dynamics. We also include a case study of determining relationships in Indian families, which tend to be more complex due to various social, cultural, and historical factors. Different algorithms employ distinct traversal strategies, and choosing the right strategy can impact pathfinding efficiency. As the graph scales, making an informed algorithmic choice to avoid impractical and resource-intensive exhaustive searches and to navigate accurately through marriages, divorces, adoptions, and step-relationships becomes crucial. We conduct a comparative analysis of various graph algorithms for determining relationships between two nodes within a genealogical tree across an escalating series of synthesized graph data.},

  abstract={Because of the increasing complexity, openness and extensibility of services-based Information Systems (IS), Web Services Composition (WSC) became a main challenge that interests many researchers. This interest is growing with the apparition of Cloud applications that are being increasingly available and diversified trying to cover a multitude of services to satisfy the unlimited end-user requirements. In front of applications diversity, it become more difficult for end-user to find the most adequate service that perfectly meet their needs especially when considering personalization in WSC process. This difficulty increases when dealing with security constraints, especially in cloud environment where services are openly accessible and widely exposed to highly potential risks. In such context, WSC must be made in a careful way and personalization should proactively take into account protection measures against all eventual threats. Otherwise, integrating both personalization and security in WSC may result in an instable system.Based on this conviction, finding the correlation between these concepts remains an important issue. Hence, the key challenge of this paper is to study the stability system’s through a correlation equation between the precited concepts. To highlight the efficiency of our proposed equation, we will present an E-Learning application that was used during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract={Decentralized Cloud Storage (DCS) is considered to be the future for sustainable data storage within Web 3.0, in which we will move from a single cloud service provider to creating an ecosystem where anybody could be a cloud storage provider. Currently, the cloud storage market is highly dominated by centralized players like Amazon S3, Google Cloud, Box, etc. Decentralized projects like Storj, Filecoin, and Sia have seen rising popularity with the advent of Web 3.0 applications. At the same time, any blockchain network is susceptible to large-scale DDoS attacks. This work focuses on the Storj DCS, where we aimed to analyze the robustness of the system under the influence of a coordinated DDoS attack which can be carried out by an adversary or a group of adversaries taking down a set of storage nodes. The novelty of our work lies in threefold: First, we use statistical methods to mathematically model the content distribution as well as the loss of a file or a segment from the system. Our model captures both the cases where we have homogeneous and non-homogeneous nodes. Secondly, we develop a cost-analytic approach to perform a robustness analysis of the Storj system and implement the proposed model in MATLAB. Finally, we calculate the cost of a DDoS attack that the adversary has to incur in order to be successful with the attack. Also, we propose a set of better parametric choices for erasure piece distribution under which the system has proved to be more robust than the parametric values implemented in Storj DCS.},

  abstract={Hybrid intelligence has emerged as an innovative approach that synergistically combines the strengths of human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI) to address complex problems. In this paradigm, knowledge graphs play a pivotal role by supplying vital background information and contextual understanding to hybrid intelligence systems. However, due to limitations in local storage capacity, managing large-scale graph data often requires outsourcing to cloud servers. Nevertheless, the use of untrusted cloud servers poses a risk of potential user data leaks. To address these concerns, this paper presents an encryption scheme specifically designed to protect graph data, enabling queries involving intermediate nodes in the shortest path between two nodes within the graph. The proposed scheme ensures the privacy and security of outsourced data by employing a novel method that utilizes padding dictionary structure encryption. This method ensures strict limitations on the cloud server's capabilities, restricting it solely to query operations, it effectively prevents any compromise of user data or unauthorized access to sensitive information, users can securely store and process their graph data on servers, significantly reducing the potential risk of data leakage and unauthorized breaches. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution, practical experiments were conducted using real-world data.},

  abstract={Scalable solutions are required to handle fluctuating workloads in modern distribution grids in order to manage the flood of data from many sources, execute dynamic algorithms as needed, and effectively operate sparse actuators. In order to meet these needs, cloud computing technologies have surfaced as a suitable answer, facilitating effective data sharing and interchange. With semantic information integration playing a crucial role, this is especially important for fully exploiting the advantages of cloud computing in enabling sophisticated analytics and mining for smart grids. In order to analyze grid data for power distribution, this essay proposes integrating the semantic web into a cloud-based research platform. The idea recommends using a service restoration technique to reenergize loads after an electrical failure. This presentation is implemented using FIWARE, a platform composed of modular, open-source building pieces designed for future internet services and applications. Moreover, the SARGON ontology-which was created especially for the energy domain-is used here. We test the integration of semantic data into the cloud-based service restoration application using the IEC61850 data model. This integration provides an access to the distribution grid's field devices. The platform's performance test, measured in terms of computing time and network latency, validates the viability of the suggested solution. The results of these experiments provide as a standard against which to measure the performance of smart energy platforms in the future, therefore advancing the field.},

  abstract={While AI and automation have made significant strides in customer support, there are still situations where human intervention via voice channels is necessary to provide the best possible customer experience. In fact, although AI and chatbots have become increasingly sophisticated, they may not always be able to handle complex or nuanced customer issues. Human agents can better understand and respond to these situations, providing tailored solutions. At the same time, solving non-trivial customer problems often requires access to knowledge bases and contextual customer information, for which AI is particularly well suited. Hence the idea of integrating human and artificial intelligence in a hybrid solution. We developed an AI system to help human assistants in the process of handling conversations. This system can be viewed as a collaborative bot (cobot). The cobot captures the audio stream of the conversation, converts it to text and analyzes it in real time. The extracted tokens are classified and sent to a reasoning system based on a knowledge graph, that provides information and action suggestions to the human assistant. Assistants are also capable of providing information to the reasoning system, utilizing their human understanding of the client's circumstances as they unfold. While designing a prototypical solution for utility services, we have faced the problem of real-time use of computationally complex procedures, including spontaneous speech understanding and knowledge-based heuristic rules. Moreover, we adopted a standards-based approach and experimented with open source reasoners and publicly available language models. The paper outlines the system architecture and design, and discusses the results of the first experiments.},

We have incorporated existing and publicly accessible models into Meiga, a framework designed for the integration of Geant4-based applications. To standardize these simulations, guarantee their reproducibility, and adhere to the FAIR principles, we have developed an extended vocabulary schema using metadata and ontologies that align with current standards. By employing virtualization containers, we capitalize on the scalability and adaptability of public and federated clouds. In this paper, we detail our implementation, present some benchmarking results and comparisons with current methodologies, and discuss the potential applications for evaluating doses on commercial flights or assessing radiation shielding in neutron production facilities.},

Unstructured EHRs derive much of their cost from the substantial amounts of facts that they contain. However, these records are saved in a ramification of formats, making extracting and integrating with other facts resources difficult. Tons of the existing generation for extracting and integrating unstructured facts is confined by scientific understanding, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and the capability to discover sequence editions in the records. For instance, that allows you to correctly pick out patterns in an affected person's health records; NLP algorithms must pick out essential medical concepts in free-text descriptions within the EHRs.

  abstract={Cloud computing is an online service that is provided as services over the internet. Finding and using the services that are available, which is a crucial component for service-oriented applications, is one of the major challenges in cloud computing. This paper ranks service discovery mechanisms into three major classes: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. In order to determine and contrast the usefulness and efficiency of various service discovery techniques for cloud computing's microservices, this comparative study looks at several service discovery strategies. It examines existing research papers and studies in order to compare different approaches used for cloud service discovery.A comparison of these methods shows that the decentralized technique depends on a distributed network while the centralized relies on the central registry and the hybrid is a combination of both approaches. This review paper helps researchers who would like to compare analyses of service discovery mechanisms in cloud computing.},

  abstract={The popularity of the microservices architecture has led to an evident trend of integration in system design, enabling systems to integrate numerous services to meet the diverse requirements of users. However, with extensive integration, it is difficult to quickly identify the root cause of the issues. In this paper, we propose MicroKGCL, a knowledge graph for root cause localization of feedback issues in microservices. Through the knowledge graph constructed with historical cases, MicroKGCL explores the potential relationship between user feedback and the root cause of system issues, it analyzes possible issues and ranks candidate root causes. In detail, in order to provide a more accurate representation of the feedback profile, we design a multi-modal embedding block, which utilizes a contrastive learning model and BERT model to extract feedback features from visual and content modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MicroKGCL in terms of both MRR and Hits@n by comparing with the baselines. Moreover, to further verify the MicroKGCL, it has been deployed in the real production environment of Ant Group, achieving a top-3 hit ratio of 75% and a coverage ratio of 81.8%.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={In recent years, the market of cloud services has been growing rapidly. Consequently, cloud security has become a heavily discussed topic in the industry. If cloud assets are misconfigured, it can lead to severe security issues and be exposured to cybersecurity attacks. It is of great importance that industry practitioners understand the security challenges and their responsibilities to protect cloud assets. We designed a serious game: Cloud of Assets and Threats (CATS) as an enrichment to the traditional training method to empower users of the cloud infrastructure in terms of cloud security awareness. In this work, we propose a new ontology-based model to support the evaluation of the simulated attack scenarios in CATS. We share the implementation details and the algorithm, based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which is used in CATS to evaluate the simulated attack scenarios. With this innovative effort, we maximize the level to which the CATS game reflects real-world facts, and provide a reasonable level of abstraction in the serious game. Our work contributes to the body of knowledge by extending the existing ontology and applying it in the evaluator algorithm, which stands at the core of our serious game CATS. We apply CATS in training in the industry and discovered that CATS is a promising approach to help the industry practitioners to understand cloud security concepts and raise awareness about cloud security. Scholars in the academic world benefit from the work by gaining experience in instantiating the design science paradigm.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={255-267},
  abstract={Modern cloud services are prone to failures due to their complex architecture, making diagnosis a critical process. Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) spend hours leveraging multiple sources of data, including the alerts, error logs, and domain expertise through past experiences to locate the root cause(s). These experiences are documented as natural language text in outage reports for previous outages. However, utilizing the raw yet rich semi-structured information in the reports systematically is time-consuming. Structured information, on the other hand, such as alerts that are often used during fault diagnosis, is voluminous and requires expert knowledge to discern. Several strategies have been proposed to use each source of data separately for root cause analysis. In this work, we build a diagnostic service called ESRO that recommends root causes and remediation for failures by utilizing structured as well as semi-structured sources of data systematically. ESRO constructs a causal graph using alerts and a knowledge graph using outage reports, and merges them in a novel way to form a unified graph during training. A retrieval based mechanism is then used to search the unified graph and rank the likely root causes and remediation techniques based on the alerts fired during an outage at inference time. Not only the individual alerts, but their respective importance in predicting an outage group is taken into account during recommendation. We evaluated our model on several cloud service outages of a large SaaS enterprise over the course of ~2 years, and obtained an average improvement of 27% in rouge scores after comparing the likely root causes against the ground truth over state-of-the-art baselines. We further establish the effectiveness of ESRO through qualitative analysis on multiple real outage examples.},

  abstract={A large volume of cybersecurity-related data sets are generated daily from systems following disparate protocols and standards. It is humanly impossible for cybersecurity experts to manually sieve through these large data sets, with different schema and metadata, to determine potential attacks or issues. A myriad of applications and tool sets are offered to automate the analysis of large cyber data sets. Semantic Web's community has been studying the field of cybersecurity for over a decade and produced numerous knowledge graphs and frameworks. The Unified Cybersecurity Ontology (UCO) connected many of the leading knowledge representation frameworks, providing a holistic mapping of cyber data, beginning in 2016. MITRE ATT&CK is used by a wide variety of practitioners to understand how their current data and tooling prepare them to defend against both Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and less formal threat actors. The UCO and MITRE ATT&CK have provided researchers and practitioners, respectively, with tools to standardize data collection, correlation, and analysis. However, it is not apparent how current knowledge graphs and their applications in the cybersecurity domain utilize ATT&CK. In this paper, we present the results of our study on whether current cybersecurity knowledge graphs have mapped the main MITRE ATT&CK matrices.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={120541-120553},
  abstract={It is difficult for users to understand the complex cloud product information for product selection. Using this information to recommend satisfactory cloud products is a challenge. Previous studies focused on similar information of users and products while neglecting relevance; therefore, they could not create recommendation approaches that account for functional dependencies among cloud products. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a cloud product set recommendation model based on a hierarchical knowledge graph (KG) with a pre-post correlation of product functionality. There are two main contributions: First, we constructed a cloud product functionality and performance KG using the dependency information of layers and entities to represent complicated pre-post logical connections. The KG was designed according to the cloud service model. Second, we designed an improved PageRank algorithm to obtain the importance weight for each functionality and performance, which replaces the original average method with the proportion of connection weight. We considered the release time of the functionality, launch time of the product, and last update time of the product as crucial factors in the recommendation score to reflect the importance of the functionality and current development stage of the product. Finally, our method recommended a product set based on the weighted scores from the above results. In addition, we constructed a cloud product functionality dataset containing 339 functionalities. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate a closely related set of products, leading to improved accuracy and higher satisfaction compared to mainstream methods.},

  abstract={Modern energy grids employ network-enabled sensors, meters, and actuators, controlled via a bidirectional flow of information facilitated by communication and networking infrastructure. The increase in information and communication technologies has, however, rendered smart grids vulnerable to cyberattacks. This position paper presents an ontological model of smart grid systems that elucidates the entities involved and their interrelationships, enabling systematic identification of attack surfaces and vectors. We augment this model by providing an automated method to integrate the vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database – an expanding catalog of over 200,000 cybersecurity vulnerabilities maintained by the MITRE Corporation – to the specified smart grid components in the ontology. By populating the ontology with relevant CVE database entries, we provide an enriched understanding that guides vulnerability assessment and security policy design in smart grid systems. Furthermore, we introduce an automation framework to generate security policies, leveraging the machine-readability of our ontology. This research is expected to promote collaboration among various stakeholders, ranging from developers and operators to regulators, fostering enhanced smart grid security.},

  abstract={Web 3.0 is the promising technology which enables users to read, write, and own user-generated data. It is attracting attentions from academia and industries to based on Web 3.0 construct infrastructures to provide services for participants. Blockchain is a key technology to implement Web 3.0, which can record data and prevent data mutations in a secure and decentralized way. Since Web 3.0 is an integration of multiple technologies, blockchain is required to frequently interact with them, which challenges the throughput of consensus. An efficient consensus algorithm plays an important role to support Web 3.0 infrastructures and services. However, current researches on consensus algorithms require large-scale nodes to participate and switch view frequently, which causes high communication overheads and long consensus delays. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an incentive-based blockchain consensus mechanism for Web 3.0, called CD-PBFT, to improve efficiency and record consensus quality to regulate behaviors of nodes. Since nodes with higher incentives and qualities are selected as the primary nodes frequently to reduce view switching, a cooling mechanism is introduced to prevent these nodes dominating the consensus process. Moreover, a K-medoids-based clustering mechanism is elaborated to form a multi-cluster network to reduce the amount of nodes required for consensus. Simulation results prove that the proposed consensus mechanism can prevent centralization on the primary nodes, and reduce communication overheads and consensus delays.},

  abstract={This research focuses on the limitations of the original association rule and presents a method for addressing these limitations by dividing the dataset into event sequences. The original association rule has a limited ability to identify references related to a keyword, only focusing on the closest ones, which can lead to incomplete and inaccurate results. The proposed method overcomes this limitation by categorizing different types of references based on the research subject, which enables the identification of relevant references that are not immediately adjacent. The reliability of different categories is calculated based on the event table, and candidate records undergo procedures such as aggregation and screening to eliminate less reliable records. The feasibility of this method is evaluated by comparing it with numerous association rule processes in the marketplace. The results show that the proposed method has a significant advantage over other algorithms, with a data correlation rate that remains stable at 80%. Moreover, this study emphasizes the importance of Linked Data technology in publishing and sharing data online. Linked Data provides a lightweight and incremental data transfer model, which makes it an ideal way to integrate resources into the information flow continuously. Libraries can use this technology to become part of the internet's information resources, thereby facilitating the addition and interoperability of further web resources. The development of Semantic Web technologies allows for easier communication between humans and computers, sharing information perception specifications that greatly facilitate communication between the two parties.},

  abstract={Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a challenging subtask in the natural language processing community, which aims to determine the sentiment polarity about the corresponding specific aspect terms. In existing works, external knowledge has been proven effective to improve the ABSA tasks’ performance. However, it is still essential to study further to find a universal method for ABSA tasks. Therefore, we propose an external knowledge-injected graph convolutional network (EKIGCN) to enhance the sentiment representation with commonsense. Specifically, Sentic Net is leveraged to provide external knowledge to construct an affective dependency graph. In order to fully exploit the effectiveness of affective knowledge, a shallow mutual interaction is utilized to fuse the learned contextual representation and the graph. Besides, to make EKIGCN sensitive to aspect terms, an aspect-aware multi-head attention module is also employed to enhance the corresponding relations between aspect and contextual words. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, and the results outperform the mentioned state-of-the-art methods in ABSA tasks.},

  abstract={The Digital Twin (DT) provides a digital representation of a physical system and allows users to interactively study the physical processes of a real system via the digital representation in different scenarios in real time. The development of a DT is highly complex; it requires not only expertise from multiple disciplines but also the integration of often heterogeneous software components, e.g., simulations, machine learning, visualization, and user interface components across distributed environments. This poster presents a Knowledge Graph-based ontological framework to boost automation and collaboration during the DT lifecycle stages. We implement our methods in developing a what-if analysis service for a DT of an ecosystem of wetlands and its automated deployment to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.},

  abstract={Cloud manufacturing provides a new concept and model for manufacturing informatization. However, it still faces many challenges, especially in the matching of service resources and service requirements in reconfigurable production line. In this article, we propose a service description language based on extended OWL-S (Ontology Web Language for Services) to encapsulate geographically dispersed and formally heterogeneous manufacturing resources into cloud services. We also propose a Semantic-based service matching approach using BTM (Biterm Topic Model Technology) and Gibbs sampling algorithm. This approach performs service screening through topic similarity matching and parameter array similarity matching, and recommends the most suitable service set for cloud service users, providing a new method for resource matching in the reconfigurable production line resources. Finally, through an example of service encapsulation and matching, we verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed service encapsulation method and service matching algorithm.},

  pages={194-199},
  abstract={Knowledge graph is a data structure with strong expression ability, which has been widely used in both academic and production fields, but most of existing knowledge graphs suffer from incompleteness, various methods like ConvE, Hyper and InteraceE have been proposed to tackle with this problem. Combining with hyper-network-based convolution and linear transformation of entities, a knowledge graph completion method named HyperL is proposed in this paper, HyperL not only inherits the excellent information fusion and expression ability of convolution transformation, but also enhanced the expression ability of entities with linear transformation. The proposed method is evaluated on three standard datasets including FB15k-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10, and the performances are compared with other benchmark methods. Experimental results shows that the MRR of HyperL on FB15k-237, WN18RR and YAG03 can reach 0.360, 0.468, 0.552, respectively, which indicate that HyperL is and effective knowledge graph completion method.},

  abstract={Discontinuous data is a kind of large-scale hierarchical data. Generally speaking, this kind of data has time attribute, and it hopes to show some time-varying characteristics on the basis of keeping the hierarchical structure clear. Using path mining to analyze discontinuous data paths in cloud computing environment, we can find the location and data state of discontinuous data paths. Classifying and counting discontinuous data is beneficial to the efficient use of data. In this paper, the optimization of discontinuous data path mining based on fuzzy clustering algorithm is studied. In order to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, this paper extracts the semantic directional features of discontinuous data and quantifies them. On the basis of quantization coding, FCM (fuzzy C means) algorithm is adopted to realize the directional beam clustering of semantic ontology features and improve the path mining algorithm. The research results show that the proposed algorithm is used to optimize the path mining of discontinuous data based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, and the root mean square error of the path mining output is low, which shows that the path mining accuracy is higher than the traditional method and the anti-interference performance is strong.},

  abstract={Virtual and augmented reality are currently enjoying a great deal of attention from the research community and the industry towards their adoption within industrial spaces and processes. However, the current design and implementation landscape is still very fluid, while the community as a whole has not yet consolidated into concrete design directions, other than basic patterns. Other open issues include the choice over a cloud or edge-based architecture when designing such systems. Within this work, we present our approach for a monitoring intervention inside a factory space utilizing both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), based primarily on edge computing, while also utilizing the cloud. We discuss its main design directions, as well as a basic ontology to aid in simple description of factory assets. In order to highlight the design aspects of our approach, we present a prototype implementation, based on a use case scenario in a factory site, within the context of the EnerMan H2020 project.},

  abstract={The information available today is scattered everywhere. The traditional method of learning which is completely text-based takes more time to understand. Students must learn more in less time and also have good knowledge of the concepts which are not only present in the textbooks, but also from external sources. Visual learning techniques are the most well-known effective way to learn more information in less time. When information is presented visually, it is easy to understand the concepts and remember them for a long time. The knowledge graph is used to represent the information with the relationship between the different topics in a visually comprehensive manner. Our project aims in helping students to learn visually with the help of knowledge graphs (or concept maps). The Graphs for various subjects will be available separately and can be used by students to learn interactively. Our project is mainly focused on subjects from the computer science domain. For the knowledge graph construction, the required data is scraped from the internet using Wikipedia and Google Knowledge APIs. Natural language processing (NLP) is used to process scrapped data from the internet which is then processed using a graph database to display the knowledge graph with the data and the relationship connecting the data. All graphs are made in such a way to make a visual impact on learners such that it is easy to read and interpret.},

  abstract={To better carry out early warning and control work for high-risk individuals in society, this paper proposes a risk assessment model based on graph attention networks. The model analyzes relevant background and relationship information of these individuals and constructs a knowledge graph accordingly. An improved graph attention mechanism is introduced to establish the risk assessment model. Real police character data was used to train and test the model, and experimental results indicated a prediction accuracy of 89.4%, with both accuracy and recall rates around 90%. This model can provide decision-making basis and technical support for early warning of public security personnel by identifying potential risks of high-risk individuals.},
