  abstract={In recent years, service-oriented computing, as a new computing paradigm, has been developed rapidly. Following this trend, more and more Web services and cloud services have been developed and made publicly available on the Web. These publicly available services will be important components for service-oriented system construction. However, these large numbers of services increase the burden of service selection in service-oriented system construction. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network-based service matchmaking approach to match services according to developer requests in service-oriented system construction. In the model, the convolutional neural network aims to learn the semantic feature representation for matchmaking. We experimented on a real-world dataset, ProgammableWeb.com, and experiment results show that the proposed approach can help find relevant services according to developer requests.},

  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={130797-130819},
  abstract={In most Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) systems, Design Resource (DR) is encapsulated into cloud service under a fine-grained condition. However, due to the small granularity of DRs provided by cloud provider, it is difficult for the cloud services to match with design tasks if there is no initiative resource. For example, because of the lack of initiative perception capabilities, it is difficult for design software to match with design tasks directly. A method of DR multi-granularity modeling with two-stage aggregation is proposed, by which the resource granularity is increased and dynamic design capability is formed. In the proposed DR multi-granularity model, DRs are classified into three granularities: Static Physical Resource (SPR), Dynamic Capacity Resource (DCR), and Cross-functional Design Unit (CDU). Their ontology models are set up to represent the basic function, structure and component of DRs. In the two-stage aggregation of DRs, two strategies are proposed to increase the granularity of DRs. The first is DCR aggregation strategy based on auxiliary resources actively pushing, and the second is CDU aggregation strategy based on meta task and meta capability matching. Using the operation parameters of DRs and the associated evaluation matrix, a method of DCR and CDU evaluation is proposed to optimize the searched DRs. With the help of the preceding multi-granularity DR modeling and the two-stage access strategy, DR granularity is enlarged and initiative design capability is formed, which solves the problem of DRs matching with design tasks because of small resource granularity.},

  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={148541-148555},
  abstract={To address data protection concerns, authorities and standards bodies worldwide have released a plethora of regulations, guidelines, and software controls to be applied to Cloud data. As a result, service providers maintaining their end-user's private attributes have seen a surge in compliance requirements. Since most of these regulations are not available in a machine-processable format, it requires significant manual effort to adhere to them. Often many of the laws have overlapping rules, but as they are not referencing each other, providers must duplicate efforts to comply with each regulation. We have done a detailed study of all the data protection regulations that apply to Cloud data. We have developed an integrated, semantically rich knowledge graph that captures these various data compliance regulations. It includes the data threats and security controls that are needed to mitigate the risks. In this paper, we present this knowledge graph in detail, along with the system that we have developed to evaluate it. We have validated our knowledge graph against the privacy policies of various Cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, IBM, and Rackspace. This knowledge graph is available in the public domain and can be used by organizations to automate their compliance processes and set their enterprise Cloud security policies.},

  volume={25},

  pages={798-812},
  abstract={Semantic Service Matchmaking (SSM) can be leveraged for mining the most suitable service to accommodate a diversity of user demands. However, existing research on SSM mostly involves logical or non-logical matching, leading to unavoidable false-positive and false-negative problems. Combining different types of SSM methods is an effective way to improve this situation, but the adaptive combination of different service matching methods is still a difficult issue. To conquer this difficulty, a hybrid SSM method, which is based on a random forest and combines the advantages of existing SSM methods, is proposed in this paper. The result of each SSM method is treated as a multi-dimensional feature vector input for the random forest, converting the service matching into a two classification problem. Therefore, our method avoids the flaws found in manual threshold setting. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an outstanding performance.},

  pages={43898-43907},
  abstract={An ontology can formally present the domain knowledge by specifying the domain concepts and their relationships, which is a kernel technique for addressing the data heterogeneity issue in the semantic web. However, since existing ontologies are developed and maintained independently by different communities, a concept and its relationship with the others could be described in different ways, yielding the ontology heterogeneity problem. To solve this problem, in this work, we formally construct an optimal model for it, and propose a similarity measure for distinguishing identical ontology entities. Since determining the high-quality ontology alignment is a complex process, we propose to utilize a Brain Storm Optimization algorithm (BSO) to optimize the alignment. BSO is a recently developed Swarm Intelligence algorithm (SI), which can effectively solve the complex optimization problem by imitating the human's idea generating process. However, classic BSO needs to cluster various ideas in each generation and carry out the evolving operators on all ideas, which increases the computational complexity. To improve the efficiency of BSO-based ontology matcher, a Compact BSO (CBSO) is further proposed, which can reduce the memory consumption by utilizing the probabilistic representation on the idea cluster, and improve the algorithm's speed through the compact crossover operator and perturbation operator. The experiment uses the benchmark track provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) to test our approach's performance. The comparisons among the state-of-the-art ontology matchers and our proposal show that CBSO-based ontology matcher can efficiently determine high-quality ontology alignments.},

  abstract={IP prefix hijacking continues to be a pervasive cyber security threat to the core internet routing infrastructure. The data security of multiple cloud-based services is also susceptible to these threats, due to the high dependency on traditional routing protocols. Although a number of hijacking detection techniques have been recently proposed, no existing system has effectively addressed the problem of detecting malicious transit Autonomous System (AS) services in any detected hijacking occurrences. The ability to locate and isolate malicious services is critical for conducting a necessary mitigation strategy at an early stage, to minimise the impact of the attack, to restore cloud services quickly. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time processing method, so-called Ontological Graph Identification (OGI), for detecting IP prefix hijacking of nodes and suspicious transit nodes caused by the hijacked nodes through ASs. The proposed method is evaluated using the two public datasets of RIPE RIS and RouteView. Experimental results revealed improved performance for the detection of malicious transit nodes compared with peer techniques. It is, therefore, shown that the proposed method has utility in automating the process of investigating nodes with suspicious activities in real network systems.},

Effectively integrating multi-level mental health big data and providing multi-level and content-oriented data services for different types of users by an open and extendable mode becomes new requirements on the acquisition and computing of mental health big data. The existing Data-Brain-based brain data center cannot meet these new requirements.

  abstract={Cloud computing involves multiple stakeholders, each with its own security, privacy and trust requirements, where policy enforcement is shared between the various stakeholders, in contrast to on-premise computing, where an organizations policies are enforced using internal resources. To effectively manage and integrate security requirements in the cloud, the provider and customer needs to negotiate and agree upon the applied security policies. However, there is no standard way of expressing cloud security policies in a vendor-agnostic manner. Cloud security and privacy policies are often stated in an informal and ad-hoc manner, which leads to policy conflicts, incompleteness, ambiguity and inconsistencies. In this paper, we present CERBERUS, a framework for representing cloud security and privacy policies and detecting potential problems in the policies. CERBERUS adopts an object-oriented approach and consists of an ontology and notation, policies, guidelines and rules, and a tool for capturing and detecting policy errors. Using CERBERUS, policies can be analyzed for potential problems, including policy conflicts, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness. An application of CERBERUS shows that it indeed helps to discover policy errors, which otherwise would go undetected or in many cases would be detected a posteriori at runtime.},

  abstract={Ontologies play an important role across several domains as they represent and define categories, properties and relationships among concepts, data and entities existing in those domains. Specially in Robotics, ontologies can be used as a standard way to represent and share knowledge and reasoning among autonomous agents. CORA (core ontology or robotics and automation) is a standard ontology developed by the IEEE ORA working group mapping main concepts and axioms from the robotics and automation (R&A) domain. After CORA has been approved as an official IEEE standard, ORA was split in different sub-groups addressing, among other topics, task representation (RTR) and autonomous robots architectures (AuR). This paper presents a simulation study on a multirobot reconnaissance application intended to serve as proof-ofconcept on the feasibility of the CORA ontology and its related architecture. We show how robots and tasks are represented and dynamically mapped into the ontology, as well discuss some technical aspects of our simulation when dealing with the proposed architecture. Our results show the proposed ontology (CORA) and its associated reference architecture (ROA) are able to be correctly mapped during application runtime.},

  abstract={Stream Processing (SP) is an important Big Data technology enabling continuous querying of data streams. The stream setting offers the opportunity to exploit synergies and, theoretically, share the access and processing costs between multiple different collaborators. But what should be the monetary contribution of each consumer when they do not trust each other and have varying valuations of the differing outcomes? In this article, we present Collaborative Stream Processing (CSP), a model where the costs, which are set exogenously by providers, are shared between multiple consumers, the collaborators. For this, we identify three important requirements for CSP to establish trust between the collaborators and propose a CSP algorithm, ENCSPA, adhering to these requirements. Based on the collaborators' outcome valuations and the costs of the raw data streams, ENCSPA computes the payment for each collaborator. At the same time, ENCSPA ensures that no collaborator has an incentive to manipulate the system by providing misinformation about her/his value, budget, or time limit. We show that ENCSPA can calculate payments in a reasonable amount of time for up to one thousand collaborators.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is witnessing a fast development and widespread adoption from small to large organizations due to its cost-effective and resource-efficient services. Nevertheless, security risks remain major concerns. One of the main challenges is how to evaluate the security level of cloud services. Among the problems arising are the large variety of knowledge associated with the security domain and the heterogeneity of cloud services descriptions. An effective solution to such problems is ontologies. Ontologies provide a more structured and formal representation of a particular domain, which will help to reduce the conceptual ambiguity and enable automatic reasoning functionalities. In this paper, we propose an ontology for cloud services security evaluation based on industry standards and best practices. Some of the core concepts included in the ontology are the target, criteria, yardstick, data gathering techniques and data synthesis approaches. The concepts are grouped into five general categories, namely: context, assumptions, external factors, activities, and outcomes. The ontology is implemented using Protégé tool and validated through different uses case scenarios.},

  abstract={Cloud computing has emerged as real world technology over the Internet. Due to the development of big data with high dimensionality, data storage possibility over cloud has created large scope in recent times. Document clustering is the fundamental topic that turned into an indispensable component in many areas like cloud computing. Document clustering partitions the document into significant classes or groups for retrieving the relevant document. Many researchers used the factorization methods and ontologies for internal and external knowledge based document clustering. However, existing methods failed to provide the semantic feature construction and leads to the information loss while covering all the ideas in documents. In order to address these problems, different document clustering techniques in cloud has been reviewed in this paper. In addition to that Document clustering by Entropy-based Boosting with Projection Neural Feature (EB-PNF) method is presented. The proposed method involves two stages. They are, similar document identification based on semantic similarity score, feature extraction which includes the extraction of both single and multi-label features based on the precision, recall and computational complexity to prove that EB-PNF method produces high-quality clusters comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={The development of Cloud computing led to an increase in the number of services ready for use and therefore the number of consumers' requests. Cloud providers advertise the description of their offered services in different formats on the Internet. This makes the discovery and selection of services more difficult for users. Thus, a uniform description of Cloud services would be needed. The aim of this study is to provide a new ontology for uniform description of Cloud services coming from heterogeneous sources. The proposed model takes into account the different relationships and dependencies between services across Cloud's layers. These dependencies are represented by the different constraints of composition and deployment. To validate our proposal, qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted. The qualitative evaluation is carried out by making comparisons with both state-of-the-art works and the Bitnami platform according to some criteria. For the quantitative evaluation, comparisons are performed with the output results specified by users. Globally, the results are promising and encouraging.},

  abstract={Cloud Manufacturing (CM) offers the possibility to use and provide production services within an as-a-service concept. The CM paradigm enables more efficient resource utilization in the context of industry 4.0 through fully automated order processing. Existing architecture solutions, however, follow a central platform approach with a global neutral data model. As a consequence, the individuality of companies within the CM is not given any room for expression and symbioses between companies are not established. The result is a disadvantage particularly for SMEs, which generate their competitive advantage from innovative production technologies and symbiotic connections with customers and other SMEs. The focus of Collective Cloud Manufacturing (CCM) is the preservation of these characteristics, in which an over-approximation of costs through the integration of production-related simulations is to be reduced and the data security of the customer is to be enhanced. So in this work, a data model for an existing concept for CCM is presented. The requirements for the data model and the runtime behavior are defined. Subsequently, the state of the art of existing models in the domain of CM is presented. The developed data model is presented with an application evaluation.},

  abstract={As an advanced manufacturing model, cloud manufacturing(CMfg) has made great progress in recent years. The concept of CMfg has been introduced to many industries. With the growing diversity of products, the complexity of cloud manufacturing service encapsulation is also increasing. To solve the problem of product-oriented service standardized encapsulation, the Bills of Standard Manufacturing Service(BOSS) has been proposed. It can systematically solve the problem of deployment, registration and management of cloud manufacturing services in the whole product life cycle. In this paper, based on the service ontology model, we proposed an automatic perfecting service information method of BOSS using the focused crawler technology. Combined with the case study, we verified the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. Finally, the application framework of BOSS in the cloud manufacturing system is further discussed.},

  abstract={Digital Transformation (DT) has a direct impact on relations and forms of consumption. New technologies are being incorporated continuously into our day-to-day life, introducing new shapes for traditional and original kinds of businesses. Nevertheless, it is interesting to notice that most novelty is based mainly on processes, rather than on technology. A DT initiative should start with conceptual modeling to organize and structure knowledge of its scope. However, there is not a specific proper language to model DT initiatives. Based on an extensive literature review, we propose an Ontology - the DI-BPM-Onto - with this purpose. The ontology proposed conceptualizes three aspects: Digital Transformation and Innovation (DT&I), Business Process Management Contextual Factors, and Digital Technology, which are independent layers, but orthogonally related. On the other side, modeling tools like the well-known standard ArchiMate are widely used by companies to provide an unambiguous understanding of their businesses, and already support the description, analysis, and visualization of most enterprise architecture (EA) elements. Therefore, in this paper, to better model DT initiatives, we propose a Reference Model that extending the ArchiMate with the main concepts of DT identified in the DI-BPM-Onto to better model DT&I initiatives and to discuss to what extent ArchiMate would support the implementation of DT&I initiatives. A practical modelling scenario concerning UBER is used to carry out a preliminary evaluation of the proposal.},

  abstract={With the popularity of cloud and edge computing, various types of service level agreement (SLA) are used to enforce the amount of resources that service providers commit to end users. However, the security SLAs (SSLA) are usually hard to verify since their execution results are related to the intensity and frequency of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the proof of encryption problem. Restricted by available resources and hardware capabilities, some end users need to outsource the strong encryption operations of data to external service providers. Verification of the correct execution of encryption is a problem since it is directly related to data safety. We first define the expected properties of the Proof of Encryption (PoE) mechanisms. We propose two mechanisms based on whether or not the service requester is aware of the encryption key. They allow an end user to verify that corresponding encryption algorithm and key strength are honored. We describe the details of the verification procedures. Simulation and experiments show that our approaches can detect a dishonest service provider with high probability.},

In this paper, a framework for constructing a data acquisition system with integrated robotic technology components and modern web-based technologies is presented. Our proposed framework enables developers to construct a robot environment with data acquisition functionalities by defining scenarios in an ontology language. The framework is realized in such a way that allows it to automatically generate the required software components and their corresponding repositories, which are deployed on the cloud. A case study showcasing the proposed framework is also demonstrated.},

  abstract={High-performance computing (HPC) has played a significant role in scientific discovery and technological innovation, but resources distributed in cross-regional supercomputing centers are still used inefficiently and hard to be managed uniformly, due to various challenging issues like the complex resource types, the heterogeneous interfaces of the resource management software, the inefficient coordination of software and hardware, and the lack of available and standardized description specification model. In this paper, we first propose a HPC resource ontology model called HPCRO to define the concepts of hardware resources and software resources, and specifies types, attributes, logical relations, and data transfer among resources. Moreover, based on the proposed model, we further propose a method called WordNet-based Quick Resource Index List (WQRIL) to support efficient HPC resources discovery. Specifically, the method extends and optimizes the existing method with Quick Service Quick List (QSQL) by extracting synonyms of ontology concepts from WordNet. The method not only can provide a unified representation of HPC resources, but also can support semantic-based fuzzy matching. More importantly, it improves the usability and utilization of hardware and software resources effectively in cross-regional high-performance computing centers. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposals.},

  abstract={A cloud service marketplace is the first point for a consumer to discovery, select and possible composition of different services. Although there are some private cloud service marketplaces, such as Microsoft Azure, that allow consumers to search service advertainment belonging to a given vendor. However, due to an increase in the number of cloud service advertisement, a consumer needs to find related services across the worldwide web (WWW). A consumer mostly uses a search engine such as Google, Bing, for the service advertisement discovery. However, these search engines are insufficient in retrieving related cloud services advertainments on time. There is a need for a framework that effectively and efficiently discovery of the related service advertisement for ordinary users. This paper addresses the issue by proposing a user-friendly harvester and a centralised cloud service repository framework. The proposed Centralised Cloud Service Repository (CCSR) framework has two modules - Harvesting as-a-Service (HaaS) and the service repository module. The HaaS module allows users to extract real-time data from the web and make it available to different file format without the need to write any code. The service repository module provides a centralised cloud service repository that enables a consumer for efficient and effective cloud service discovery. We validate and demonstrate the suitability of our framework by comparing its efficiency and feasibility with three widely used open-source harvesters. From the evaluative result, we observe that when we harvest a large number of services advertisements, the HaaS is more efficient compared with the traditional harvesting tools. Our cloud services advertisements dataset is publicly available for future research at: http://cloudmarketregistry.com/cloud-market-registry/home.html},

  abstract={With the rapid adoption of Cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, health providers are particularly concerned about managing data privacy on the cloud. Existing approaches have either a scalability bottleneck by requiring that patients approve each sharing of their medical data or a trust bottleneck by having a single authority control every access thereby creating the problem of a single point of attack. To address both these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that enables policy based multi-authority access authorization to EHR systems accessed by multiple care providers from different locations or organizations. This framework, which resides on the Edge, has been built using the Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA-ABE) and Semantic Web technologies to provide a secure, semantically rich approach to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations who manage different attributes of end users using a shared dataset. In this paper, we describe our novel approach along with the proof of concept prototype that we created to evaluate our framework.},

  abstract={In the area of production, individual domains are growing more and more closely together. Producing value-added chains and complex supply chains is becoming increasingly intertwined in the process of production planning. The exchange of data between the involved partners plays a critical role. The needs of the customer, the current order situation of the supplier as well as the manufacturing process dependencies of the manufacturer must be coordinated in a symbiotic manner to achieve efficient production. Therefore, this paper presents a variant of cloud manufacturing, collective cloud manufacturing, which focuses on the formation of cross-company symbioses to exchange production information in an environment isolated for data protection via an evolutionary needs model. For this purpose, a previously presented concept and the challenges of industry strategies are described to show how the concept of collective cloud manufacturing can meet the requirements of digitalization.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0, which exploits cyber-physical systems and represents digital transformation of manufacturing, is deeply affecting healthcare as well as other traditional production sector. To accommodate the increasing demand of agility, flexibility, and low cost in healthcare sector, a data-driven reconfigurable production mode of Smart Factory for pharmaceutical manufacturing is proposed in this paper. The architecture of the Smart Factory is consisted of three primary layers, namely perception layer, deployment layer, and executing layer. A Manufacturing's Semantics Ontology based knowledgebase is introduced in the perception layer, which is responsible for plan scheduling of pharmaceutical production. The reconfigurable plans are generated from the production demand of drugs as well as the information statement of low-level machine resources. To further functionality reconfiguration and low-level controlling, the IEC 61499 standard is also introduced for functionality modeling and machine controlling. We verify the proposed method with an experiment of demand-based drug packing production, which reflects the feasibility and adequate flexibility of the proposed method.},

  title={Mobile Cloud Support for Semantic-Enriched Speech Recognition in Social Care},

  pages={259-272},
  abstract={Nowadays, most users carry high computing power mobile devices where speech recognition is certainly one of the main technologies available in every modern smartphone, although battery draining and application performance (resource shortage) have a big impact on the experienced quality. Shifting applications and services to the cloud may help to improve mobile user satisfaction as demonstrated by several ongoing efforts in the mobile cloud area. However, the quality of speech recognition is still not sufficient in many complex cases to replace the common hand written text, especially when prompt reaction to short-term provisioning requests is required. To address the new scenario, this paper proposes a mobile cloud infrastructure to support the extraction of semantics information from speech recognition in the Social Care domain, where carers have to speak about their patients conditions in order to have reliable notes used afterward to plan the best support. We present not only an architecture proposal, but also a real prototype that we have deployed and thoroughly assessed with different queries, accents, and in presence of load peaks, in our experimental mobile cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) testbed based on Cloud Foundry.},

  abstract={This paper deals with the development of advanced tools and technologies for creating relevant information and suitable metadata out of textual documentation produced by Italian archaeological research. A set of Natural Language Processing tools were developed to recognize and annotate various archaeological entities in Italian language textual reports. The CIDOC CRM is the ontology chosen for encoding resulting output, allowing for a maximum degree of standardisation of the produced metadata to guarantee interoperability with archaeological information already existing in other semantically enabled digital archives. The work took place as part of the development for the TEXTCROWD platform for the European Open Science Cloud for Research Pilot Project.},

  abstract={This paper proposed a scheme that automatically converts service rules of cloud manufacturing to semantic rules. The scheme classifies the semantics of typical service rules into several semantic categories. Sentence embedding is used to represent the semantics of service rules. A logistic regression classifier is used to identify the semantic category of a service rule according to its sentence embedding. Based on the identified semantic category, the service rule is converted to a semantic rule. The evaluation of the scheme shows that the scheme achieves good conversion accuracy.},

  abstract={Cloud computing offers attractive options to migrate corporate applications without the end users needing to manage any physical resources. While this "ease" is appealing, several issues arise: 1) Which Cloud Providers (CPs) offer the best infrastructure at a fair budget? 2) I am no Cloud expert, then what are the characteristics of the infrastructure which best fit my application? To answer these questions, one must solve a resource management problem, that is, the allocation of computing, storage, networking and (indirectly) cost resources to a set of applications such that the performance objectives of the application are fulfilled. There are many approaches which answer separately these questions but there is no comprehensive and easily usable solution for these issues. MANeUveR solves them by integrating the following components: 1) a Web User Interface offers the end user the possibility to describe his application in terms of interactions between components and their software and hardware requirements, 2) an Offers Management System, through a crawler, periodically updates an ontology with infrastructure and services details from different CPs, 3) a Recommendation Engine provides a (sub) optimal solution for application deployment in the CP infrastructure regarding the leasing price of the virtual machines needed for deployment and their characteristics. Using a secure-billing e-mail service, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.},

  abstract={Cloud computing offers wide variety of utility oriented services from different service providers. With the advent of cloud, users can avail the required services even without owning the infrastructure. However, the selection of required services from the available service provider is always a challenging task. In this paper, we attempt to introduce an intelligent cloud broker for simplifying the cloud service selection process. Also, the paper presents a comprehensive survey of research work in the phase of cloud service selection. Various research attempts have been discussed elaborately along with their limitations for further exploration. Finally, the paper emphasizes the need for the cloud broker in service selection phase. The novel idea has been strengthened by introducing an intelligent cloud broker for the existing cloud architecture to perform the effective selection and delivery of required services.},

  abstract={For decades, researchers and practitioners develop various approaches such as Web Service technologies (e.g., UDDI, WSDL, SOAP) to address application integration problems. In particular, Web Service composition methods can solve complex service integrations. However, in highly dynamic environments, these manual service compositions still requires a lot of effort. To address this challenge, researchers have recently introduced semantic web service composition methods. The growing interest in this topic of semantic web service composition has led to an increasing number of approaches, which has not been systematically surveyed so far. Researchers have reported several surveys in the related areas such as web service composition or semantic web service search. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provides a survey about these semantic web service compositions in particular. Hence, this review aims to address this issue by identifying existing efforts on semantic web service compositions. The survey focuses on two aspects (i) semantic web service description, as it is an essential aspect for semantic service composition, (ii) semantic web service composition, to identify methods and their implementations on the real world problem.},

  abstract={In cloud manufacturing (CMfg) environment, more and more manufacturing enterprises outsource many manufacturing activities to more professional subcontractor and focus on their core business. To address outsourcing resource (OR) combinatorial optimization for cement equipment manufacturing enterprise and reduce cost, a novel multi-objective optimization model and heuristic approach are investigated in this study. A matrix model based on ontology for outsourcing resource optimization is established. Then, an improved self-adaptive genetic algorithm (SEGA) has been developed. Finally, a case study and comparison of performances with simple genetic algorithm (SGA) and SEGA are presented. Experimental results show the proposed method is more preferably and efficient in optimal solution searching.},

  abstract={In this paper we evaluate the performance of question generation using contextual reasoning in dialogs generated from an Ontology to provide identification, authentication, and access control. Generating relevant questions requires frequent querying after each question, using its context to generate the next one. This process is tedious and might lead to a situation where the interviewee has to wait for a question for an unacceptably long time. The objective of this work is to show that our method for generation of questions using context does not cause delays that might turn the dialogs useless.},

  pages={73-80},
  abstract={The serverless computing paradigm brings multiple benefits to application developers who are interested in consuming computing resources as services without the need to manage physical capacities or limits. There are several deployment technologies and languages available suitable for deploying applications to a single cloud provider. However, for multi-cloud application deployments, multiple technologies have to be used and orchestrated. In addition, the event-driven nature of serverless computing imposes further requirements on modeling such application structures in order to automate their deployment. In this paper, we tackle these issues by introducing an event-driven deployment modeling approach using the standard Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) that fully employs the suggested standard lifecycle to provision and manage multi-cloud serverless applications. To show the feasibility of our approach, we extended the existing TOSCA-based ecosystem OpenTOSCA.},

  abstract={In the last decade the number of cloud services has grown significantly, and its nature challenges the traditional process of requirements elicitation for software solutions. Most of the conducted cloud research address non-functional requirements, such as payment strategies, performance or security. Methods are required which provide an appropriate level of abstraction for describing the functional aspects of cloud services. We suggest an approach which exploits the potential of enterprise architecture modeling for cloud service selection. This study contributes to cloud service selection in two ways. First, we suggest a concept for the description of functional requirements for vertical SaaS services. Second, we provide a method that enables various kinds of stakeholders to describe their requirements considering their individual knowledge level.},

  abstract={Nowadays, Cloud Computing has emerged as a new model for hosting, managing and delivering services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) over the Internet. Enterprises and vendors are continuously migrating their services to the Cloud, this resulted an exponential amount of data, services and resources stored in data centers. Since there is no standard about Cloud service description or publication, therefore a key requirement that every Cloud provider needs to take into consideration is efficient management of resources and services by providing automated solutions, for a better service publication and discovery. The proposed approach aims to manage Cloud SaaS services for an efficient publication by classifying them into sets according to their domain to reduce the search space then interconnected the SaaS services of the same domain in a Semantic Network using the similarity measure (Input/Output similarity) between concepts. The proposed solution takes advantages from multidimensional index framework, WordNet Domain Ontology and semantic Web. A guided publication process and an implemented prototype are introduced validating the system using a real data set corpus.},

According the algorithm, memory antibody collection in which characteristics of service are condensed is abstracted, and each service (antigen) that belongs to some type is also obtained. Using membership matrix and a hundred-mark way, evaluation result which reflects Web quality of service is obtain. The prototype is designed. It is applied to case evaluation fruitfully, and the experiment results are veracious and reliable as well as stable.},

  abstract={Semantic Annotation is the main activity for the semantic web, but it has been faced with many challenges which has hindered its growth as initially expected. While several tools exist for providing semantic annotation to web documents, the techniques used in these tools vary very widely. Also, the mode of implementation and the solutions offered by the tools are inconsistent with each other leaving end users confused on the appropriate tool for use to deliver their expected results. Based on these, a holistic perspective to the development of semantic annotation tools as well as their implementation is necessary. This is to ensure uniformity in the expected end results and guarantee a continuous, dynamic and consistent semantic annotation for web documents; encompassing the complete needs of end users. To achieve this, cloud computing is proposed for the delivery of semantic annotation as a holistic service, as it provides an enabling environment for processing the vast amount of data required to annotate web documents. Also, cloud computing essential characteristics such as ubiquitous network access, rapid elasticity and on-demand self-service are very necessary to achieve a holistic semantic annotation service for documents on the web. This paper presents a cloud-driven framework to facilitate the delivery of a holistic semantic annotation on the web.},

  abstract={In an open source cloud computing platform such as OpenStack, operators use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model to grant access to cloud resources. However, these user-level role-based access control techniques fail to include comprehensive user context. We believe a situational aware framework will improve security by bringing in user's context to such cloud systems. In this paper, we create a semantically rich context-sensitive access control system for OpenStack by incorporating the user's current context attributes like location, time, etc. In a proof-of-concept implementation, we integrate a knowledge graph with our own access control system to express and enforce the contextual-situation policies in OpenStack. The proposed system provides enhanced, flexible access control while minimizing the overhead of altering the existing access control framework. We also discuss various use cases, to highlight the benefits of our system and show enforcement results.},

  abstract={Integrating data analysis into workflows is a recent tendency in manufacturing sectors. According to the vision of Industry 4.0, data analysis can be automatically performed at any point of workflows if needed. In distributed and complex manufacturing systems, checking the integrity of data analysis processes is becoming more and more challenging and the dependency between (intermediate) analysis results is no more easy to understand for users involved in workflows. Therefore, a mechanism is desired, which is able to assist users in tracking and verifying distributed data analysis processes. In this paper, we extend the concept “data provenance” in the manufacturing domain to acquire information about the data origin and data changes. Furthermore, an architecture is proposed to manage provenance of process data, in which the data provenance is considered as annotation of process data. Different use cases are also given to show how data provenance can have impact on understanding and verifying data analysis processes in the manufacturing domain.},

  abstract={Cloud cyber-physical systems are the natural evolution of embedded systems based on trends which may be observed in various domains. Cloud-based systems may be understood as a transformation of legacy system hardware and software architecture into more flexible, robust, powerful, and reliable solution. Cloud cyber-physical system (CPS) is the extension of the well-known CPS concept where complex computations may be moved to a cloud platform. We proposed the solution which benefits from utilization of OPC UA standard. This standard provides rich expressivity for data model design as well as for secure communication, data subscription, and triggering methods. The overall approach is demonstrated on proposed and implemented Semantic Big Data Historian which forms together with a cyber-physical system the implementation of cloud CPS concept.},

  abstract={This paper describes a framework called MaestROBe It is designed to make the robots perform complex tasks with high precision by simple high-level instructions given by natural language or demonstration. To realize this, it handles a hierarchical structure by using the knowledge stored in the forms of ontology and rules for bridging among different levels of instructions. Accordingly, the framework has multiple layers of processing components; perception and actuation control at the low level, symbolic planner and Watson APIs for cognitive capabilities and semantic understanding, and orchestration of these components by a new open source robot middleware called Project Intu at its core. We show how this framework can be used in a complex scenario where multiple actors (human, a communication robot, and an industrial robot) collaborate to perform a common industrial task. Human teaches an assembly task to Pepper (a humanoid robot from SoftBank Robotics) using natural language conversation and demonstration. Our framework helps Pepper perceive the human demonstration and generate a sequence of actions for UR5 (collaborative robot arm from Universal Robots), which ultimately performs the assembly (e.g. insertion) task.},

  pages={932-935},
  abstract={Medical organizations find it challenging to adopt cloud-based electronic medical records services, due to the risk of data breaches and the resulting compromise of patient data. Existing authorization models follow a patient centric approach for EHR management where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients' end. This however creates a significant overhead for the patient who has to authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given the multiple personnel involved in providing care and that at times the patient may not be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need of developing a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy cloud-based EHR management. We have developed a novel, centralized, attribute based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based EHR's access authority to the medical providers. In this paper, we describe this novel ABE approach as well as the prototype system that we have created to illustrate it.},

  abstract={Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) requires an infrastructure that is combining the capabilities of resource-constrained but mobile and context-aware devices with that of immovable but powerful resources in the cloud. Application execution shall be boosted and battery consumption reduced. Our goal is to relieve mobile devices by enabling applications to cooperate transparently with components provided by third parties remotely, locally, or both. For this purpose, we developed SAM - the Semantic-aware Middleware - and the SAM Store. The latter resembles a registry. It allows component providers to publish semantically enriched interfaces and to offer corresponding local and remote implementations. SAM makes use of the SAM Store to match local interprocess communication (IPC) messages transparently against local and remote components. This architecture facilitates the integration of powerful, but resource-intensive remote components, which may be prioritized over local ones, and fosters various patterns of cooperation that demonstrate useful solutions in the area of MCC. By means of a realistic scenario, our evaluation proves the efficiency with respect to latency and practicality.},

It has become the current focus on how to find a service to meet their needs in cloud market. However in cloud market, the difficult is that how to maximize the benefit of users and make users understand the reasonable pricing of their services. So this paper proposes a method based on the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model) model to predict the future price of the cloud service, and choose the service is used ontology collaborative filtering algorithm. Finally, we take the cloud service of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) as an example to do experiment. The experimental results show our approach can find the optimal service price accuracy. This will make it possible to provide more accuracy service to user.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={With the popularity of cloud computing and micro service architectures, various service ecosystems including services, venders, and service-based processes continuously emerge on Internet or in an enterprise. Semantics of services from different venders may be described by distributed domain ontologies. Distributed knowledge brings difficulty to competition and cooperation among services, and hampers the evolution of a service ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a distributed knowledge based evolution model (DKEM) to promote competition and cooperation among services from different venders. DKEM considers stability as key factor in competition, and a stability evaluation model is designed to compute stability of services, venders, and service-based processes according to service invocation histories. Based on the evaluation model, two evolution patterns are given, and they can automatically explore new and more stable cooperation among services by means of runtime self-adaption mechanism. A prototype system for DKEM is implemented and a series of experiments show that DKEM is effective for competition and cooperation among services with distributed knowledge, and, evolved processes have higher stability and response efficiency.},

  pages={568-573},
  abstract={In today's era of digitization, due to the improper structuring of huge data available from various sources leading to poor interlinking of data, the web is not being utilized to its full potential. So, there is a need for re-establishing the structures of openly published data on the web by giving various specifications or frameworks of data published in cyberspace. With the aim of better utilization of web data and transition from keyword-based search to contextual search, the Semantic web has emerged as a key milestone. In this direction, Tim Berners Lee has proposed the conventions namely RDF and SPARQL for linking and querying the machine-processable shared data on the web and also a 5-star linked data scheme to distinguish the type of data on web based on its linking properties. This paper presents a Framework for Linking and querying open datasets on government portals, embedding semantics in the data by RDF alignment using state-of-art tools such as OpenRefine and Twinkle tool. The 5-Star scheme has been discussed and practical demonstration of enriching data is given. This clearly puts forward the transition from web of documents to web of data. This paper also presents the framework for translating the data in datasets to the graph based RDF data in Triple format. This translated data is then queried using standard SPARQL Queries showcasing the linked data fetched in tuple format. The data-graph of the resultant linked data is also presented.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Due to the emerging popularity of pervasive healthcare applications, tools for monitoring activities in smart homes are gaining momentum. Existing methods mainly rely on supervised learning algorithms for recognizing activities based on sensor data. A key issue with those approaches is the acquisition of comprehensive training sets of activities. Indeed, that task incurs significant costs in terms of manual labeling effort; moreover, labeling by external observers violates the individual's privacy. For these reasons, there is an increasing interest in unsupervised activity recognition methods. A popular approach relies on knowledge-based models expressed by ontologies of activities, environment and sensors. Unfortunately, those models require significant knowledge engineering efforts, and are often limited to a specific application. In this paper, we address the issues of existing methods by proposing a novel hybrid approach. Our intuition is that a generic knowledge-based model of activities can be refined to target specific individuals and environments by collaboratively acquiring feedback from inhabitants. Specifically, we propose a collaborative active learning method to refine correlations among sensor events and activity types that are initially extracted from a high-level ontology. Generic correlations are personalized to each target smart-home considering the similarity between the feedback target and the feedback provider in terms of environment and inhabitant's profiles. Moreover, thanks to this method, new sensors installed in the home are seamlessly integrated in the recognition framework. In order to reduce the burden of providing feedback, we also propose a technique to carefully select the conditions that trigger a feedback request. We conducted experiments with a real-world dataset and a generic ontology of activities. Results show that our hybrid method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised activity recognition techniques while triggering an acceptable number of feedback queries.},

  abstract={Security and Privacy challenges are the most obstacles for the advancement of cloud computing and the erosion of trust boundaries already happening in organizations is amplified and accelerated by this emerging technology. Policy Management Frameworks are the most proper solutions to create dedicated security levels based on the sensitivity of resources and according to the mapping process between requirements cloud customers and capabilities of service providers. The most concerning issue in these frameworks is the rate of perfect matches between capabilities and requirements. In this paper, a reliable ring analysis engine has been introduced to efficiently map the security requirements of cloud customers to the capabilities of service provider and to enhance the rate of perfect matches between them for establishment of different security levels in clouds. In the suggested model a structural index has been introduced to receive the requirement and efficiently map them to the most proper security mechanism of the service provider. Our results show that this index-based engine enhances the rate of perfect matches considerably and decreases the detected conflicts in syntactic and semantic analysis.},

  abstract={In the Cloud Computing field, with the increasing number of Cloud Services available thanks to several cloud providers, looking for a particular service has become very difficult, especially with the evolution of the stakeholders' needs. At the same time requirements specifications have become more and more complex to define in a formal representation and to analyse, since the stakeholders' goals are typically high-level, abstract, and hard-to-measure. For these reasons it would be useful to automate, as much as possible, requirements analysis. In this work we propose an automatic classification and modelling of requirements that are expressed in a natural language form, and an automatic identification of cloud services categories from requirements in order to support the development of a cloud application. Automated requirements analysis is not an easy subject, due to the natural languages variability and ambiguity, that's why different machine/deep learning and natural language processing approaches are used and compared. The target data set is provided by the Open-Security tera-PROMISE repository.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a method for automatic workflow extraction from texts using Process-Oriented Case-Based Reasoning (POCBR). While the current workflow management systems implement mostly different complicated graphical tasks based on advanced distributed solutions (e.g., cloud computing and grid computation), workflow knowledge acquisition from texts using case-based reasoning represents more expressive and semantic case representations. We propose in this context, an ontology-based workflow extraction framework to acquire processual knowledge from texts. Our methodology extends the classic NLP techniques to extract and disambiguate complex tasks and relations in texts. Using a graph-based representation of workflows and a domain ontology, our extraction process uses a context-aware approach to recognize workflow components in texts: data and control flows. We applied our framework in a technical domain in bioinformatics: i.e., phylogenetic analyses. An evaluation based on workflow semantic similarities in a gold standard proves that our approach provides promising results in the process extraction domain. Both data and implementation of our framework are available in: http://labo.bioinfo.uqam.ca/tgowler.},

  abstract={Today, new offering appears frequently and the demand on Cloud services is growing in an exponential rate. In such dynamic and competitive market, working in silos is not a successful strategy. In such dynamic and competitive market, a cloud provider is unable to meet the needs of customers dispersed all over the world, and relying only on a single cloud provider and working in silos is not a successful strategy. Therefore, single providers should integrate their resources and move up to a new level of cooperation and interconnection. This federation would bring in added value in terms of QoS, security, economics, etc. but also more complexity regarding security, federation management and interoperability establishment between disparate providers. In this paper, we will present an improved federation concept through a layered autonomous InterCloud reference model driven by Security and Interoperability. Also, we will propose an End to End Cloud security architecture based on a virtualized infrastructure, together with an improved security solution. This offers the ease of resources management, access security, and service availability and interoperability in a robust structure with lower costs.},

Annotate semantically big sets of scientific documents could facilitate the search and retrieval using the concepts contained in them.

  abstract={We propose an extension of the Open API specification (OAS) for the semantic description of RESTful services. We suggest that API descriptions (eg. on Clouds) be semantically annotated by associating OAS entities to entities in an ontology. The new approach, referred to Semantic OAS (SOAS) eliminates ambiguities and produces descriptions of RESTful services that are understandable by both, humans and machines. Moreover, SOAS descriptions are equivalent (i.e. can be translated) to an ontology. Therefore, SOAS services can be easily discovered (i.e. by other services), queried by Semantic Web query languages (e.g. SPARQL), checked by reasoners (e.g. Pellet) for consistency or inferring new (hidden) relationships and, finally, be used by service orchestration mechanisms.},

  abstract={Globally, a big data analytics technology is being issued in various business areas including the medical field. Because the technologies demand a large number of resources, studies on a distributed cloud including a hybrid cloud technology are needed. However, there are limitations of performance and cost since the most of hospitals use the private cloud of low computing resource. Thus, a research on the hybrid cloud is required to resolve the limitations. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a system called BigPros for medical big data processing with the proposed workflow model in the hybrid cloud resolving above issues. Based on this study, the BigPros can provide an efficient data processing method for a medical big data analytics in the hybrid cloud environment.},

  pages={2445-2449},
  abstract={An appropriate cloud service process can be obtained by applying similarity computation between service request and the existing service processes in renting or recommending cloud service processes. To improve efficiency of the similarity computation, a similarity computing method based on Levenshtein distance and logic Petri net for renting cloud service processes was proposed in this paper. Cloud service processes were first modeled as service nets by logic Petri nets. A method to generate path strings for service nets was put forward by introducing the routing identifiers. Business flows of cloud service processes were then converted into path strings based on reduction and recursion. Similarly, service request was mapped as a request string by the path string generating method. Finally, similarity computation was performed based on Levenshtein distance between path strings and request string. The algorithm for similarity computation was also presented. A case study was finally presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={The number of crowd computing applications is rapidly growing; however, they currently lack unification and interoperability as each platform usually has its own model of tasks, resources and computation process. We aim at the development of a unifying ontology-driven platform that would support deployment of various human-based applications. Key features of the proposed human-computer cloud platform are ontologies and digital contracts. Ontological mechanisms (ability to precisely define semantics and use inference to find related terms) are employed to find and allocate human resources required by software applications. Whereas digital contracts are leveraged to achieve predictability required by cloud users (application developers). The paper describes major principles behind the platform.},

  abstract={Hybrid Cloud, which is a cloud deployment model that integrates the public cloud and private cloud, is gaining considerable attention recently. The key technology for building a Hybrid Cloud environment involves the integration of different types of clouds. In this paper, the concept of Hybrid CSB and a method to solve the cloud integration problem are proposed. We present a structure for recommending a service based on a pattern according to users' requirements. In addition, we propose a method for integrating the recommended services with an integration script and a script generation process. The recommendation and integration method proposed in this study is expected to be used as an underlying technology to facilitate the transition to the Hybrid Cloud environment.},

  abstract={Companies adhere to federate environments in order to add value to their businesses by aggregating third parties services. Cloud computing comes in hand in this process speeding up the development and deployment of new service providers (SPs) and identity providers (IdPs) to be used into a federated environment. However, IdPs and SPs of OpenID Connect federations have a strong dependency on each other, they have to use the very same attribute names in order to exchange data. Our proposal lowers the dependency between IdPs and SPs using web semantics; instead of an agreement at a lower level such as attributes names, we propose that IdPs and SPs establish an agreement on the ontology to be used. Therefore, the name of attributes would not matter, but the semantic concept that attributes are associated with. Further, our proposal was added and tested into the OpenId Connect Implementation called MITREid Connect.},

  abstract={This paper presented a novel approach for document clustering applying cloud technologies for the system's performance issue. It is critical for application service in cloud computing to provide precise information. Ontology servicing is one of the methods to deal with semantic ambiguity and information overload efficiently through appropriate semantic models and semantic technology. This system is the advanced and extended version of the system we have been published before. The experiments reveal that even the testing documents increased; the system may actually be able to produce useful result for text document clustering. In this paper, we propose a cloud service that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching. Our approach has the capability to perform cloud service concepts from cloud service sources. The main idea behind our method is cloud services using an ontology-based technique.},

  abstract={Knowledge is a basic requirement in the era of globalization. The act of acquiring knowledge is learning and with the advent of technology, learning has become easier. E-Learning is a popular learning method which uses the web or other technologies to promote learning. A very traditional learning method is discussed and some new methods with the integration of modern technology have been discussed. Although technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, ontology, fuzzy logic etc. have been used in learning systems they are still less automated, not personalized and do not pose the capability to self-learn. A method is proposed to increase the automation and self-learning in the e-learning management systems. Further, the personalization of learning for the user so that every type of learner can learn from the type and level of the content the learner seems fit is the main aim. The proposed system is feasible, economical and scalable which makes it suitable for every level.},

  abstract={Despite the evident proliferation of Cloud Services (CS), many challenges hinder efficient service discovery and selection processes. A strong key enabler is use of ontology in CS domain. However, no broad cloud ontology has dominated yet. In this regard, we propose a fully-fledged comprehensive business domain ontology for CS with querying capabilities. The proposed CS ontology encompasses cloud taxonomy, delivery, deployment and price models. In addition to technical and computing aspects, it also covers business aspects of CS. Distinctively, it elaborates on non-functional aspects that are usually neglected in CS semantic modeling. It encompasses in-depth coverage of service characteristics, quality of service metrics and service level agreement terms. We present ontology development methodology, conceptual model and implementation details. Proposed CS ontology can be perceived as a knowledge base for CS discovery and selection. It was published as contribution to the research community.},

  abstract={The widespread deployment of web services and rapid development of big data applications bring in new challenges to web service compositions in the context of big data. The large number of web services processing a huge amount of diverse data together with the complex and dynamic relationships among the services require automatic composition of semantic web services to be performed quickly, thereby demanding more efficient service composition algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the issue of web service composition in big data environments by proposing novel composition algorithms with low time-complexity. Specifically, we decompose the service composition into three stages - construction of parameter expansion graphs, transformation of service dependence graphs, and backtracking search for service compositions. Based on the parameter expansion strategies, we then propose two efficient semantic web service composition algorithms and analyze their time complexity. We also conduct comparison experimentally to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms and validate their effectiveness using a big data (service composition) set.},

This paper presents an approach based on semantic publish/subscribe paradigm to the development of collaborative editing applications. The main aim of this research work consists in exploiting emerging technologies (i.e. semantic web data representation formalisms, publish-subscribe platforms) in order to (1) overcome limitations coming from the traditional paradigm of single-author workflows, (2) enhance the editing capabilities of the users, (3) ease the development and maintainment of applications and (4) provide a shared high- level abstraction of the documents that fosters information-level interoperability and reusability. The proposed approach is then validated through an ad-hoc vector graphics application, SCEd (Semantic Collaborative Editor) built upon a SPARQL Event Processing Architecture derived from the Smart-M3 semantic publish-subscribe platform.},
