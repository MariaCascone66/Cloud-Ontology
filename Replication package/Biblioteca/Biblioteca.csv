Following this trend, more and more Web services and cloud services have been developed and made publicly available on the Web. These publicly available services will be important components for service-oriented system construction. However, these large numbers of services increase the burden of service selection in service-oriented system construction. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network-based service matchmaking approach to match services according to developer requests in service-oriented system construction. In the model, the convolutional neural network aims to learn the semantic feature representation for matchmaking. We experimented on a real-world dataset, ProgammableWeb.com, and experiment results show that the proposed approach can help find relevant services according to developer requests.","2020-07-17","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","204-207","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE 10th International Conference on Electronics Information and Emergency Communication (ICEIEC)","","","","Semantics; Ontologies; Convolutional neural networks; Mashups; Task analysis; Feature extraction; Convolutional Neural Network; Matchmaking; Service-oriented System","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE 10th International Conference on Electronics Information and Emergency Communication (ICEIEC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the small granularity of DRs provided by cloud provider, it is difficult for the cloud services to match with design tasks if there is no initiative resource. For example, because of the lack of initiative perception capabilities, it is difficult for design software to match with design tasks directly. A method of DR multi-granularity modeling with two-stage aggregation is proposed, by which the resource granularity is increased and dynamic design capability is formed. In the proposed DR multi-granularity model, DRs are classified into three granularities: Static Physical Resource (SPR), Dynamic Capacity Resource (DCR), and Cross-functional Design Unit (CDU). Their ontology models are set up to represent the basic function, structure and component of DRs. In the two-stage aggregation of DRs, two strategies are proposed to increase the granularity of DRs. The first is DCR aggregation strategy based on auxiliary resources actively pushing, and the second is CDU aggregation strategy based on meta task and meta capability matching. Using the operation parameters of DRs and the associated evaluation matrix, a method of DCR and CDU evaluation is proposed to optimize the searched DRs. With the help of the preceding multi-granularity DR modeling and the two-stage access strategy, DR granularity is enlarged and initiative design capability is formed, which solves the problem of DRs matching with design tasks because of small resource granularity.","2020","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","130797-130819","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Optimization; Ontologies; Software; Task analysis; Dynamic scheduling; Cloud manufacturing; Manufacturing; ontology modeling; multi-granularity design resource; resource aggregation; resource evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, service providers maintaining their end-user's private attributes have seen a surge in compliance requirements. Since most of these regulations are not available in a machine-processable format, it requires significant manual effort to adhere to them. Often many of the laws have overlapping rules, but as they are not referencing each other, providers must duplicate efforts to comply with each regulation. We have done a detailed study of all the data protection regulations that apply to Cloud data. We have developed an integrated, semantically rich knowledge graph that captures these various data compliance regulations. It includes the data threats and security controls that are needed to mitigate the risks. In this paper, we present this knowledge graph in detail, along with the system that we have developed to evaluate it. We have validated our knowledge graph against the privacy policies of various Cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, IBM, and Rackspace.

However, existing research on SSM mostly involves logical or non-logical matching, leading to unavoidable false-positive and false-negative problems. Combining different types of SSM methods is an effective way to improve this situation, but the adaptive combination of different service matching methods is still a difficult issue. To conquer this difficulty, a hybrid SSM method, which is based on a random forest and combines the advantages of existing SSM methods, is proposed in this paper. The result of each SSM method is treated as a multi-dimensional feature vector input for the random forest, converting the service matching into a two classification problem. Therefore, our method avoids the flaws found in manual threshold setting. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an outstanding performance.","2020-12","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","798-812","","6","25","","Tsinghua Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontologies; Decision trees; Cognition; false-negative; false-positive; logic-based service matchmaking; random forest; Random forests; Semantic Service Matchmaking (SSM); Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lu","A Compact Brain Storm Algorithm for Matching Ontologies","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977763","","An ontology can formally present the domain knowledge by specifying the domain concepts and their relationships, which is a kernel technique for addressing the data heterogeneity issue in the semantic web. However, since existing ontologies are developed and maintained independently by different communities, a concept and its relationship with the others could be described in different ways, yielding the ontology heterogeneity problem. To solve this problem, in this work, we formally construct an optimal model for it, and propose a similarity measure for distinguishing identical ontology entities. Since determining the high-quality ontology alignment is a complex process, we propose to utilize a Brain Storm Optimization algorithm (BSO) to optimize the alignment. BSO is a recently developed Swarm Intelligence algorithm (SI), which can effectively solve the complex optimization problem by imitating the human's idea generating process. However, classic BSO needs to cluster various ideas in each generation and carry out the evolving operators on all ideas, which increases the computational complexity. To improve the efficiency of BSO-based ontology matcher, a Compact BSO (CBSO) is further proposed, which can reduce the memory consumption by utilizing the probabilistic representation on the idea cluster, and improve the algorithm's speed through the compact crossover operator and perturbation operator. The experiment uses the benchmark track provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) to test our approach's performance. The comparisons among the state-of-the-art ontology matchers and our proposal show that CBSO-based ontology matcher can efficiently determine high-quality ontology alignments.","2020","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","43898-43907","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Optimization; Ontologies; Clustering algorithms; Ontology matching; Storms; Measurement; compact brain storm optimization algorithm; Memory management; ontology alignment evaluation initiative; Particle swarm optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data security of multiple cloud-based services is also susceptible to these threats, due to the high dependency on traditional routing protocols. Although a number of hijacking detection techniques have been recently proposed, no existing system has effectively addressed the problem of detecting malicious transit Autonomous System (AS) services in any detected hijacking occurrences. The ability to locate and isolate malicious services is critical for conducting a necessary mitigation strategy at an early stage, to minimise the impact of the attack, to restore cloud services quickly. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time processing method, so-called Ontological Graph Identification (OGI), for detecting IP prefix hijacking of nodes and suspicious transit nodes caused by the hijacked nodes through ASs. The proposed method is evaluated using the two public datasets of RIPE RIS and RouteView. Experimental results revealed improved performance for the detection of malicious transit nodes compared with peer techniques. It is, therefore, shown that the proposed method has utility in automating the process of investigating nodes with suspicious activities in real network systems.","2020","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:36:28","","1164-1174","","","15","","IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: K.-K.R.

To effectively manage and integrate security requirements in the cloud, the provider and customer needs to negotiate and agree upon the applied security policies. However, there is no standard way of expressing cloud security policies in a vendor-agnostic manner. Cloud security and privacy policies are often stated in an informal and ad-hoc manner, which leads to policy conflicts, incompleteness, ambiguity and inconsistencies. In this paper, we present CERBERUS, a framework for representing cloud security and privacy policies and detecting potential problems in the policies. CERBERUS adopts an object-oriented approach and consists of an ontology and notation, policies, guidelines and rules, and a tool for capturing and detecting policy errors. Using CERBERUS, policies can be analyzed for potential problems, including policy conflicts, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness. An application of CERBERUS shows that it indeed helps to discover policy errors, which otherwise would go undetected or in many cases would be detected a posteriori at runtime.","2019-11-18","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:35:33","","214-221","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE 5th International Conference on Big Data Intelligence and Computing (DATACOM)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: A.

Specially in Robotics, ontologies can be used as a standard way to represent and share knowledge and reasoning among autonomous agents. CORA (core ontology or robotics and automation) is a standard ontology developed by the IEEE ORA working group mapping main concepts and axioms from the robotics and automation (R&A) domain. After CORA has been approved as an official IEEE standard, ORA was split in different sub-groups addressing, among other topics, task representation (RTR) and autonomous robots architectures (AuR). This paper presents a simulation study on a multirobot reconnaissance application intended to serve as proof-ofconcept on the feasibility of the CORA ontology and its related architecture. We show how robots and tasks are represented and dynamically mapped into the ontology, as well discuss some technical aspects of our simulation when dealing with the proposed architecture.

The achieved results not only make true NFV and 5G promises, notably those referring to on-demand networks, service customization and time-to-market acceleration, but they open the door to the deployment of private tailored cloud-native 5G networks.","2019-10-01","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","32-39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 10th International Conference on Networks of the Future (NoF)","","","","Cloud computing; Network slicing; Ontologies; Automation; 5G; SDN; 3GPP; 5G mobile communication; NFV; On-demand Networks; ONAP; Virtual private networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 10th International Conference on Networks of the Future (NoF)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The stream setting offers the opportunity to exploit synergies and, theoretically, share the access and processing costs between multiple different collaborators. But what should be the monetary contribution of each consumer when they do not trust each other and have varying valuations of the differing outcomes? In this article, we present Collaborative Stream Processing (CSP), a model where the costs, which are set exogenously by providers, are shared between multiple consumers, the collaborators. For this, we identify three important requirements for CSP to establish trust between the collaborators and propose a CSP algorithm, ENCSPA, adhering to these requirements. Based on the collaborators' outcome valuations and the costs of the raw data streams, ENCSPA computes the payment for each collaborator. At the same time, ENCSPA ensures that no collaborator has an incentive to manipulate the system by providing misinformation about her/his value, budget, or time limit. We show that ENCSPA can calculate payments in a reasonable amount of time for up to one thousand collaborators.","2019-12-09","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","3498-3505","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","","","","Cloud computing; Big Data; Trust; Collaboration; Data models; Computational modeling; Runtime; TV; Cost Sharing; Stream Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, security risks remain major concerns. One of the main challenges is how to evaluate the security level of cloud services. Among the problems arising are the large variety of knowledge associated with the security domain and the heterogeneity of cloud services descriptions. An effective solution to such problems is ontologies. Ontologies provide a more structured and formal representation of a particular domain, which will help to reduce the conceptual ambiguity and enable automatic reasoning functionalities. In this paper, we propose an ontology for cloud services security evaluation based on industry standards and best practices. Some of the core concepts included in the ontology are the target, criteria, yardstick, data gathering techniques and data synthesis approaches. The concepts are grouped into five general categories, namely: context, assumptions, external factors, activities, and outcomes. The ontology is implemented using Protégé tool and validated through different uses case scenarios.","2019-12-20","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:36:11","","1012-1018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE 4th Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 5; Conference name: 4th IEEE Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IAEAC 2019; Conference location: Chengdu; Conference sponsors: Chengdu Global Union Academy of Science and Technology; Chongqing Geeks Education Technology Co., Ltd; Chongqing Global Union Academy of Science and Technology; Global Union Academy of Science and Technology; IEEE Beijing Section; School of Science, Lanzhou University of Technology</p>","","","Cloud computing; cloud computing; Ontology; Distributed database systems; Security ontologies; Security; Ontologies; Web services; Cost effectiveness; NIST; ontologies; Service industry; Automatic reasoning; Formal representations; Industry standards; Large organizations; Resource-efficient; security evaluation; Security evaluation; security ontologies; services evaluation; Measurement; Computational modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE 4th Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the development of big data with high dimensionality, data storage possibility over cloud has created large scope in recent times. Document clustering is the fundamental topic that turned into an indispensable component in many areas like cloud computing. Document clustering partitions the document into significant classes or groups for retrieving the relevant document. Many researchers used the factorization methods and ontologies for internal and external knowledge based document clustering. However, existing methods failed to provide the semantic feature construction and leads to the information loss while covering all the ideas in documents. In order to address these problems, different document clustering techniques in cloud has been reviewed in this paper. In addition to that Document clustering by Entropy-based Boosting with Projection Neural Feature (EB-PNF) method is presented. The proposed method involves two stages. They are, similar document identification based on semantic similarity score, feature extraction which includes the extraction of both single and multi-label features based on the precision, recall and computational complexity to prove that EB-PNF method produces high-quality clusters comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.","2019-11-27","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:36:21","","1163-1169","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2nd International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology, ICSSIT 2019; Conference location: Tirunelveli</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontology; Knowledge based systems; Digital storage; Ontologies; Information retrieval; Extraction; Clustering algorithms; Feature extraction; ontologies; Cluster analysis; Boosting; dimensionality; Document clustering; Document Clustering; Entropy; factorization; Factorization; Projection Neural Feature; semantic feature; Semantic features; Databases; Computational complexity; Clustering methods; Smart systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed model takes into account the different relationships and dependencies between services across Cloud's layers. These dependencies are represented by the different constraints of composition and deployment. To validate our proposal, qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted. The qualitative evaluation is carried out by making comparisons with both state-of-the-art works and the Bitnami platform according to some criteria.

The result is a disadvantage particularly for SMEs, which generate their competitive advantage from innovative production technologies and symbiotic connections with customers and other SMEs. The focus of Collective Cloud Manufacturing (CCM) is the preservation of these characteristics, in which an over-approximation of costs through the integration of production-related simulations is to be reduced and the data security of the customer is to be enhanced.

New technologies are being incorporated continuously into our day-to-day life, introducing new shapes for traditional and original kinds of businesses. Nevertheless, it is interesting to notice that most novelty is based mainly on processes, rather than on technology. A DT initiative should start with conceptual modeling to organize and structure knowledge of its scope. However, there is not a specific proper language to model DT initiatives. Based on an extensive literature review, we propose an Ontology - the DI-BPM-Onto - with this purpose. The ontology proposed conceptualizes three aspects: Digital Transformation and Innovation (DT&I), Business Process Management Contextual Factors, and Digital Technology, which are independent layers, but orthogonally related. On the other side, modeling tools like the well-known standard ArchiMate are widely used by companies to provide an unambiguous understanding of their businesses, and already support the description, analysis, and visualization of most enterprise architecture (EA) elements. Therefore, in this paper, to better model DT initiatives, we propose a Reference Model that extending the ArchiMate with the main concepts of DT identified in the DI-BPM-Onto to better model DT&I initiatives and to discuss to what extent ArchiMate would support the implementation of DT&I initiatives.

In this paper, we investigate the proof of encryption problem. Restricted by available resources and hardware capabilities, some end users need to outsource the strong encryption operations of data to external service providers. Verification of the correct execution of encryption is a problem since it is directly related to data safety. We first define the expected properties of the Proof of Encryption (PoE) mechanisms. We propose two mechanisms based on whether or not the service requester is aware of the encryption key. They allow an end user to verify that corresponding encryption algorithm and key strength are honored. We describe the details of the verification procedures.

Specifically, the method extends and optimizes the existing method with Quick Service Quick List (QSQL) by extracting synonyms of ontology concepts from WordNet. The method not only can provide a unified representation of HPC resources, but also can support semantic-based fuzzy matching.

Although there are some private cloud service marketplaces, such as Microsoft Azure, that allow consumers to search service advertainment belonging to a given vendor. However, due to an increase in the number of cloud service advertisement, a consumer needs to find related services across the worldwide web (WWW). A consumer mostly uses a search engine such as Google, Bing, for the service advertisement discovery. However, these search engines are insufficient in retrieving related cloud services advertainments on time. There is a need for a framework that effectively and efficiently discovery of the related service advertisement for ordinary users. This paper addresses the issue by proposing a user-friendly harvester and a centralised cloud service repository framework. The proposed Centralised Cloud Service Repository (CCSR) framework has two modules - Harvesting as-a-Service (HaaS) and the service repository module. The HaaS module allows users to extract real-time data from the web and make it available to different file format without the need to write any code. The service repository module provides a centralised cloud service repository that enables a consumer for efficient and effective cloud service discovery. We validate and demonstrate the suitability of our framework by comparing its efficiency and feasibility with three widely used open-source harvesters. From the evaluative result, we observe that when we harvest a large number of services advertisements, the HaaS is more efficient compared with the traditional harvesting tools.

Existing approaches have either a scalability bottleneck by requiring that patients approve each sharing of their medical data or a trust bottleneck by having a single authority control every access thereby creating the problem of a single point of attack. To address both these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that enables policy based multi-authority access authorization to EHR systems accessed by multiple care providers from different locations or organizations. This framework, which resides on the Edge, has been built using the Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA-ABE) and Semantic Web technologies to provide a secure, semantically rich approach to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations who manage different attributes of end users using a shared dataset. In this paper, we describe our novel approach along with the proof of concept prototype that we created to evaluate our framework.","2019-07-08","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:35:43","","107-109","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 19; Conference name: 3rd IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing, EDGE 2019; Conference location: Milan; Conference sponsors: IEEE; IEEE Computer Society</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Knowledge graphs; Attribute based access control; Edge computing; Ontologies; Data privacy; Cryptography; Encryption; Access control; Attribute-based encryptions; Access Handler; Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC); Crypto modules; Document Processor & Crypto Module; Knowledge Graph (Ontologies); Electronic medical records; Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA ABE); Organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The exchange of data between the involved partners plays a critical role. The needs of the customer, the current order situation of the supplier as well as the manufacturing process dependencies of the manufacturer must be coordinated in a symbiotic manner to achieve efficient production. Therefore, this paper presents a variant of cloud manufacturing, collective cloud manufacturing, which focuses on the formation of cross-company symbioses to exchange production information in an environment isolated for data protection via an evolutionary needs model. For this purpose, a previously presented concept and the challenges of industry strategies are described to show how the concept of collective cloud manufacturing can meet the requirements of digitalization.","2019-07-15","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","594-603","","","01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE 21st Conference on Business Informatics (CBI)","","","","Cloud computing; Industry 4.0; Cloud manufacturing; Data models; Production; Companies; Manufacturing; Production process planning; Service-oriented manufacturing; Solid modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE 21st Conference on Business Informatics (CBI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, cloud computing as a crucial part of Industry 4.0 facilitates distribution of computer resources without direct active management by users. Accordingly, an ontology enables efficient integration and management of data as a reference data model through representation of knowledge.

The architecture of the Smart Factory is consisted of three primary layers, namely perception layer, deployment layer, and executing layer. A Manufacturing's Semantics Ontology based knowledgebase is introduced in the perception layer, which is responsible for plan scheduling of pharmaceutical production. The reconfigurable plans are generated from the production demand of drugs as well as the information statement of low-level machine resources. To further functionality reconfiguration and low-level controlling, the IEC 61499 standard is also introduced for functionality modeling and machine controlling.

To answer these questions, one must solve a resource management problem, that is, the allocation of computing, storage, networking and (indirectly) cost resources to a set of applications such that the performance objectives of the application are fulfilled. There are many approaches which answer separately these questions but there is no comprehensive and easily usable solution for these issues. MANeUveR solves them by integrating the following components: 1) a Web User Interface offers the end user the possibility to describe his application in terms of interactions between components and their software and hardware requirements, 2) an Offers Management System, through a crawler, periodically updates an ontology with infrastructure and services details from different CPs, 3) a Recommendation Engine provides a (sub) optimal solution for application deployment in the CP infrastructure regarding the leasing price of the virtual machines needed for deployment and their characteristics.

In particular, Web Service composition methods can solve complex service integrations. However, in highly dynamic environments, these manual service compositions still requires a lot of effort. To address this challenge, researchers have recently introduced semantic web service composition methods. The growing interest in this topic of semantic web service composition has led to an increasing number of approaches, which has not been systematically surveyed so far. Researchers have reported several surveys in the related areas such as web service composition or semantic web service search. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provides a survey about these semantic web service compositions in particular. Hence, this review aims to address this issue by identifying existing efforts on semantic web service compositions. The survey focuses on two aspects (i) semantic web service description, as it is an essential aspect for semantic service composition, (ii) semantic web service composition, to identify methods and their implementations on the real world problem.","2018-10-30","2025-11-10 09:28:45","2025-11-10 09:28:45","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 2nd International Conference on Informatics and Computational Sciences (ICICoS)","","","","Semantic Web; Semantics; Linked data; Ontologies; Web services; semantic service composition; Databases; Bibliographies; semantic APIs; semantic service description; semantic web services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 2nd International Conference on Informatics and Computational Sciences (ICICoS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are several deployment technologies and languages available suitable for deploying applications to a single cloud provider. However, for multi-cloud application deployments, multiple technologies have to be used and orchestrated. In addition, the event-driven nature of serverless computing imposes further requirements on modeling such application structures in order to automate their deployment. In this paper, we tackle these issues by introducing an event-driven deployment modeling approach using the standard Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) that fully employs the suggested standard lifecycle to provision and manage multi-cloud serverless applications.

While several tools exist for providing semantic annotation to web documents, the techniques used in these tools vary very widely. Also, the mode of implementation and the solutions offered by the tools are inconsistent with each other leaving end users confused on the appropriate tool for use to deliver their expected results. Based on these, a holistic perspective to the development of semantic annotation tools as well as their implementation is necessary. This is to ensure uniformity in the expected end results and guarantee a continuous, dynamic and consistent semantic annotation for web documents; encompassing the complete needs of end users. To achieve this, cloud computing is proposed for the delivery of semantic annotation as a holistic service, as it provides an enabling environment for processing the vast amount of data required to annotate web documents. Also, cloud computing essential characteristics such as ubiquitous network access, rapid elasticity and on-demand self-service are very necessary to achieve a holistic semantic annotation service for documents on the web.

To realize this, it handles a hierarchical structure by using the knowledge stored in the forms of ontology and rules for bridging among different levels of instructions. Accordingly, the framework has multiple layers of processing components; perception and actuation control at the low level, symbolic planner and Watson APIs for cognitive capabilities and semantic understanding, and orchestration of these components by a new open source robot middleware called Project Intu at its core. We show how this framework can be used in a complex scenario where multiple actors (human, a communication robot, and an industrial robot) collaborate to perform a common industrial task. Human teaches an assembly task to Pepper (a humanoid robot from SoftBank Robotics) using natural language conversation and demonstration. Our framework helps Pepper perceive the human demonstration and generate a sequence of actions for UR5 (collaborative robot arm from Universal Robots), which ultimately performs the assembly (e.g. insertion) task.","2018-05-21","2025-11-10 09:28:46","2025-11-10 09:28:46","","527-534","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","","","","Natural languages; Task analysis; Middleware; Service robots; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing authorization models follow a patient centric approach for EHR management where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients' end. This however creates a significant overhead for the patient who has to authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given the multiple personnel involved in providing care and that at times the patient may not be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need of developing a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy cloud-based EHR management. We have developed a novel, centralized, attribute based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based EHR's access authority to the medical providers. In this paper, we describe this novel ABE approach as well as the prototype system that we have created to illustrate it.","2018-07-02","2025-11-10 09:28:46","2025-11-10 09:36:25","","932-935","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 IEEE 11th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 76; Conference name: 11th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing, CLOUD 2018; Conference location: San Francisco; CA; Conference sponsors: IEEE; IEEE Computer Society</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Knowledge graphs; Medical computing; Attribute based access control; Digital storage; Ontologies; Electronic health record; Electronic Health Record (EHR); Cryptography; Encryption; Access control; Hospital data processing; Knowledge Graph (Ontology); Cloud storages; Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC); Electronic document exchange; Access Broker; Attribute based encryption (ABE); Cloud Storage; Attribute Based Encryption (ABE); Medical services; Organizations; Attribute Based Encryption (ABE), Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), Electronic Health Record (EHR), Cloud Storage, Semantic Web, Access Broker, Knowledge Graph (Ontology), Cloud Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE 11th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, we developed SAM - the Semantic-aware Middleware - and the SAM Store. The latter resembles a registry. It allows component providers to publish semantically enriched interfaces and to offer corresponding local and remote implementations. SAM makes use of the SAM Store to match local interprocess communication (IPC) messages transparently against local and remote components.

Semantics of services from different venders may be described by distributed domain ontologies. Distributed knowledge brings difficulty to competition and cooperation among services, and hampers the evolution of a service ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a distributed knowledge based evolution model (DKEM) to promote competition and cooperation among services from different venders. DKEM considers stability as key factor in competition, and a stability evaluation model is designed to compute stability of services, venders, and service-based processes according to service invocation histories. Based on the evaluation model, two evolution patterns are given, and they can automatically explore new and more stable cooperation among services by means of runtime self-adaption mechanism. A prototype system for DKEM is implemented and a series of experiments show that DKEM is effective for competition and cooperation among services with distributed knowledge, and, evolved processes have higher stability and response efficiency.","2018-07-02","2025-11-10 09:28:46","2025-11-10 09:36:05","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 14; Conference name: 25th IEEE International Conference on Web Services, ICWS 2018; Conference location: San Francisco; CA; Conference sponsors: IEEE; IEEE Computer Society</p>","","","Semantics; Knowledge based systems; Ontologies; Web services; Distributed knowledge; Ecosystems; Websites; Runtime self-adaptation; Self adaptation; Service ecosystem; Service ecosystems; Service evolution; Service evolutions; Stability; Stability evaluation; Business; distributed knowledge; Runtime; runtime self-adaptation; service ecosystem; service evolution; Stability analysis; stability evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So, there is a need for re-establishing the structures of openly published data on the web by giving various specifications or frameworks of data published in cyberspace. With the aim of better utilization of web data and transition from keyword-based search to contextual search, the Semantic web has emerged as a key milestone. In this direction, Tim Berners Lee has proposed the conventions namely RDF and SPARQL for linking and querying the machine-processable shared data on the web and also a 5-star linked data scheme to distinguish the type of data on web based on its linking properties. This paper presents a Framework for Linking and querying open datasets on government portals, embedding semantics in the data by RDF alignment using state-of-art tools such as OpenRefine and Twinkle tool. The 5-Star scheme has been discussed and practical demonstration of enriching data is given. This clearly puts forward the transition from web of documents to web of data. This paper also presents the framework for translating the data in datasets to the graph based RDF data in Triple format. This translated data is then queried using standard SPARQL Queries showcasing the linked data fetched in tuple format.

Existing methods mainly rely on supervised learning algorithms for recognizing activities based on sensor data. A key issue with those approaches is the acquisition of comprehensive training sets of activities. Indeed, that task incurs significant costs in terms of manual labeling effort; moreover, labeling by external observers violates the individual's privacy. For these reasons, there is an increasing interest in unsupervised activity recognition methods. A popular approach relies on knowledge-based models expressed by ontologies of activities, environment and sensors. Unfortunately, those models require significant knowledge engineering efforts, and are often limited to a specific application. In this paper, we address the issues of existing methods by proposing a novel hybrid approach. Our intuition is that a generic knowledge-based model of activities can be refined to target specific individuals and environments by collaboratively acquiring feedback from inhabitants. Specifically, we propose a collaborative active learning method to refine correlations among sensor events and activity types that are initially extracted from a high-level ontology. Generic correlations are personalized to each target smart-home considering the similarity between the feedback target and the feedback provider in terms of environment and inhabitant's profiles. Moreover, thanks to this method, new sensors installed in the home are seamlessly integrated in the recognition framework. In order to reduce the burden of providing feedback, we also propose a technique to carefully select the conditions that trigger a feedback request. We conducted experiments with a real-world dataset and a generic ontology of activities. Results show that our hybrid method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised activity recognition techniques while triggering an acceptable number of feedback queries.","2018-03-19","2025-11-10 09:28:46","2025-11-10 09:28:46","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","","","","Semantics; Ontologies; Collaboration; Training; Activity recognition; Correlation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the current workflow management systems implement mostly different complicated graphical tasks based on advanced distributed solutions (e.g., cloud computing and grid computation), workflow knowledge acquisition from texts using case-based reasoning represents more expressive and semantic case representations. We propose in this context, an ontology-based workflow extraction framework to acquire processual knowledge from texts. Our methodology extends the classic NLP techniques to extract and disambiguate complex tasks and relations in texts. Using a graph-based representation of workflows and a domain ontology, our extraction process uses a context-aware approach to recognize workflow components in texts: data and control flows. We applied our framework in a technical domain in bioinformatics: i.e., phylogenetic analyses. An evaluation based on workflow semantic similarities in a gold standard proves that our approach provides promising results in the process extraction domain.

In such dynamic and competitive market, working in silos is not a successful strategy. In such dynamic and competitive market, a cloud provider is unable to meet the needs of customers dispersed all over the world, and relying only on a single cloud provider and working in silos is not a successful strategy. Therefore, single providers should integrate their resources and move up to a new level of cooperation and interconnection. This federation would bring in added value in terms of QoS, security, economics, etc. but also more complexity regarding security, federation management and interoperability establishment between disparate providers. In this paper, we will present an improved federation concept through a layered autonomous InterCloud reference model driven by Security and Interoperability. Also, we will propose an End to End Cloud security architecture based on a virtualized infrastructure, together with an improved security solution. This offers the ease of resources management, access security, and service availability and interoperability in a robust structure with lower costs.","2017-11-17","2025-11-10 09:28:46","2025-11-10 09:28:46","","166-173","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 European Conference on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)","","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Interoperability; Security; Cloud Federation; Computer architecture; Architecture; Service-oriented architecture; Complexity theory; InterCloud; Reference Model; Security Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 European Conference on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve efficiency of the similarity computation, a similarity computing method based on Levenshtein distance and logic Petri net for renting cloud service processes was proposed in this paper. Cloud service processes were first modeled as service nets by logic Petri nets. A method to generate path strings for service nets was put forward by introducing the routing identifiers. Business flows of cloud service processes were then converted into path strings based on reduction and recursion. Similarly, service request was mapped as a request string by the path string generating method. Finally, similarity computation was performed based on Levenshtein distance between path strings and request string. The algorithm for similarity computation was also presented.

Our proposal lowers the dependency between IdPs and SPs using web semantics; instead of an agreement at a lower level such as attributes names, we propose that IdPs and SPs establish an agreement on the ontology to be used.

The large number of web services processing a huge amount of diverse data together with the complex and dynamic relationships among the services require automatic composition of semantic web services to be performed quickly, thereby demanding more efficient service composition algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the issue of web service composition in big data environments by proposing novel composition algorithms with low time-complexity. Specifically, we decompose the service composition into three stages - construction of parameter expansion graphs, transformation of service dependence graphs, and backtracking search for service compositions. Based on the parameter expansion strategies, we then propose two efficient semantic web service composition algorithms and analyze their time complexity. We also conduct comparison experimentally to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms and validate their effectiveness using a big data (service composition) set.","2017-12-04","2025-11-10 09:28:46","2025-11-10 09:28:46","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Semantics; Time complexity; Big Data applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Introducing the knowledge graph into recommendation can alleviate the sparsity effectively. Existing general KGs focus on static knowledge of attractions, but these public attributes provide less value for users’ decision making in tourism. To improve the recommendation performance, it is necessary to introduce more meaningful information which is of greater interest to tourists. We present a novel knowledge graph construction paradigm—Travel Event Knowledge Graph (TEKG), which focuses on describing tourists’ behaviors and experiences in tourism events. Taking a travelogue as a travel event, we set the travelogue as the main entity instead of attractions, and introduce the ""4W1H"" event description framework to organize the information in travelogues effectively.

To perform complex tasks like monitoring road transport facilities entails huge resources for storing interactive data online. The concept of transport enterprises moving to cloud systems opens up gaps in data management in hybrid and multi-cloud systems. To solve such problems, the implementation of the Data Fabric structure allows you to integrate data and metadata for use on various platforms. The sustainable development of such platforms is facilitated by the use of the Data Fabric mechanism as a built-in system for standardization and coding, the implementation of semantic compatibility, proprietary knowledge graphs and the domain of data values of the transport industry. Data Fabric helps organizations solve complex data problems and use cases by managing their data regardless of application types, platforms, and storage locations, while ensuring seamless data access and sharing in a distributed data environment. The article analyzes the stability of the Data Fabric platform as a domain-oriented decomposition model based on a distributed data architecture with centralized management, but not as a fragmented data warehouse. Using the example of such a decomposition, it is necessary to model an architecture that organizes analytical and other data by areas. In this architecture, the domain's interface with the rest of the organization includes not only operational capabilities, but also access to the analytical data that the domain serves to scale the system.","2023-03-14","2025-11-10 09:28:52","2025-11-10 09:35:56","","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 Systems of Signals Generating and Processing in the Field of on Board Communications","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: N.G.

Therefore, analysing the adaptability of self-care for developing countries is of prime importance. We have investigated how health posts and pharmacies could promote self-care in developing countries. We have restricted ourselves on the ways these organizations could assist patients in exploiting health-oriented network services such as Personal Health Records (PHRs) and public medical data sources. Our ultimate goal is to promote information therapy (Ix) as it aims to prescribe the right information to right people at right time. In our solution, Ix is carried out by a SPARQL engine, which is capable for accessing PHRs and other medical data sources within a query. Thus we can augment patient's data in PHR by external data sources. Such automatic augmentation is based on the overlapping ontologies that model PHRs' data as well the data in public medical data sources.","2016-05-11","2025-11-10 09:28:52","2025-11-10 09:34:37","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IST-Africa Week Conference","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 2; Conference name: 2016 IST-Africa Conference, IST-Africa 2016; Conference location: Durban</p>","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Ontologies; Personnel; Search engines; Semantic web; Health; Developing countries; Medical data; External data sources; Information therapies; Information therapy; Network services; Personal health record; Personal health records; Self-care; Guidelines; Vocabulary; Medical treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IST-Africa Week Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This includes combat in Germany, Japan and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. However not all of our stabilization and reconstruction operations (SARO) have been as successful. Several studies have been carried out on SARO by organizations such as the National Defense University and the Naval Post Graduate School. These studies have shown that security as well as power and jobs are key ingredients for success during SARO. One of the major conclusions is that we need to plan for SARO while we are planning for combat. These studies have also analyzed the various technologies that are needed for successfully carrying out SARO which include sensors, robotics and information management. As stated in the work by the Naval Postgraduate School, we need to determine the social, political and economic relationships between the local communities as well as determine who the important people are. One particular task during SARO is managing emergencies and crisis situations as well as carrying out humanitarian operations. In such situations, it is critical that the information between various individuals as well as agencies be shared. Furthermore, social relationships between the different parties need to be analyzed. To address the key technical challenges for emergency management and crisis response during SARO and related humanitarian efforts we are exploring assured information sharing and secure social networking to develop novel technologies to support emergency management and crisis response.","2016-05-23","2025-11-10 09:28:52","2025-11-10 09:28:52","","1813-1820","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","","","","Security; Twitter; Data privacy; Emergency services; Media; Companies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite some research on key-value query and range query in this hybrid-storage scenario, other more complicated data types are not yet supported. In this article, we conduct pioneering research on authenticated queries for graph data, which is a popular data type such as the knowledge graph data, on the blockchain-assisted cloud. The primary challenge is how to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) that supports authenticated queries and can be easily maintained by the blockchain. To this end, we propose a novel ADS, named PAGB, based on the RSA accumulator and completeness set. It can also prevent the original data from being revealed to the public through blockchain or irrelevant queries. We further optimize our design to be more efficient in terms of communication and computation. The effectiveness and efficiency of PAGB are verified through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.","2023-09-01","2025-11-10 09:28:52","2025-11-10 09:36:01","","9728-9742","","9","35","","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: B.

However, the existing RDF database engines are not scalable and are less reliable in heterogeneous clouds. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Acacia-RDF which is a scalable distributed RDF graph database engine developed with X10 programming language to solve this issue. Acacia-RDF partitions the RDF data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable SPARQL processor for Acacia-RDF which operates on top of partitioned RDF data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the implementation of scalable graph algorithms such as Triangle counting with such partitioned data sets. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of LUBM RDF benchmark data sets and make a comparison of Acacia's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-RDF scales well with LUBM data sets. Acacia-RDF reported approximately 2 seconds elapsed time on 4 places for running the first and third queries of the LUBM benchmark on LUBM scale 40 data set. Through this work we introduce the use of X10 language for scalable RDF graph data management.","2016-05-23","2025-11-10 09:28:52","2025-11-10 09:35:55","","1024-1032","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 3; Conference name: 30th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops, IPDPSW 2016; Conference location: Chicago; IL</p>","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Digital storage; Information management; Computation theory; Graph theory; Graph algorithms; Data mining; Data handling; Computer architecture; Graph database; Database systems; Benchmarking; RDF; SPARQL; Java; Design and implementations; Engines; Resource description framework; Servers; Partitioning algorithms; Benchmark data; Database management; Distributed database; Distributed databases; Graph databases; Secondary storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this problem, a new context-aware semantically extensible searchable symmetric encryption based on Word2vec model (CASE-SSE) is proposed to achieve context-aware semantic extension in this article. The proposed scheme utilizes outsourced datasets as corpora to extract all keywords for training the Word2vec model, and the trained results is the ontology knowledge base that can be used to extend the semantics of query keywords directly. Further, to facilitate multi-keyword search using the extended query vector, we use the $k$k-means clustering algorithm to classify outsourced datasets. We then construct an AVL-tree index and an inverted index based on the classified results, thereby achieving efficient context-aware semantically extensible SSE. The security analysis indicates it is secure and effective. The experimental results show that our scheme is superior in both efficiency and accuracy.","2023-04-01","2025-11-10 09:28:52","2025-11-10 09:28:52","","1011-1022","","2","16","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Searchable symmetric encryption; Semantics; Encryption; Indexes; Servers; Context modeling; Data models; Training; $k$   k     -means clustering; Context aware; Semantically extensible; Word2vec model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By leveraging IT virtualization techniques in combination with programmable networks, NFV is able to decouple network functionality from the physical devices on which they are deployed. This opens up new business opportunities for both Infrastructure Providers (InPs) as well as Service Providers (SPs), where the SP can request to deploy a chain of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on top of which its service can run. However, current NFV approaches lack the possibility for SPs to define location requirements and constraints on the mapping of virtual functions and paths onto physical hosts and links. Nevertheless, many scenarios can be envisioned in which the SP would like to attach placement constraints for efficiency, resilience, legislative, privacy and economic reasons. Therefore, we propose a set of affinity and anti-affinity constraints, which can be used by SPs to define such placement restrictions. This newfound ability to add constraints to Service Function Chain (SFC) requests also introduces an additional risk that SFCs with conflicting constraints are requested or automatically generated. Therefore, a framework is proposed that allows the InP to check the validity of a set of constraints and provide feedback to the SP. To achieve this, the SFC request and relevant information on the physical topology are modeled as an ontology of which the consistency can be checked using a semantic reasoner. Enabling semantic validation of SFC requests, eliminates inconsistent SFCs requests from being transferred to the embedding algorithm.","2016-06-06","2025-11-10 09:28:52","2025-11-10 09:28:52","","202-210","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE NetSoft Conference and Workshops (NetSoft)","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Privacy; Virtualization; III-V semiconductor materials; Indium phosphide; Resilience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE NetSoft Conference and Workshops (NetSoft)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our framework captures the key terms, measures, and deontic rules, in the form of obligations and permissions present in the cloud SLAs.

However, there are challenges about security, privacy, and compliance. Building compliant systems is difficult because of the complex nature of regulations and cloud systems. In addition, the lack of reference architectures (RAs) makes compliance even harder. RAs should be complete, precise, abstract, vendor neutral, platform independent, with no implementation details, however, their levels of detail and abstraction are still debatable and there is no accepted definition about what an RA should contain. Existing approaches used to build RAs lack structured templates and systematic procedures. In addition, most approaches do not take full advantage of patterns and best practices that promote architectural qualities such as modularity, reusability, flexibility and usability. We propose here a five-step approach to build an RA that can improve the quality of the concrete architectures derived from it and from which we can derive more specialized RAs.

This cycle is both times and works seriously. In this paper, we have attempted to review the current advancements as well as propose another framework for criminal Distinguishing & Recognition using Deep learning and Heroku Cloud i.e Cloud Computing, which assuming utilized by our Crime control Organizations would assist them with tracking down crooks from the pictures of CCTV or images uploaded by the public if seen anywhere. This system if implemented helps find criminals as well as any person can upload the information that he has seen the required person in a particular place and time. Existing arrangements utilize conventional face acknowledgement calculations which can be problematic in changing Indian conditions, particularly factors like light, climate and particular direction and there is no open public contribution.

However, the traditional classification models work poorly on short texts due to data sparsity issue. The objective of this research is to determine whether fused topic features will extend short text features and achieve better classification performance. We propose a novel short text topic classification approach and put the topic features into consideration. Firstly, LDA topic model is used to obtain short text topic features. Next, we use BiLSTM(Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory), CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) and attention mechanism to extended short text feature extraction. Finally, a SoftMax classifier is introduced to obtain the topic classification results of the short texts.

This approach of semantic model based data sharing provides extreme loose coupling among products, makes extension of information from a given product possible with zero impact on rest of the system. Easy certification of integration enables evolution of products fairly independent of each other.

To implement this approach, it is proposed to use two knowledge bases, one of which describes malfunctions, features for their identification and actions necessary to adapt to the negative consequences caused by the appearance of these malfunctions. The other database contains information about the main subsystems of the AUV, devices and replaceable modules, as well as the states they may be in. Knowledge bases are used in the work of the intelligent control-emergency system (ICES) on board the AUV, which allows for comprehensive functional diagnostics of all subsystems of the device, including payload modules, as well as adaptation to the consequences of emerging malfunctions, taking into account the actual cause-and-effect relationships between them. To test the system’s operability, a prototype was developed. The results of the prototype simulation showed that ICES performs the tasks and can be implemented on the onboard computers of existing AUV using well-known programming technologies.","2022-10-05","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","39-44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 International Conference on Ocean Studies (ICOS)","","","","ontology; Knowledge based systems; Ontologies; knowledge base; intelligent system; Simulation; Prototypes; Performance evaluation; autonomous underwater vehicle; Autonomous underwater vehicles; control-emergency system; diagnostics; Programming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 International Conference on Ocean Studies (ICOS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, many knowledge graphs are not immediately usable due to their format, unreadable or missing data, and inaccessibility. These issues present barriers to the exploration and use of knowledge graphs for big data analytics and knowledge discovery. In this paper we present a workflow for domain- and task-sensitive curation of large-scale knowledge graphs, and detail our experience with implementing this workflow with the biomedical knowledge graph called Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG). The workflow aims to address usability-related issues of real-life knowledge graphs, by performing data setup and curation that align with the needs of specific tasks and domains. Recognizing that domain experts and anticipated users of a knowledge graph provide invaluable expertise regarding the desired graph format, the proposed workflow involves them as humans-in-the-loop. We present the processes required to execute the workflow, detail our experience in the biomedical domain with the use case of DRKG, and discuss the challenges and lessons learned throughout the experience. We anticipate that the proposed workflow and experiences will be applicable to other domains, and that our workflow will enable and encourage exploration and wider use of large-scale knowledge graphs, thereby improving big data analytics.","2022-12-17","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","3692-3701","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","","","","Task analysis; Big Data; Knowledge discovery; Productivity; Usability; Drugs; data curation; Human in the loop; human-in-the-loop approaches; Improving usability and availability of knowledge graphs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysis of monitoring data delivers insights of the system's workload and usage pattern and ensures workloads are operating at optimum levels. The analysis process involves data query and extraction, data analysis, and result visualization. Since the volume of monitoring data is big, these operations require a scalable and reliable architecture to extract, aggregate, and analyze data in an arbitrary range of granularity. Ultimately, the results of analysis become the knowledge of the system and should be shared and communicated. This paper presents our cloud service architecture that explores a search cluster for data indexing and query. We develop REST APIs that the data can be accessed by different analysis modules. This architecture enables extensions to integrate with software frameworks of both batch processing (such as Hadoop) and stream processing (such as Spark) of big data. The analysis results are structured in Semantic Media Wiki pages in the context of the monitoring data source and the analysis process. This cloud architecture is empirically assessed to evaluate its responsiveness when processing a large set of data records under node failures.","2016-02","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:36:53","","55-70","","1","21","","Tsinghua Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 25; Correspondence Address: S.

In this paper, the knowledge graph with user perception is used to acquire the source of side information. We proposed KGUPN to address the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based knowledge graph-aware recommendation methods, an end-to-end framework that integrates knowledge graph and user awareness into scientific and technological news recommendation systems. KGUPN contains three main layers, which are the propagation representation layer, the contextual information layer and collaborative relation layer. The propagation representation layer improves the representation of an entity by recursively propagating embeddings from its neighbors (which can be users, news, or relationships) in the knowledge graph. The contextual information layer improves the representation of entities by encoding the behavioral information of entities appearing in the news. The collaborative relation layer complements the relationship between entities in the news knowledge graph. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that KGUPN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scientific and technological news recommendation.","2022-11-26","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","491-495","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligent Systems (CCIS)","","","","Cloud computing; Knowledge graph; Recommendation; Intelligent systems; Social networking (online); Collaboration; Encoding; Information filters; Behavioral sciences; User perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligent Systems (CCIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most existing works on encrypted search over outsourced cloud data follow the model of “one size fits all” and ignore personalized search intention. Moreover, most of them support only exact keyword search, which greatly affects data usability and user experience. So how to design a searchable encryption scheme that supports personalized search and improves user search experience remains a very challenging task. In this paper, for the first time, we study and solve the problem of personalized multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data (PRSE) while preserving privacy in cloud computing. With the help of semantic ontology WordNet, we build a user interest model for individual user by analyzing the user's search history, and adopt a scoring mechanism to express user interest smartly. To address the limitations of the model of “one size fit all” and keyword exact search, we propose two PRSE schemes for different search intentions. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate our analysis and show that our proposed solution is very efficient and effective.","2016-09-01","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:36:02","","2546-2559","","9","27","","IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 691; CODEN: ITDSE</p>","","","Cloud computing; Cloud security; Searchable encryptions; Semantics; Cloud securities; Cryptography; Search engines; Encryption; Indexes; Efficiency improvement; Personalized search; Semantic ontology; Servers; Search intentions; Encrypted searches; outsourcing security; personalized search; user interest model; User interest model; Computational modeling; Search problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing methods often failed to capture the semantic similarity for complex question answering, e.g., multi-hop and temporal constrained situations. In addition, existing KGQA related research mostly concentrates on entities while often ignores the events which contain a large portion of the world knowledge. To solve this issue, we propose a Contrastive Semantic Similarity Learning (CSSL) method for multi-hop question answering over event-centric KGs. In this method, for candidate relation chains generation, the retrieval subgraph is first constructed by identifying the topic event or entity in the question. To better accommodate complex questions, we introduce the contrastive learning framework to learn a common semantic space, where the similarity score is finally calculated to select the final answer. The experimental results on the EventQA dataset show that the proposed method achieves superior performances compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.","2022-11-26","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","360-364","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligent Systems (CCIS)","","","","Cloud computing; Learning systems; Semantics; Natural languages; Intelligent systems; Semantic similarity; Question answering (information retrieval); Contrastive learning; Event-centric knowledge graph; Multi-hop question answering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligent Systems (CCIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, it proposes a Cloud description ontology that integrates service descriptions obtained from heterogeneous sources. The ontology model accounts for the functional and non-functional properties, attributes and relations of infrastructure, platform and software services in order to facilitate the discovery and selection of suitable Cloud services.

To this end, semantic matching between the application characteristics and the individual descriptions of available compute clusters (e.g. from public or private cloud or edge facilities available) is required. In this work, such a system is proposed, namely the Reasoning Framework, which performs semantic matching between application and resource (meta)data and facilitates information sharing among the FaaS platform components leveraging Knowledge Graphs, ontology technologies, and semantic reasoning. The proposed system harvests information from the application function workflow, provided as a graph by the function editor specification (based on Node-RED), including developer-inserted annotations during the design process, and maps them to the dynamic information retrieved from the available clusters. The Reasoning Framework interprets these data as graphs and automatically applies several semantic rules that enable filtering of the available resources and efficient information retrieval through a RESTfull interface. The paper also discusses experimental results to further showcase the advantages of the proposed approach.","2022-12-13","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","91-96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom)","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontologies; knowledge graph; Information sharing; semantic matching; Knowledge engineering; reasoning; Computers; Filtering; FaaS; inference; knowledge engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, depending on online networks popularity, there are a lot of research starting to focus on patient-context to apply health care fields like tele-health, tele-care, medical traveling, and so on. The proposed eHeaRSS is like a family doctor to care patients, especially to use generated patients-context. eHeaRSS is a recommendation system for immediate and appropriate medical services using crowd sourcing in cloud computing environment. To do this, it is necessary to classify the data into symptoms, diseases, departments and doctors related data types. To consider hierarchies or subsume relationships among them, eHeaRSS Ontology (eHeaRSS-Ont) is developed through integration of 4-static ontology (4-Ont) which is comprised of symptom-, disease-, department-and doctor-Ont to create tailored recommendations depending on patient-context. For the recommendation service, Case-based reasoning (CBR) is applied. The extracted cases using 4-Ont are integrated by eHeaRSS-Ont depending on the patient-context. For customization, it is necessary to reconfigure the case using eHeaRSS Constraints Value Compatibility Map (eHeaRSS-CVCM). To prove the significance and efficiency of the eHeaRSS, we experimented using ontology-based data processing and proved the superiority of eHeaRSS with the provision of better recommendation than other DB-based systems.","2015-12-19","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:36:03","","1108-1113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart City/SocialCom/SustainCom (SmartCity)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 23; Conference name: IEEE International Conference on Smart City, SmartCity 2015; Conference location: Chengdu; Conference sponsors: IEEE; IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC)</p>","","","Cloud computing; Ontology; Recommender systems; Distributed computer systems; Knowledge based systems; Ontology-based; Ontologies; Big data; Data handling; Cloud computing environments; Health care; Healthcare; Health; Context; Cloud computing environment; Case based reasoning; Health services; Telehealth; Diseases; Hospitals; Medical services; Service systems; Case-based Reasoning; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Crowd sourcing; On-line network; Recommendation Service System","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart City/SocialCom/SustainCom (SmartCity)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It brings a revolutionary development to the software production relationship and effectively improves the scalability and stability of the system. However, as the system evolves and the microservice splitting granularity is wrefined, the scale of microservices explodes and problems such as extended service discovery time and high service maintenance costs arise. For these problems, this paper proposes a detection mesh scheme (DM) based on service mesh and service semantics, which is divided into two main parts: service registration and service discovery. In terms of the service registration, based on the idea of a service mesh, the microservice governance and microservice development are deeply decoupled. In terms of the service discovery, the local-remote algorithm is proposed by considering the path, semantics, and state of microservices. In addition, a hierarchical ontology model is builded to provide a solid foundation for service registration and service discovery. Through experimental verification, compared with the web service discovery based on the maximum weighted bipartite graphs scheme(WSDMWBG), the DM scheme improves 12.71% in first hit rate and 28.3% in total microservice call time, effectively reducing the service discovery latency.","2022-12-03","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications (NaNA)","","","","Semantics; Web services; Computer architecture; Scalability; Production; Solid modeling; Microservice architectures; microservice architecture; service governance; service mesh; service registration and discovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications (NaNA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cloud user becomes willing to accept insecure conditions and unconsciously increases these conditions' security level if he is able to find a strategy that provides trust. This level of trust, once established, is difficult to maintain if any deception takes place. The indications of proven trust can only be seen in future usage of a cloud service. For this reason, specific control instruments are required to ascertain the accuracy of one's trust. The establishment of trust in a public cloud environment requires a paradigm change: a holistic strategy that enforces regulation requirements throughout the cloud architecture. The movement of the root of trust into hardware reduces vulnerability to compromise, as hardware attacks require a high expenditure of time and effort. Cloud users would define regulation standards through trust-worthy IT instruments and enforce them in specific cloud-service layers. The extension of this approach is the regulation of SaaS-based applications to enforce requirements for separation and availability. This work introduces a conceptual approach to establish a chain of policy by using hardware-oriented root of trust. The conceptual description of a chain of policy outlines the main principles to enforce regulations accurately for each architectural cloud layer based on an established chain of trust.","2015-12-07","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:36:12","","601-606","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, UCC 2015; Conference location: Limassol; Conference sponsors: Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); IEEE Computer Society</p>","","","Cloud computing; Ontology; Distributed database systems; Security; Ontologies; Cloud architectures; Chains; Computer architecture; Trusted computing; Hardware; Reconfigurable hardware; Compliance; Conceptual approaches; Control instruments; Problematic issues; Regulation; Trusted Cloud; Trusted clouds; Vulnerability to compromise; Virtual machine monitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The function of the information management module is to take advantage of the large storage capacity of cloud computing, improve storage efficiency, and ensure the smooth progress of information transmission, storage, and backup in the system. With this theoretical basis, this paper then considers the novel decentralization algorithm. The core idea of ontology is to gradually abstract the concepts and relationships of each specific object, and to standardize and standardize the general description of concepts in the field.

Since clouds have diverse groups of users with different sets of security requirements, restricting the users' accesses and protecting information from unauthorized accesses have become the most difficult tasks. To address these critical challenges, in this paper we first formalize Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) and propose a new access control model, called Attribute-Rule ABAC (AR-ABAC), for cloud computing to meet critical access control requirements in clouds. Our model supports the attribute-rules that deal with the association between users and objects, as well as the capability for accessing objects based on their sensitivity levels. The attribute-rules specify an agreement that determines what kind of attributes should be used and the number of attributes considered for making access decisions. In addition, our model ensures secure resource sharing among potential untrusted tenants and supports different access permissions to the same user at the same session.","2015-10-27","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","28-35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","","","","Cloud computing; Access control; Computational modeling; Electronic mail; access control models; attribute based access control; cloud computing security; Permission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Issues like service discovery and selection are major obstacle in ad-hoc mobile. With the growing of this market, researchers are concentrating on service discovery with little on selection. Provision of optimal service in ad-hoc mobile is a challenge and our goal. To address this, most scholars use various algorithms. For example, the dynamic programming or greedy algorithm, but the complexity of these algorithms especially when the number of consumers and providers in the market are many poses a challenge. To tackle this, we propose Analytic Hierarchy Model (AHM). This model uses the QoS criteria as required by consumers and then systematically process it to rank the services to obtain the optimal service. Experiment is conducted using reputation and location as our criteria. The optimal service is selected based on the required QoS of the consumer.","2015-12-14","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","84-88","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 World Congress on Sustainable Technologies (WCST)","","","","Cloud computing; Heuristic algorithms; Context; Ad hoc networks; Mobile communication; Mobile handsets; Analytical models; Ad-hoc mobile market; Analytic hierarchy model; Mobile Cloud Market; Normalization; Optimal service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 World Congress on Sustainable Technologies (WCST)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the performance QoS parameters, mainly response-time and throughput could be modulated to provide very efficient services for cloud users. As per user's requirement, the service provider's recommendation of appropriate Web services to the end-users with proper QoS satisfaction is one of the critical issues. This can be recommended to end-users in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) under Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) of WS-Policy. Generally, the matrix of collected QoS parameter values is sparse and the accurate prediction of the missing QoS values is important for the recommendation of appropriate web services to the end users. To address this issue, we worked out an artificial neural network model for the prediction of missing QoS-values using past QoS performance parameter data. In this current work, the performances of different learning algorithms of ANN are analyzed for enhanced prediction of QoS performance values. The ANN model with Bayesian-Regularization is found to be better performing when compared to other learning algorithms.","2015-12-16","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:35:45","","414-419","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 International Conference on Computing and Network Communications (CoCoNet)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 14; Correspondence Address: M.K.

Many protocols, including Filecoin, Arweave, and Sia, have been proposed to provide scalable decentralized file storage for blockchain applications. However, the reliability is not well promised by existing protocols. Inspired by the idea of insurance, we innovatively propose a decentralized file storage protocol in blockchain, named as FileInsurer, to achieve both scalability and reliability. While ensuring scalability by distributed storage, FileInsurer guarantees reliability by enhancing robustness and fully compensating for the file loss. Specifically, under mild conditions, we prove that no more than 0.1% value of all files should be compensated even if half of the storage collapses. Therefore, only a relatively small deposit needs to be pledged by storage providers to cover the potential file loss. Because of lower burdens of deposit, storage providers have more incentives to participate in the storage network. FileInsurer can run in the top layer of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and thus it can be directly applied in Web 3.0, Non-Fungible Tokens, and Metaverse.","2022-07-10","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","168-179","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 IEEE 42nd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","","","","Semantic Web; Insurance; Scalability; Blockchain application; Decentralized File Storage; Decentralized System; InterPlanetary File System; Mechanism Design; Metaverse; Reliability engineering; Robustness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE 42nd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to represent access control policies as rules, and we verified the rules with an OWL-DL reasoner. Additionally, we implemented HIPAA security rules through access control policies in a cloud-based simulated healthcare environment. More specifically, we investigated access control policy specification and enforcement for cloud based healthcare information systems using an open source cloud platform, OpenStack. The results manifest HIPAA compliance through authorization policies that are capable of addressing vulnerabilities of multi-tenancy.","2015-11-03","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:36:34","","104-110","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 8; Conference name: 2nd IEEE International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing, CSCloud 2015; Conference location: New York; NY; Conference sponsors: IEEE Computer Society; IEEE TCSC; Longxiang High Tech; New York Institute of Technology (NYiT); North America Chinese Talents Association; Pace University</p>","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Open systems; Ontology; Medical computing; access control; Ontological modeling; Ontologies; Health care; Multi tenancies; Access control; Insurance; Information systems; Health; Databases; Medical services; health cloud; Health clouds; HIPAA; multitenancy; ontological model; openstack","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applying cloud systems enables healthcare users to obtain medical information from multiple cloud-based platforms or sources. Various service deployments meet different customers' needs. As one of the popular information sharing manners on clouds, Online Self-Diagnosis (OSD) has been widely implemented for recommending medicines or treatment plans in the varied medical fields. However, there is a great risk for users when executing OSD since lack of professional pharmacological knowledge. This paper concentrates on this issue and proposes an ontology-based approach representing the medical knowledge for alarming potential risks. The proposed mechanism is named Secure Ontology-based Self-diagnosis (SOS) Model that is designed to generate knowledge of medical treatments or incompatibility of medicines to avoid improper behaviors of diagnoses.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have played an important role in protecting mobile cloud security. Many techniques have been utilized to implement IDS, among them, machine learning-based techniques have generated promising results. Especially, complex deep neural networks show a higher detection rate than traditional machine learning models. However, the interpretation of the decision made by a neural network becomes harder to understand as its architectural complexity increases. This challenge makes it difficult for the human experts to fine-tune their detection systems, trust the detection system’s results, and make decisions accordingly when IDS systems are deployed. To address this issue, we propose an explainable intrusion detection framework that employs deep learning mechanisms to identify cyber-attacks and utilizes knowledge graph as the knowledge foundation to add human understanding of machine learning and explain the machine learning results. The use case study demonstrates that the proposed framework can not only successfully identify network intrusions but also effectively reveal important information about its internal working mechanisms of the mysterious deep learning Blackbox.","2022-08-15","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","25-30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 10th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering (MobileCloud)","","","","deep learning; Deep learning; knowledge graph; Neural networks; security; Predictive models; Computational modeling; Complexity theory; Cloud computing security; Network intrusion detection; Explainable AI; Intrusion Detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 10th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering (MobileCloud)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional service discovery approaches are often supported by centralized registries that could suffer from single point failure, performance bottleneck, and scalability issues in large scale systems. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a context-aware service discovery and selection approach in a decentralized peer-to-peer environment. In the approach homophily similarity was used for bootstrapping and distribution of nodes. The discovery process is based on the similarity of nodes, previous interaction and behaviour of the nodes, which will help the discovery process in a dynamic environment. Our approach is not only considering service discovery, but also the selection of the best available web service by taking into account the QoS properties of the web services. Experimental results were based on real world semantic web service dataset, the results showed that the approach achieved better performance and efficiency in both discovery and selection processes.","2015-10-26","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","2224-2231","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology; Ubiquitous Computing and Communications; Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing; Pervasive Intelligence and Computing","","","","Cloud computing; Quality of service; Quality of Service (QoS); Peer-to-peer computing; Scalability; Service-oriented architecture; context-aware service discovery; Context-aware services; decentralized environment; Partial matching; Web service selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology; Ubiquitous Computing and Communications; Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing; Pervasive Intelligence and Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regulatory and standards bodies such as Payment Card Industry (PCI), Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and others govern the minimal set of cybersecurity controls that an organization must implement. To meet such requirements while maintaining business agility, organizations need to modernize from manual document based compliance management to automated processes for continuous compliance. This modernized process is called compliance-as-code. In this paper, we present an architecture for compliance-as-code based on a standardized framework.

The framework defines a functional infrastructure of cloud-based services that facilitate integration, analysis, and data visualization. These services can be either end-user applications or services intended as a platform for creating new services. To design the framework’s architecture, we applied a top-down and bottom-up approach.

We then used this initial architecture to develop different applications, and based on the experience and insights gained and new requirements that were faced, the architecture was revised in an iterative process.

One of the major benefits of using EHR systems is assisting physicians to gain patients' healthcare information and shorten the process of the medical decision making. However, physicians' inputs still have a great impact on making decisions that cannot be checked by EHR systems. This consequence can be influenced by human behaviors or physicians' knowledge structures. An efficient approach of alerting to the unusual decisions is an urgent requirement for current EHR systems. This paper proposes a schema using ontology in big data to generate an alerting mechanism to assist physicians to make a proper medical diagnosis.

How to effectively achieve rapid deployment and management of cloud application configuration information has become one of the main challenges that restrict the stable and reliable operation of cloud applications. Therefore, this paper studies the configuration information management technology of distributed cloud platform, and proposes a set of cloud platform configuration information management technology solutions that can sense the host configuration status in real time, standardize the expression and management of configuration information categories, and visually analyze the configuration information situation, which can effectively solve the above problems and improve the high reliability of cloud applications.","2022-06-17","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:28:53","","781-784","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 IEEE 10th Joint International Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC)","","","","Cloud computing; Ontologies; Conferences; Real-time systems; Reliability engineering; Systematics; cloud platform; configuration management; Configuration management; Zookeeper","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE 10th Joint International Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Access Control is one of the traditional and essential security tools of data protection. The decision to grant access to a resource must ensure secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In particular, the challenge is more important with public clouds as many governing authorities could be involved in one cloud scenario. This implies a difficulty to work out which regulation should be applicable in case of conflict. In recent years, many access control models were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their security policies specification and enforcement. In this paper, we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies for the context of public cloud. Throughout the use of ontology tools, we propose an approach for checking privacy enforcement with access control conditions. We also suggest the use of privacy safeguards notification where the threat to privacy protection is related to the secondary usage of personal data more than just the data access itself.","2015-06-02","2025-11-10 09:28:53","2025-11-10 09:36:27","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 International Conference on Cloud Technologies and Applications (CloudTech)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technologies and Applications, CloudTech 2015; Conference location: Marrakech</p>","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Ontology; semantic web; ontology; access control; Information management; Security systems; data management; privacy; Data protection; Security policy; Data privacy; Privacy; Access control; Public clouds; Laws and legislation; Security and privacy; Security of data; Access control policies; Access control models; Privacy enforcement; Privacy requirements; Compliance control; Legislative pressures; law enforcement; Law enforcement; public Cloud; security policies; Organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 International Conference on Cloud Technologies and Applications (CloudTech)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing methods have either scalability issues by requiring that patients grant access to their medical data or a trust issue by having a single authority, thereby creating the problem of a single point of attack. Hence there is a need to develop an EHR system that addresses these bottlenecks for safe, secure, and easy cloud-based EHR management. To address these bottlenecks, we have developed a novel framework that allows policy-based multi-authority access permission to Electronic Health Record systems used by multiple care providers from various places or organizations. This framework, residing on the Edge, has been built using the Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA-ABE) and Semantic Web technologies to provide a safe, semantically rich approach to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations who manage different attributes of end-users using a shared dataset.

In cloud computing, the unique characteristics in cloud services such as dynamic and diverse services offered at different levels, together with the lack of standardized description languages pose significant challenges for effective cloud service discovery. In this paper, we propose a cloud service search engine that exploits a novel ontology-based technique for identifying cloud service categories to improve the accuracy of cloud services searching in real environments. Our approach has the capability to automatically identify and categorize cloud services by detecting cloud service concepts from cloud service sources. Initially, we focus on building the cloud service ontology by using NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology). Then, we utilize our cloud service categorization method to investigate cloud service ontology's concepts in a real-world cloud services dataset which contains the metadata of 5,883 real cloud services. After that, we generate cloud service clusters by using cosine similarity to build the cloud service categorization. Our cloud service categorization is helpful in determining whether a given web source is a cloud service. Furthermore, the new web resource which has been categorized as a cloud service can be used to boost knowledge of cloud service categorization cumulatively. The proposed approach is validated by using real-world cloud services available on the World Wide Web and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in cloud service discovery.","2015-09-21","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:35:39","","151-158","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE 19th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 28; Conference name: 19th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshps and Demonstrations, EDOCW 2015; Conference location: Adelaide; SA; Conference sponsors: IEEE Communications Society; IEEE Computer Society</p>","","","Cloud computing; Ontology; ontology; Cloud services; Distributed database systems; Ontologies; Service discovery; Web services; Computing paradigm; taxonomy; Taxonomies; Cloud service; Search engines; Websites; Platform as a service; NIST; web service; Cosine similarity; World Wide Web; On-demand computing; Software as a service; service discovery; Categorization methods; Description languages; National Institute of Standards and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 19th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasing availability of genomic data, traditional bioinformatic tools require substantial computational time and the creation of ever-larger indices each time a researcher seeks to gain insight from the data. To address these challenges, we pre-computed important relationships between biological entities spanning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and captured this information in a relational database. The database can be queried across hundreds of millions of entities and returns results in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. In this paper, we describe Functional Genomics Platform (formerly known as OMXWare), a comprehensive database relating genotype to phenotype for bacterial life. Continually updated, the Functional Genomics Platform today contains data derived from 200,000 curated, self-consistently assembled genomes. The database stores functional data for over 68 million genes, 52 million proteins, and 239 million domains with associated biological activity annotations from Gene Ontology, KEGG, MetaCyc, and Reactome. The Functional Genomics Platform maps all of the many-to-many connections between each biological entity including the originating genome, gene, protein, and protein domain. Various microbial studies, from infectious disease to environmental health, can benefit from the rich data and connections.

From a functional point of view, having the possibility to describe complete Data Mining services is fundamental to maintain the usability and especially the portability of these services independently of the software/hardware support or even the differences between cloud platforms. The main objective of this article is to design a Data Mining service definition which allows to compose with a single and simple definition a complete service, in such way a data mining workflow can be ported and deployed in different providers or even in a Market Place of this type of ready-to-consume services. This article presents a semantic scheme for the definition and description of complete Data Mining services considering both the management of the service by the provider (price, authentication, Service Level Agreement, ...) and the definition of the Data Mining workflow as a service. It represents a solid contribution for paving the way to the standardization and industrialization of Data Mining services.

Based on analysis, conversion, extraction and refinement for the big data, a disease can be prevented and group behavior can be predicted. However, each user's private data is also an element in big data. Users must provide private data to the service providers to meet their functional requirements. To gain economic benefits, some SaaS service providers have not been authorized to collect and analyze the user's sensitive private data, as a result, the user's private data is disclosed. In this paper, we propose a private data chain disclosure discovery method, to prevent a user's sensitive privacy information from being illegally disclosed. First, we measure the similarity degree and cost of the disclosure of the private data. Second, according to the similarity degree and cost of disclosure, the disclosure chain and key private data are detected in the process of interaction between user and SaaS service. Third, we propose a discovery framework for the private data chain and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness by experiments.","2022-02-01","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:35:38","","59-68","","1","15","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: C.

To address the issues that translation-based methods in handling the complex relations and symmetric relations of knowledge graph completion task, a new knowledge graph completion method via bidirectional translation and interaction called BI-TransE is proposed in this paper. First, BI-TransE embeds the entities and relations of triples into low dimensional vectors. Then, BI-TransE models the complex relations, such as 1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N, through the interaction between entities and relations, and models symmetric and inverse relations leveraging bidirectional translation score function. We evaluate our BI-TransE for knowledge graph link prediction task.

However, in the current grid dispatching system, the data needed for dispatching decision is stored in different systems, which has the characteristics of decentralized, multi-source and heterogeneous. Existing data architectures are difficult to break down the data barriers between different systems, so they cannot efficiently retrieve the required dispatching data. To meet the needs of integration and aggregation of power grid multi-source heterogeneous dispatching messages, a big data platform for power grid multi-source dispatching messages based on improved ontology aggregation is proposed.

On one hand, for the data safety purpose, the wheel manufacturing data are maintained in the private cloud and protected by an authority module. On the other hand, for the computation scalability purpose, the workers which are virtual machines equipped with the wheel manufacturing software are deployed in the public cloud. When a manufacturing job is issued by a user, the job request would be divided into certain manufacturing task requests which are then send to workers through the bulletin board storage. Such the bulletin board storage is designed to exchange data between the public cloud and the private cloud without knowing any cloud information for cloud manufacturing modules, and thus, the burdens of developing manufacturing system are greatly reduced in the hybrid-cloud environment. Finally, we deploy the HC-WMS to a composition of a public cloud, namely Windows Azure, and a private cloud built by using VMWare, and apply the HC-WMS to a wheel manufacturing factory for conducting integrated tests.

However, many cloud computing providers offer their cloud resources according to their own rules. The descriptions of various cloud resources also differ for each vendor. Subsequently, it becomes difficult to find suitable cloud resources given the characteristics of an application. Scientists therefore, select resources used in previous experiments or best performance resources without considering the characteristics of their applications. There is the need to standardize notations to support simple selection of cloud resources without the constraints of providers. Intercloud can use cloud resources without considering cloud providers in hybrid cloud environments. Intercloud project has been studied for interoperability and creates mOSAIC ontology to conceptualize various resources. However, the mOSAIC ontology attributes are limited when considering characteristics of an application. We propose a semantic engine to provide semantic cloud resource services in intercloud environment. We define a rule of categorized resource description with reference to mOSAIC ontology attributes which includes added factors needed to represent application characteristics.

There is a growing concern around the security and privacy of data in such large-scale shared architectures. Most organizations have a human-written privacy policy that discloses all the ways that data is shared, stored, and used. The organizational privacy policies must also be compliant with government and administrative regulations. This raises a major challenge for providers as they try to launch new services. Thus they are moving towards a system of automatic policy maintenance and regulatory compliance. This requires extracting policy from text documents and representing it in a semi-structured, machine-processable framework. The most popular method to this end is extracting policy information into a Knowledge Graph (KG). There exists a significant body of work that converts text descriptions of regulations into policies expressed in languages such as OWL and XACML and is grounded in the control-based schema by using NLP approaches. In this paper, we show that the NLP-based approaches to extract knowledge from written policy documents and representing them in enforceable Knowledge Graphs fail when the text policies are ambiguous. Ambiguity can arise from lack of clarity, misuse of syntax, and/or the use of complex language. We describe a system to extract features from a policy document that affect its ambiguity and classify the documents based on the level of ambiguity present. We validate this approach using human annotators. We show that a large number of documents in a popular privacy policy corpus (OPP-115) are ambiguous. This affects the ability to automatically monitor privacy policies. We show that for policies that are more ambiguous according to our proposed measure, NLP-based text segment classifiers are less accurate.","2021-10-30","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","1491-1500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)","","","","knowledge graph; Data privacy; Syntactics; Privacy; OWL; Feature extraction; Maintenance engineering; ambiguity; knowledge extraction; policy maintenance; privacy policy; Text analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, it is expected that the definitions of Industrial Processes become even broader. Outsourcing industrial processes is a common practice and also strategy weapon for many companies to reduce costs and enhance the utilization of internal resources forming core competencies. This paper presents the concept of an industrial product-service system for oil sands mining (om-iPSS) based on the utility enhancement of oil sands mining systems. The intelligent technologies such as the cloud computing are proposed as embedding knowledge in the outsourcing-oriented om-iPSS for the whole life cycle of production process. As a result, the om-iPSS with advanced characteristics such as distributed, intelligence, adaptation and self-organization is developed in which a novel approach for enabling individualized and highly-customized production is proposed. Architecture is proposed to enable the om-iPSS from the aspects of both hardware and software. Key techniques for implementing the architecture are discussed for illustrating the use of the om-iPSS concept.","2015-08-02","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","1362-1367","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","","","","Monitoring; Data mining; Computer architecture; Production; Hydrocarbons; industrial process; industrial product service system; Maintenance engineering; oil sands mining system; service; system engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, when organizations are under great pressure from competitive market and changes in the environment, the capability of changing its own processes through digital transformation paradigm will play the main role in sustaining the organization's position on the market. Although digital transformation is a contemporary term, it covers the usage of existing methods from different areas like business processes, management by measurement, organizational culture etc. The way we see business processes is usually through process models. Regardless the notification we use, these models help in understanding the way organization does its business and are the basis for the work optimization/redesign, activity-based costing analysis, or the development of information system's architecture.

The framework utilizes service migration between devices acting as Web service providers to increase the adaptability of SOA in a mobile environment. It allows an automatic discovery of new providers and their services joining a system and extraction of their context, preferences, and rules for a Web service migration ontology. If the preferences and the rules, which specify requirements of each provider to its hosted services and requirements of the services to be hosted by a provider, do not meet the current status and context of providers or services, the framework initiates a Web service migration. In this case, the ontology is added to a core domain model and reasoned together by Jena reasoners to retrieve a set of alternate migration decisions. These are processed by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) decision-making method to find the best possible Web service migrations which modify the status and context of providers and services to better meet their preferences and rules. By the Web service migration, the framework extends significantly the adaptability of SOA systems and helps to keep a required quality of their services (QoS).","2015-07-27","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","423-430","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services","","","","Analytic hierarchy process; Quality of service; Web service; Context; Context modeling; devices profile for Web services; service migration; service-oriented architecture; Web service discovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When a user instructs to all heterogeneous service Robots with high level instructions who are working at different locations in smart house, all robots need to operate by understanding the semantic of the instruction and complete the task uniformly without considering underline software and hardware implementations. Ontology is used to extract the semantic meaning of the instructions. Each robot is assigned a specific task for specific time period for each day. User can issue commands to all robots at different time slots but the same command can be issued with different sentence by different users. We have used ontology to represents the semantic of the sentence with different commands. We have used three robots (TurtleBot, TiaGo and Husky) for our experiment in Gazebo simulator. Robot Operating System (ROS) is the middleware which is hiding more complex implementation of different functions for different robots and provide the interoperability for heterogeneous robot operations.

Searching becomes still more difficult when user wishes to search a service using its functional properties. The cloud service discovery methods enable users to discover the cloud services based on the user demand. Cloud service discovery is considered as one of the important research areas because of different types and features of cloud providers, their own naming conventions and descriptions. The results of the discovery process can be improved by using a well defined repository. To improve the effectiveness of the discovery, cloud repository requires a good structure to represent the information regarding a cloud service.

In remote places, and in emergency situations, there is scarcity of medical personnel and proper medical infrastructure. Hand held devices like smart phones and other devices having sensing capabilities can be used to store health data in cloud. This health data containing audio, video, images, sensor data as well as text data can be easily stored in a cloud. A static data model does not have the capability to cope with changes in the requirements of a health care application. Ontology comes as a solution to incorporate the dynamic requirements of such an application. Also, there are multiple complicated health data standards to follow or to be interoperable with. Ontology has the capacity to bring different health data standards and relate these standards. Health data being Big data by its nature is stored in MongoDB cloud in this work. Designing a data model that stores health data so that queries can run in less time- is a challenge. An algorithm is used to generate the data model design for a set of queries.

A form of its implementation is the use of e-learning. However, in practice there are still some obstacles, such as learning resources are not evenly distributed, limited access to services provided, qualified educators resources are concentrated in specific areas. This led to the emergence of disparities educational process, and technology gap due to differences in ICT infrastructure owned by any educational institution. Therefore this study proposes architecture of cloud-based open learning to solve these problems. The term open learning is used in order to encouraging the development of the concept of Indonesia Open Educational Resources (IOER) and as well as the adoption of concept of cloud computing. There are several phase that we conducted in this research such as analysis, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation phase. The design of the proposed architecture consists of six layers: (1) Infrastructure, (2) Platform, (3) Application, (4) Service, (5) Access, (6) User. As a result of the implementation from this architecture is a prototype of Indonesia - Virtual Open Learning System (iVOLS). In experiment, personalization e-learning runs as a service that need large storage and other shared facilities to conduct the program so the system can delivered different learning materials to different learners. The e-learning personalization in cloud environment classified successful if the learners got the best performance on learning and it shown by their evaluation score. Based on the test results and evaluation showed that the availability on Cloud-Based Open Learning further meet user needs. This is indicated by the presence of a simple infrastructure services, application services with just one stage and the availability of a wider range of data and the resource sharing. In accessibility, Cloud-Based Open Learning provides easy access to the user. By economically, the result of evaluation showed that Cloud-Based Open Learning has an investment of 35.61% efficiency, increase Return On Investment (ROI) of 60.95% and Net Present Value (NPV) of 81.97% from the user's perspective.

Since the attributes of the Users will change with time, the encryption policies adopted may also vary. For large EHR systems, it is often necessary to search through the encrypted data in realtime and perform client-side computations without decrypting all patient records. This paper describes our novel cloud-based EHR system that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) combined with Semantic Web technologies to facilitate differential access to an EHR, thereby ensuring only Users with valid attributes can access a particular field of the EHR. The system also includes searchable encryption using keyword index and search trapdoor, which allows querying EHR fields without decrypting the entire patient record. The attribute revocation feature is efficiently managed in our EHR by delegating the revision of the secret key and ciphertext to the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). Our methodology incorporates advanced security features that eliminate malicious use of EHR data and contributes significantly towards ensuring secure digital health systems on the Cloud.","2021-09-05","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:35:28","","38-47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Digital Health (ICDH)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 5; Conference name: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Digital Health, ICDH 2021; Conference location: Virtual, Online; Conference sponsors: IEEE Computer Society</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud-computing; Semantic Web; Knowledge graph; Knowledge graphs; Searchable encryptions; Semantics; Cloud-based; Cloud securities; Ontology's; Knowledge graph (ontology); Attribute Revocation; Cloud Security; Cryptography; Search engines; Privacy; Encryption; Access control; Attribute revocation; Knowledge Graph (Ontology); Records management; eHealth; Electronic document exchange; Cloud data security; Electronic Health Record; Patient record; Searchable Encryption; Semantic access; Organizations; Electronic healthcare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE International Conference on Digital Health (ICDH)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large amount of Resource Description Framework (RDF) data was published in publicly available datasets and connected to create the so-called Linked Open Data cloud. The semantics embedded in the Linked Open Data (LOD) can be utilized to enhance the recommender systems (RSs). Limited content analysis, cold-start and data sparsity are well-known issues in traditional RSs, which occurs when few or no features describe the items or no ratings to achieve a recommendation task. Because the LOD cloud contains many features, the knowledge encoded can help resolve this issue. The proposed system's main idea is to design a knowledge-based recommendation system that uses semantic features extracted from multiple datasets in LOD. Our approach will generate recommendations depending on direct and indirect relationships between resources. The results will be ranked according to their similarity score with the input before presenting them to the user. The results of our approach were comparable to the results of the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) website. Furthermore, an experimental evaluation using the MovieLens dataset was conducted. The results were encouraging and stimulating further research in this particular field of study. The usage of different kinds of relations in LOD can enhance the accuracy of the recommendations.","2021-04-28","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","98-103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 1st Babylon International Conference on Information Technology and Science (BICITS)","","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Semantics; Feature extraction; DBpedia; RDF; SPARQL; Resource description framework; Motion pictures; Linked Open Data; Vocabulary; FOAF; LinkedMDB; Recommender Systems; Web sites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 1st Babylon International Conference on Information Technology and Science (BICITS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The available approaches to perform this task are basically either services derived from alliances of major software vendors and Cloud providers focusing on their own products, or small platform providers focusing on the most popular software stacks. For migrating other types of software, the options are limited to Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions which require a lot of programming effort for adapting the software to a Cloud provider's API. Moreover, if it must be deployed in different providers, new integration procedures must be designed and implemented which could be a nightmare.

Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology.","2015-07-27","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:36:39","","1081-1084","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 55; Conference name: 8th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing, CLOUD 2015; Conference location: New York; NY; Conference sponsors: IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Services Computing (TC-SVC); Services Society (SS)</p>","","","Cloud computing; Cloud security; Semantics; Cloud securities; cloud security; Distributed database systems; Security; Ontologies; Web services; Security measure; Security systems; Semantic approach; NIST; Security controls; Security and privacy; Cloud security models; Security compliance models; Compliance control; Potential threats; Security compliance; Security threats; ISO Standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present, HIPAA rules are available only in large textual format and require significant human effort to implement in the Health IT systems. Moreover, every change in the regulation, like the recent relaxation in telehealth policy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has to be manually implemented in the IT system. We have developed a semantically rich Knowledge graph, using Semantic Web technologies to represent HIPAA rules in a machine-processable format. This will significantly help in automatically reasoning of HIPAA policies. In this paper, we describe our design along with the results of our study of the current status of research on HIPAA ontology.

BPaaS providers may look for available business processes from other cloud providers to improve their processes. However, today's BPaaS solutions lack an explicit and formal semantics which prevent an easy and dynamic interoperability between different cloud providers. In this paper, we propose firstly to semantically populate a shared knowledge base of process models deployed by BPaaS providers. Therefore, using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve similar process fragments that can be used to design new process variants. We also performed experiments on large public datasets and experimental results show that our approach is feasible and efficient.","2015-07-27","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:35:24","","712-719","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 4; Conference name: IEEE International Conference on Services Computing, SCC 2015; Conference location: New York; NY; Conference sponsors: Huawei; IBM Research; IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Services Computing (TC-SVC); Services Society (SS)</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontology; Knowledge based systems; Ontologies; Semantic technologies; Formal Semantics; Context; Business Process; Formal methods; Semantic technology; Business Process as a Service (BPaaS); Business process outsourcing; Dynamic interoperability; Ordering constraints; Process designers; Process Fragment; Process Fragments; Business; Unified modeling language; Computational modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we define use case to add current user information from one platform as a service offer to the application hosted on another offer. To address interoperability problems, the ontology driven data mediation will be used and tested in this use case. Remote vendors' APIs are implemented as web services. Resulting web operations and their inputs/outputs are semantically annotated using cross-PaaS concepts from the developed platform as a service OWL ontology. Next, SAWSDL and XSLT are used to define service type mappings. Actual composition of platform as a service APIs is implemented by means of AI planner and developed Java web application.

However, current proposals to model service level agreements are mostly focused on technical aspects, do not explicitly provide semantics to agreement terms, and do not follow Web principles. These limitations prevent take-up, automatic processing, and effective sharing of agreements. Linked USDL Agreement is a Linked Data based semantic model to describe and share service agreements that extends Linked USDL, which offers a family of languages to describe various technical and business aspects of services. We followed a use case driven approach, evaluating the applicability of our proposal in a cloud computing scenario, and comparing its expressiveness with existing models.

During the years Cloud systems became more and more complex. The main idea is that all Cloud components offer their functions as a service. For this reason Cloud systems inherits many features from old Web Services and Service Oriented architectures. At the moment, the need for composition and automation of Cloud services is a hot research field. Orchestration is one of the topics that researchers are investigating. Unlike web services, it is not clear what orchestration means in Cloud Systems. It usually addresses automation, but no clear definitions and languages have been provided. Another hot topic regarding composition of cloud services is the definition of design, architectural and communication Patterns for solving well known and common problems. In this work we will show how Orchestration and some Patterns are tightly coupled. We will describe a methodology for definition of orchestrated workflows which exploits some common Cloud Design Patterns in order to verify composition soundness. In addition we will show how this methodology can be used to verify some requirements on the composed Cloud services. The whole methodology is based both on formal semantics definition of an Orchestration language, and on the use of Ontologies for the description of Cloud services interactions.","2015-07-08","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:35:59","","192-199","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 Ninth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: F.

A number of previous proposals have addressed resource allocation for IaaS services with bandwidth guarantee as the main obstacle to accessing datacenter-based cloud resources. Less focus has been put on utilization of hosting resources, i.e. computing and storage. Shortcomings with these proposals (i) may ensue in a high blocking of IaaS requests and (ii) a less efficient use of datacenter resources, which may impact a provider's revenue. In this research paper, a Two-Phase IaaS resource allocation approach (2P-IaaS) is proposed to address these shortcomings: (i) hosting resources mapping phase, and (ii) connectivity composition phase. This approach adopts a semantic ontology model with its associated reasoning capabilities to represent, discover and assign diverse cloud resources to IaaS requests. Furthermore, the proposed approach utilizes semantic similarity and closeness centrality to define an efficient cloud IaaS topology that connects the assigned resources. In this research, experiments on various sets of IaaS requests show significant advantages when compared with selected benchmarks.","2015-01-09","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","790-795","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 12th Annual IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)","","","","Semantics; Ontologies; Resource management; Bandwidth; Resource Management; Ontology Reasoning; Cognition; Proposals; Computational modeling; Closeness Centrality; Infrastructure-as-a-Service; Resource Allocation; Semantic Similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 12th Annual IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing authorization models follow a patient-centric approach for EHR management, where the responsibility of authorizing data access is handled at the patients end. This creates a significant overhead for the patient who must authorize every access of their health record. This is not practical given that multiple personnel are typically involved in providing care and that the patient may not always be in a state to provide this authorization. Hence there is a need to develop a proper authorization delegation mechanism for safe, secure and easy to use cloud-based EHR Service management. We present a novel, centralized, attribute-based authorization mechanism that uses Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and allows for delegated secure access of patient records. This mechanism transfers the service management overhead from the patient to the medical organization and allows easy delegation of cloud-based EHRs access authority to medical providers.","2021-12-01","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:35:06","","1612-1623","","6","14","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: M.

In the field of advanced manufacturing however, the impact has been significantly lesser than expected due to limitations in cloud platforms for fostering community engagement. To address this problem, we study a new cloud-based architecture that provides Platform-asa-Service (PaaS) management capabilities to the manufacturing community for delivering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) “Apps” to their customers. Our architecture aims at supporting an “App Marketplace” that thrives on agile development, organic collaboration and scalable sales of next generation manufacturing Apps requiring high-performance simulation and modeling. Towards realizing the vision of the above architecture, our paper involves investigation and implementation of an Ontology Service that interoperates with other common web services related to resource brokering and accounting. Our Ontology Service uses principles of mapping and merging to translate a manufacturing App's collaboration requirements to suitable resource specifications on public cloud platforms. Integrated resultant ontology can be queried to provision the required resource parameters such as amount of memory/storage, number of processing units, and network protocol configurations needed for deployment of an App. We validate the effectiveness of our Ontology Service using the Protégé framework in a pilot testbed of a real-world “WheelSim” App in the NSF GENI Cloud platform. Our ontology integration results show benefits to an App developer in terms of: optimal user experience, lower design time and lower cost/simulation.","2015-05-11","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:35:40","","504-510","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 6; Conference name: 14th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management, IM 2015; Conference location: Ottawa; ON; Shaw Centre</p>","","","Cloud computing; Ontology; Commerce; Ontologies; Web services; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Sales; Software as a service (SaaS); Computer architecture; Network architecture; Manufacture; User experience; Network protocols; Collaboration; Cloud managements; Network management; Advanced manufacturing; Advanced Manufacturing; App Marketplace; Cloud computing and networkings; Cloud-based architectures; High-performance simulation; Integrated Cloud Management; Management capabilities; Network protocol configuration; Ontology Service; Ontology services; Random access memory; Manufacturing; Communities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve the scalability and the performance of triple query, which is called SPARQL query processing, Map Reduce programming model and NoSQL database system such as H Base are well-known solutions for large scale data processing. However, in general case, the subject of a triple is regarded as Row Key in the table. In some queries, finding matched triple patterns is a time-consuming job.

With a holistic perspective to web content semantic annotation, this paper focuses on leveraging cloud computing for these challenges. To achieve this, a set of requirements towards holistic semantic annotation on the web is defined and mapped with cloud computing mechanisms to facilitate them. Technical specification for the requirements is critically reviewed and examined against each of the cloud computing mechanisms, in relation to their technical functionalities. Hence, a mapping is established if the cloud computing mechanism’s functionalities proffer a solution for implementation of a requirement’s technical specification. The result is a cloud computing capability model for holistic semantic annotation which presents an approach towards delivering large-scale semantic annotation on the web via a cloud platform.","2020-12-14","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:36:53","","335-340","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2020 13th International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering (DeSE)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 13th International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering, DeSE 2020; Conference location: Virtual, Liverpool</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud platforms; Context- awareness; Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Semantics; Semantic technologies; Semantic annotations; Websites; Specifications; Cloud Capability Model; Cloud Computing Mechanisms; Holistic perspectives; Semantic Annotation; Technical functionalities; Technical specifications; Web content semantics; Scalability; Semantic technology; Computational modeling; Annotations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 13th International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering (DeSE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these records cannot be queried without decrypting the entire record. This incurs a huge amount of burden in network bandwidth and the client-side computation. As the volume of cloud-based EHRs reaches Big Data levels, it is essential to search over these encrypted patient records without decrypting them to ensure that the medical caregivers can efficiently access the EHRs. This is especially critical if the caregivers have access to only certain sections of the patient EHR and should not decrypt the whole record. In this paper, we present our novel approach that facilitates searchable encryption of large EHR systems using Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) and multi-keyword search techniques. Our framework outsources key search features to the cloud side. This way, our system can perform keyword searches on encrypted data with significantly reduced costs of network bandwidth and client-side computation.","2020-12-10","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:36:14","","4075-4082","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 12; Conference name: 8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2020; Conference location: Virtual, Online; Conference sponsors: Ankura TM; IBM; IEEE; IEEE Computer Society</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud-computing; Knowledge graph; Knowledge graphs; Searchable encryptions; Attribute based access control; Cloud securities; Ontology's; Ontologies; Electronic health record; Knowledge graph (ontology); Cloud Security; Electronic health; Health records; Big Data; Cryptography; Search engines; Encryption; Access control; Attribute-based encryptions; Hospital data processing; Knowledge Graph (Ontology); Records management; eHealth; Electronic document exchange; Searchable Encryption; Attribute Based Access Control; Attribute Based Encryption; Bandwidth; Electronic health Record; Medical services; Organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Huge amount of agriculture related data like weather data, soil health records, cropping pattern, location specific crop disease and pest are collected from different sources like services, remote satellites, and network of sensors. An agro advisory system presented in this paper helps to bridge the gap between farmers and the agriculture domain experts and developed for the cotton farmers in Gujarat region of India. The system consists of three basic components; Cotton Ontology, Web Services, and Mobile Application Development. The cotton ontology maintains domain knowledge required for answering farmer queries. The ontology contains information regarding crop, soil, cultivation process, disease, pest, and other relevant information. Protégé ontology development tool is used to develop this ontology. Appropriate Web services were built which help interactions with different data sources. The RESTful Web services are programmed in Java using the JAX-RS/Jersey API and the Eclipse EE IDE. The services are developed and deployed on a cloud based application server provided by Heroku. The Web services are invoked from the mobile device and in turn they connect to various data sources like Open Weather API, SQL database and the Ontologies.

Currently, the capability of discovering a SaaS of interest online across multiple cloud providers and reviews websites is a significant challenge, especially when using general search mechanisms (Google and Yahoo!) and search tools provided by existing reviews and directories. Discovering a SaaS is time-consuming, requiring consumers to browse several websites to select the appropriate service. This paper addresses the issues related to the efficient discovery of SaaS across review websites by developing the SaaS Nutch Hadoop-based Crawler Engine - SaaS Nhbased Crawler. The crawler is capable of crawling cloud reviews to find SaaSs of interest and enable the establishment of a central repository that could be used to discover SaaSs much more efficiently.

In this paper we propose an ontology-based model to represent the information disclosed in the agreement to turn it into a means that allows software tools to use and further process that information for different purposes, including automated service offering discovery and comparison. A specific usage of the PLA ontology is presented, showing how to link high level policies to operational policies that are then enforced and monitored. Through this established link, cloud users gain greater assurance that what is expressed in such agreements is actually being met, and thereby can take this information into account when choosing cloud service providers. Furthermore, the created link can be used to enable policy enforcement tools to add semantics to the evidence they produce; this mainly takes the form of logs that are associated with the specific policy of which execution they provide evidence. Furthermore, the use of the ontology model allows a means of enabling interoperability among tools that are in charge of the enforcement and monitoring of possible violations to the terms of the agreement.","2015-03-09","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","422-427","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering","","","","Monitoring; Ontologies; Data privacy; Privacy; Engines; Data models; privacy policy; assurance; policy enforcement; Privacy Level Agreement; Programmable logic arrays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, nowadays we target to move ocean data management toward the FAIR principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. However, the data produced and managed by different organizations with wide diversity, various structures and increasing volume make it hard to be FAIR, and one of the most critical reason is the lack of unified data representation and publication methods. In this paper, we propose novel techniques to try to solve the problem by introducing semantics with ontologies. Specifically, we first propose a unified semantic model named OEDO to represent ocean data by defining the concepts of ocean observing field, specifying the relations between the concepts, and describing the properties with ocean metadata. Then, we further optimize the state-of-the-art quick service query list (QSQL) data structure, by extending the domain concepts with WordNet to improve data discovery. Moreover, based on the OEDO model and the optimized QSQL, we propose an ocean data service publishing method called DOLP to improve data discovery and data access. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposals.","2020-11-07","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","30-37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","","","","Semantics; Publishing; ontology; Ontologies; Service computing; Proposals; Sensors; semantic representation; Oceans; data service; FAIR; ocean data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similar to the situation with service providers in the 1980th, it becomes apparent that different Cloud providers build walled gardens around their offerings. While multiple projects and organizations are working on standards for federating Cloud domains, the scalable exchange of descriptions about heterogeneous resources are often not well considered. Our approach is to adopt both, ideas initially developed for the Internet to define a scalable architecture and concepts from the Semantic Web to define a canonical Intercloud ontology. An initial implementation of the architecture has been developed to form a basis for further refinement of the proposed concepts. As a result, we have defined an initial ontology for Intercloud resources and implemented a catalog for the IEEE Intercloud architecture.","2015-03-09","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:34:53","","458-464","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 18; Conference name: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2015; Conference location: Tempe; AZ; Conference sponsors: et al.; IEEE Cloud Computing; IEEE Computer Society; LG Electronics; STC Cloud Computing; TCBIS</p>","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Multiple projects; Semantics; Ontology; ontology; Ontologies; Computer architecture; Service provider; Resource description framework; Standards; Heterogeneous resources; Federation; Resource description; Semantic resources; Scalable architectures; Resource catalogue; Pricing; federation; resource description","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of ""Production as a Service"" (PaaS) focuses on small lot sizes and personalized products and thus can resolve looking for manufacturers, linking the demand and the issue of underutilized equipment of manufacturers and product designers supply side. In this paper a system architecture is developed which enables the dynamic generation of alternative process chains in the context of PaaS using the C4 Model notation for visualization. The system architecture is based on a service-oriented architecture (SoA). The core of the architecture is building upon the Product, Process and Resource Model used to describe the manufacturing capabilities optimized to meet customer and market requirements. The development is based on the existing work on Production as a Service and the generation of alternative process chains outlined in the state of the art. Future research should be a detailed description of the process of matching products and resources. Additionally, a prototypical implementation is needed to evaluate the application of the system architecture in an industrial environment.","2020-06-10","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","15-20","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE Conference on Industrial Cyberphysical Systems (ICPS)","","","","Semantics; Ontologies; PaaS; Process planning; Production; alternative process chains; Companies; Manufacturing; Production as a service; system architecture; Systems architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE Conference on Industrial Cyberphysical Systems (ICPS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Task definitions such as explicit robot programs are hardly reusable from an application point-of-view. To improve the situation, a knowledge-based approach exploiting distributed declarative information and cloud computing offers many possibilities for knowledge exchange and reuse, and it has the potential to facilitate new business models for industrial solutions. However, there are many unresolved questions yet, e.g., those related to reliability, consistency, or legal responsibility. To investigate some of these issues, different knowledge-based architectures have been prototyped and evaluated by confronting the solution candidates with key application demands. The conclusion is that distributed cloud-based approaches offer many possibilities, but there is still a need for further research and better infrastructure before this approach can become industrially attractive.","2015-04","2025-11-10 09:28:54","2025-11-10 09:28:54","","519-528","","2","12","","IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge based systems; Ontologies; Software; Computer architecture; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems; Cognitive robotics; online knowledge bases; reuse of knowledge; robot programming; web services for robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The task is made even more challenging as the number of vulnerabilities associated with the cloud infrastructure and applications are increasing very rapidly. Understanding the security service level agreements (SSLAs) and privacy policies offered by service and infrastructure providers is critical for consumers to assess the risks of the Cloud before they consider migrating their IT operations to the Cloud. To address these concerns relative to the assessment of security and privacy risks of the Cloud, we have developed ontologies for representing security SLAs (SSLA) in this paper. Our ontologies for SSLAs can be used to understand the security agreements of a provider, to negotiate desired security levels, and to audit the compliance of a provider with respect to federal regulations (such as HIPAA).","2015-01-08","2025-11-10 09:28:55","2025-11-10 09:35:40","","166-172","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on High Assurance Systems Engineering","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 16; Conference name: 16th IEEE International Symposium on High Assurance Systems Engineering, HASE 2015; Conference location: Daytona Beach; FL</p>","","","Cloud computing; cloud computing; Risk assessment; Monitoring; Security; Ontologies; Quality of service; Cloud infrastructures; Network architecture; Privacy; Service Level Agreements; Facebook; Security and privacy; Systems engineering; security; SLA; Mobile security; Federal regulations; Infrastructure providers; service level agreement; SSLA; Business","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on High Assurance Systems Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach considers a cloud computing case study through the collection and analysis of a set of recent publications. To assess our proposal, we conducted a quantitative comparison between different clustering-intrinsic metrics. Results showed higher popularity and coverage of the present proposal than the state-of-the-art, especially when using hierarchical clustering.

In this work, we describe the RoboEarth semantic mapping system. The semantic map is composed of: 1) an ontology to code the concepts and relations in maps and objects and 2) a SLAM map providing the scene geometry and the object locations with respect to the robot. We propose to ground the terminological knowledge in the robot perceptions by means of the SLAM map of objects. RoboEarth boosts mapping by providing: 1) a subdatabase of object models relevant for the task at hand, obtained by semantic reasoning, which improves recognition by reducing computation and the false positive rate; 2) the sharing of semantic maps between robots; and 3) software as a service to externalize in the cloud the more intensive mapping computations, while meeting the mandatory hard real time constraints of the robot. To demonstrate the RoboEarth cloud mapping system, we investigate two action recipes that embody semantic map building in a simple mobile robot. The first recipe enables semantic map building for a novel environment while exploiting available prior information about the environment. The second recipe searches for a novel object, with the efficiency boosted thanks to the reasoning on a semantically annotated map. Our experimental results demonstrate that, by using RoboEarth cloud services, a simple robot can reliably and efficiently build the semantic maps needed to perform its quotidian tasks. In addition, we show the synergetic relation of the SLAM map of objects that grounds the terminological knowledge coded in the ontology.","2015-04","2025-11-10 09:28:55","2025-11-10 09:28:55","","432-443","","2","12","","IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantics; Knowledge based systems; Visualization; knowledge representation; semantic mapping; Navigation; Cloud mapping; object recognition; Search problems; Simultaneous localization and mapping; visual SLAM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Health data sharing is dependent on obtaining individual consent which, in turn, is hindered by a lack of resources. To this extent, blockchain-based platforms facilitate data sharing by creating a trusted distributed network of users. These users are enabled to share their data without depending on the time and resources of specific actors (such as the health services). In blockchain-based platforms, data governance mechanisms become very important due to the need to specify and monitor data sharing and data use conditions. In this article, we present a blockchain-based data-sharing consent model for access control over individual health data. We use smart contracts to dynamically represent the individual’s consent over health data and to enable data requesters to search and access those data. The dynamic consent model extends to two ontologies: the Data Use Ontology (DUO) which models the individual consent of users and the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M), which describes queries from data requesters. We deploy the model on Ethereum blockchain and evaluate different data sharing scenarios. The contribution of this article consists of the creation of an individual consent model for health data sharing platforms. Such a model guarantees that individual consent is respected and that all the participants in the data sharing platform are accountable. The evaluation of our solution indicates that such a data sharing model provides a flexible decision-making approach over data usage by data requesters. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model is efficient and adapts to personalized access control policies in different data-sharing scenarios.","2020","2025-11-10 09:28:55","2025-11-10 09:28:55","","143734-143745","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","data sharing; Blockchain; Ontologies; distributed ledgers; Peer-to-peer computing; Distributed databases; Data models; EHR exchange; individual consent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims at development of an ontology-driven cloud platform that would support deployment of various human-based applications and therefore reuse the existing crowd. Three features that distinguish the proposed platform from similar developments are ontologies, digital contracts and resource monitoring facilities. Ontological mechanisms (ability to precisely define semantics and use inference to find related terms) are used to find and allocate human resources required by software services. Digital contracts are used to achieve predictability required by cloud users (application developers). Finally, explicit mechanisms for resource monitoring are essential, as human resources are always limited and the developers of applications deployed in the platform should be aware of particular limitations.","2017-11-06","2025-11-10 09:29:04","2025-11-10 09:29:04","","304-310","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 21st Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT)","","","","Semantics; Monitoring; Ontologies; Software; Contracts; Information processing; Hafnium compounds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 21st Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, relinquishing control of sensitive medical data by delegating their storage and processing to third-party cloud providers naturally raises significant security concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise appropriate policies that infuse adequate access controls in cloud services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of these services, coupled with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinder the formulation of effective and interoperable policies that are appropriate for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work adopts the ontological templates proposed in [5] for the representation of access control policies in the medical sector. By capturing the knowledge that must be infused into an access control policy, these templates sufficiently address the needs of the underlying domain of application in which such a policy is to be enforced; at the same time, they facilitate developers in infusing adequate access controls to their cloud applications.","2017-06-22","2025-11-10 09:29:04","2025-11-10 09:35:41","","805-810","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 2; Conference name: 30th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems, CBMS 2017; Conference location: Thessaloniki; Conference sponsors: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Research Committee; ePBLnet: Establishment of the Supra-Regional Network of the National Centres in Medical Education, Focused on PBL and Virtual Patients; et al.; LLM Care: LLM Care Health and Social Care Ecosystem; SmokeFreeBrain: Multidisciplinary Tools for Improving the Efficacy of Public Prevention Measures against Smoking; The University of Nottingham</p>","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Cloud environments; Ontology; Medical computing; Interoperability; Digital storage; Cloud providers; Ontologies; Access control; Electronic document exchange; Electronic medical record; Cloud applications; Electronic medical records; Access control policies; Context-aware access control; Health care providers; Processing electronics; Security-by-design; Medical services; Context modeling; Process control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily. The application of Asclepios is wide ranging - from military to Government through to medical and tourism and pharmaceuticals. Further, Asclepios-like applications are very much needed in most Third world countries, including all countries in Africa, as it can significantly enhance the health, safety and well-being of people.","2017-06-30","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:35:45","","1-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 IST-Africa Week Conference (IST-Africa)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: V.L.

Proving an SLA violation is considered to be a complex operation to the cloud consumer. This task gets more and more difficult to the consumers as they use services from multiple providers, each with its own monitoring policies. In order to implicitly help the consumer monitor the SLA and detect violations, it is necessary to implement some advanced SLA management strategies. Ontological representation and reasoning techniques in SLA management may be beneficial to the evaluation of the QoS. In this regard, we propose a monitoring approach with a new semantic SLA modeling for cloud computing. Our approach aims to help cloud consumers monitor the SLA documents and detect violations by considering the semantic meaning of SLA concepts and taking profit from the power of reasoning techniques. This maintains a reliable QoS and respects the SLA parameters.

To manage service performance, consumers have to validate rules embedded in cloud legal contracts, such as Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Privacy Policies, that are available as text documents. Currently this analysis requires significant time and manual labor and is thus inefficient. We propose a cognitive assistant that can be used to manage cloud legal documents by automatically extracting knowledge (terms, rules, constraints) from them and reasoning over it to validate service performance. In this paper, we present this Question and Answering (Q&A) system that can be used to analyze and obtain information from the SLA documents.

Controlling and limiting access to such documents requires a robust and trustworthy access control mechanism. In this paper, we propose a semantically rich access control system that employs an access broker module to evaluate access decisions based on rules generated using the organizations confidentiality policies. The proposed system analyzes the multi-valued attributes of the user making the request and the requested document that is stored on a cloud service platform, before making an access decision. Furthermore, our system guarantees an end-to-end oblivious data transaction between the organization and the cloud service provider using oblivious storage techniques. Thus, an organization can use our system to secure their documents as well as obscure their access pattern details from an untrusted cloud service provider.","2017-06-25","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:35:17","","142-149","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 16; Conference name: 1st IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing, EDGE 2017; Conference location: Honolulu; HI</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Ontology; Distributed database systems; Cloud service providers; Digital storage; Ontologies; Encryption; Access control; OWL; Access Broker; Access Control; Secure cloud storages; Access control mechanism; Access decision; Confidentiality Policy; Data transaction; Multi-valued attribute; Oblivious Storage; Storage technique; Computational modeling; Organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have identified SNSs categorically as presenting a number of unique usability challenges for users with visual impairments, a contentions supported by our ethnographic study of Facebook involving blind participants and the JAWS screen reader. Participants were most severely challenged by the process of creating and modifying user profile information and identifying other users with whom to establish relationships. The ability to decouple these activities from any single SNS using a FOAFbased cloud system may enable users to perform these activities in a more screen reader compatible (e.g. JAWS, NVDA) environment. In this paper we propose a portable profile cloud architecture based on the FOAF vocabulary and discuss the implementation of this architecture using several services of the Windows Azure cloud ecosystem. This system, as implemented, enables users to create multiple, parallel SNS-agnostic user profiles. As the system is currently constituted, these profiles can be generated with new data or information retrieved from an existing Facebook user profile. This modifiable profile and relationship information is then exported to Azure BLOB storage as an RDF file that may be accessed via a URL and may be used with any compatible system.","2017-06-25","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:29:05","","104-111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC)","","","","Semantic Web; Facebook; Resource description framework; Usability; Uniform resource locators; Vocabulary; Accessibility; Azure; Blind; Social Networking Sites; Social Web; User Profile Portability; Web of Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the possible solutions is the use of data anonymization techniques, which performs an important role in data privacy protection. There are several techniques and algorithms to implement data anonymization. However, specifications and guidelines to guide and standardize the use of these resources are needed. These guidelines, called anonymization policies, are considered an important asset in organizations that want to protect their customer personal data. Although the use of data anonymization brings great benefits, there are no clear directions for data anonymization policies, which ends up limiting its adoption by companies and organizations. This work presents a generic anonymization policy to be used in cloud and big data platforms. It also presents a draft ontology with explicit formal specifications for data anonymization policies. This ontology has three main intentions: (i) to standardize the use of data anonymization policies; (ii) share common understanding of the structure of data anonymization among people; (iii) enable reuse of data anonymization policies. In this work, an ongoing study case within the EUBra-BIGSEA project will be implemented.","2017-06-26","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:34:53","","75-82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 47th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN-W)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 10; Conference name: 47th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops, DSN-W 2017; Conference location: Denver; CO; Conference sponsors: IEEE Computer Society; ifip; University of Colorado Boulder (CU)</p>","","","Cloud computing; Ontology; ontology; Advanced technology; Ontology-based; Ontologies; Big data; Data privacy; Big Data; Specifications; Data platform; Anonymization; data anonymization; Data anonymization; data anonymization policies; Data privacy protections; Data solutions; Formal specification; Study case; Organizations; Standards organizations; Guidelines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 47th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN-W)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is confusion in scientific discourse regarding the systemization of big data technologies which exacerbates this problem. Therefore, in this paper, a structured literature review is conducted to assess the current state of the art and give an overview about big data technology classifications. It can be stated that only very limited approaches for classifications exist, which are partially incomplete or address only single aspects of big data technologies, such as the used database type. Conducting this literature review, investigations have also been made to derive possible starting points for extending existing or developing new classification approaches, which can form the basis of a future big data classification framework. Such a concept could be used to improve the decision-support for planning and managing big data projects. However, a common understanding would require unambiguous definitions of the term technology and various other expressions, which are used in the literature as a synonym today.","2017-07-24","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:29:05","","388-397","","","01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 IEEE 19th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI)","","","","Ontologies; Computer architecture; Taxonomy; Big Data; Classification; Databases; Organizations; Bibliographies; Big Data Technologie; Decision Support; Literature Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE 19th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To ensure data confidentiality and fine-grained access control in cloud-based environments, stored data and resources needs to be re-encrypted periodically or based on special mechanisms such as revoked user-based or manual re-encryption. Managing the process of re-encryption is a challenging issue that involves many limitations such as time management, resource confidentiality, and level of access. Accordingly, a multi-level re-encryption model based on policy management has been presented in this paper to ensure data security in clouds. The proposed model uses a policy-based ontology to generate, manage and apply re-encryption policies based on the characteristics of resources, sensitivity of data and capabilities of service provider. The results of comprehensive performance and security analysis of proposed model shows this model increases the reliability of re-encryption processes in cloud storages considerably and provides an efficient policy management for re-encryption tasks.","2017-07-06","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:35:36","","15-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE EUROCON 2017 -17th International Conference on Smart Technologies","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 17th IEEE International Conference on Smart Technologies, EUROCON 2017; Conference location: Ohrid; Metropol Lake Resort; Conference sponsors: Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering; Faculty of Electrical Engineering and IT; Neotel; Netcetera; Saints Cyril and Methodius University</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud computing; Security; Information management; Ontologies; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Resource management; Reliability; Cryptography; Encryption; Access control; Security and privacy; On-demand services; Emerging technologies; Public policy; Comprehensive performance; Computer privacy; Data confidentiality; Policy; Re-encryption; Re-Encryption; Reliability analysis; Resource Management; Data models; Computational modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE EUROCON 2017 -17th International Conference on Smart Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These documents are generated following a process of negotiation during which the client chooses a subset of clauses among choices predefined by the provider on a ""take it or leave it"" basis. However, the heterogeneity between client requests and provider offers may result in inappropriate SLA. In addition, the cloud service context may change over the time which causes a client requirements adjustment and therefore, the SLA remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cloud SLA negotiation and re-negotiation approach that integrate a semantic mapping between client requests and provider offers with the aim of generating a suitable SLA document. Moreover, our approach includes a context-aware system to adapt the SLA throughout reasoning techniques and automatically ensure the re-negotiation.

The paper presents a solution to prevent high risk situations, using ontology as support in profiling pregnant women with possible pregnancy risks. Based on ontology and available medical database of one of the largest maternity hospitals in Timisoara (Bega) we create profiles of women focusing on cases with problems and high potential risks, using as tool the open source Protégé for ontology and Visual Studio .Net for the supporting application. The ontology creates links between the characteristics of pregnant women, medical history, disease and possible problems that may occur during pregnancy. The ontology is used in an application stored in cloud to be accessed by physicians from different locations.

However, currently, the CABAN paradigm in the healthcare domain is facing increasing difficulty in handling the huge amount of sensor data that the body sensor devices generate from diverse Smart home applications. Therefore, the challenging is now timely storing, processing, and analyzing of the sensor data in real time to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the caregivers or Smart home applications. QoS, here, is the capacity to support diverse Smart home applications in healthcare with different priorities, performance, and resource requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast and robust cloud resource allocation model for body sensor devices to ensure QoS for Smart home healthcare applications. We develop the proposed resource allocation algorithm using agent-based modeling (ABM) and ontology. There are few works, which consider ABM and ontology for resource allocation in CABAN platform. Moreover, we used an ABM tool called NetLogo to implement the proposed resource allocation model.

While one cloud provider is good at one or a few services, other providers might be good at other services. Cloud users eventually want to consume most advantageous resources across multiple providers with the best price while avoiding vendor lock-in. Cloud users also need to safeguard their most valuable digital asset, their data, against cloud outage, which can happen to any vendor. This could mean using the same type of resources across multiple cloud providers. Moreover, cloud providers are continuously changing and evolving their services. Cloud users can only take advantage of these changes if they are able to relocate and real-locate resources using an autonomous and vendor independent tool. We propose a vendor-independent cloud provisioning tool that utilizes an ontology-based semantic reasoning to acquire the best feasible cloud resources for cloud users. In this paper, we outline an ontology subset for purchasing cloud resources or services based on price, user transaction volume, preference, quality of service and Service Layer Agreements (SLA). The proposed ontology is outlined in a case scenario followed by an applied algorithm for negotiating resource purchase between cloud consumer client and cloud vendor provisioning services. Such ontology can be used in inter-cloud federation API for monitoring and acquiring and maintaining the most advantageous cloud resources.","2017-04-28","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:35:30","","466-472","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis (ICCCBDA)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 7; Conference name: 2nd IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis, ICCCBDA 2017; Conference location: Chengdu</p>","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontology; Monitoring; Ontology-based; Cloud consumers; Cloud providers; Quality of service; Big data; Data handling; Information analysis; Semantic reasoning; Electronic trading; cloud resource brokerage; Cloud service managements; monitoring cloud provider performance; Multi-vendor; multi-vendor cloud resource provisioning ontology; semantic reasoning for resource provisioning; Software deployment; User transaction; Pricing; Tools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis (ICCCBDA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is achieved by leveraging IT virtualization techniques and combining them with programmable networks. By doing so, NFV and SDN are able to decouple the network functionality from the physical devices on which they are deployed. Service function chains (SFCs) composed out of virtual network functions (VNFs) can now be deployed on top of the virtualized infrastructure to create new value-added services. Current NFV approaches are limited to mapping the different VNF to the physical substrate subject to resource capacity constraints. They do not provide the possibility to define location requirements with a certain granularity and constraints on the colocation of VNF and virtual edges. Nevertheless, many scenarios can be envisioned in which a service provider (SP) would like to attach placement constraints for efficiency, resilience, legislative, privacy, and economic reasons. Therefore, we propose a set of affinity and anti-affinity constraints, which can be used by SP to define such placement restrictions. Furthermore, a semantic SFC validation framework is proposed that allows the virtual network function infrastructure provider (VNFInP) to check the validity of a set of constraints and provide feedback to the SPs. This allows the VNFInP to filter out any non-valid SFC requests before sending them to the mapping algorithm, significantly reducing the mapping time.","2017-06","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:29:05","","317-331","","2","14","","IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Network function virtualization; Resource management; Privacy; Virtualization; Hardware; Resilience; semantic technology; software defined networking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this highly dynamic scenario, both providers and consumers need to formalize their contractual and legal relationship, creating service level agreements. Although there exist some proposals that provide models to describe that relationship, they usually only cover technical aspects, not providing explicit semantics to the agreement terms. Furthermore, these models cannot be effectively shared on the Web, since they do not actually follow Web principles. These drawbacks hamper take-up and automatic analysis. In this article, we introduce Linked USDL Agreement, a semantic model to specify, manage and share service level agreement descriptions on the Web. This model is part of the Linked USDL family of ontologies that can describe not only technical but also business related aspects of services, incorporating Web principles. We validate our proposal by describing agreements in computational and non-computational scenarios, namely cloud computing and business process outsourcing services. Moreover, we evaluate the actual coverage and expressiveness of Linked USDL Agreement comparing it with existing models. In order to foster its adoption and effectively manage the service level agreement lifecycle, we present an implemented tool that supports creation, automatic analysis, and publication on the Web of agreement descriptions.","2017-02-01","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:35:44","","52-65","","1","10","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 27</p>","","","Semantics; Commerce; Ontologies; Quality of service; Biological system modeling; Network architecture; Service level agreements; service management; Service management; Semantic analysis; Outsourcing; Service Level Agreements; Quality control; semantic analysis; Semantic Model; Business service; business services; Management science; quality of services; semantic modeling; service trading; Service trading; Proposals; Computational modeling; Vocabulary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, Cloud computing breaks the organization perimeters. When data resides in the Cloud, they reside outside the organizational bounds. This leads users to a loos of control over their data and raises reasonable security concerns that slow down the adoption of Cloud computing. Is the Cloud service provider accessing the data? Is it legitimately applying the access control policy defined by the user? This paper presents a data-centric access control solution with enriched role-based expressiveness in which security is focused on protecting user data regardless the Cloud service provider that holds it. Novel identity-based and proxy re-encryption techniques are used to protect the authorization model. Data is encrypted and authorization rules are cryptographically protected to preserve user data against the service provider access or misbehavior. The authorization model provides high expressiveness with role hierarchy and resource hierarchy support. The solution takes advantage of the logic formalism provided by Semantic Web technologies, which enables advanced rule management like semantic conflict detection.

Consequently, a reference process model is generally evolved to a couple of process variants, known as a process family. Currently, there exist some approaches and tools that can efficiently configure a reference process model. However, a key issue is how to manage co-evolution appropriately within a family of process models if the base process model of a process family is changed. Contemporary process management tools do not adequately support the management of such co-evolution. Each process variant in the process family has to be changed as a separate process model which often leads to redundancies and inefficiencies. In this article, we propose a novel approach for managing co-evolution of process families based on an aspect-oriented approach. Change options on base process model are abstracted and extracted as a pluggable component, which can be selectively reused for all members, and consequently, guides the co-evolution for the whole process family. In particular, the control-flow and data-flow relations between process extension and a member of process families can be built by leveraging process extensibility patterns. The correctness of our extension approach is proved based on graph theory. The whole approach in this article have been implemented as a working open-source prototype and tested against a real case study from the city logistic distribution domain as well as real data set from SAP reference models.","2017-12-01","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:29:05","","854-867","","6","10","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Open source software; Semantics; semantic annotation; Logistics; Pattern matching; Prototypes; and evolution; aspect-oriented programming; BPM prototype; business process model; Object oriented programming; pattern; Process family; process graph; Process management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a framework for verifying secure composability of distributed workflows in an autonomous multi-domain environment. The objective of workflow composability verification is to ensure that all the users or processes executing the designated workflow tasks conform to the time-dependent security policy specifications of all collaborating domains. A key aspect of such verification is to determine the time-dependent schedulability of distributed workflows, assumed to be invoked on a recurrent basis. We use a two-step approach for verifying secure workflow composability. In the first step, a distributed workflow is decomposed into domain-specific projected workflows and is verified for conformance with the respective domain's security and access control policy. In the second step, the cross-domain dependencies amongst the workflow tasks performed by different collaborating domains are verified.","2017-10-01","2025-11-10 09:29:05","2025-11-10 09:36:13","","478-493","","5","14","","IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 12</p>","","","Cloud computing; Cloud computing environments; Semantic Web technology; Security and privacy protection; Access control; verification; Cloud computing infrastructures; Indexes; Authorization; Access control policies; Verification; Work simplification; access controls; Large-scale business; workflow management; Workflow managements; Workflow-based applications; Computers; Business; Unified modeling language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A service selection algorithm was proposed in order to select the closest classification for the user's requester. A trust evaluation mechanism was introduced, combined with direct trust and domain recommended trust. Then a service resource was selected among the requester's classification, which is trusted. When the transaction was completed, the service satisfaction was evaluated and the trust degree was updated. Simulation results show that the model can improve the service requesters' satisfaction and has certain resilience to intentional noncooperation.","2016-12-23","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","487-491","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing (PIC)","","","","Cloud computing; cloud computing; Ontologies; Heuristic algorithms; SLA; Computational modeling; Analytical models; Information processing; cloud service selection; dynamic trust; Registers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing (PIC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple issues and challenges in discovering cloud services appear due to the lack of the cloud service description standardization. In fact, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services while proposing ontologies. However, since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology (CSO), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. This paper contribution is threefold. First, it specifies a set of patterns and anti-patterns in order to evaluate CSO. Second, it defines an anti-pattern detection method based on SPARQL queries which provides a set of correction recommendations to help ontologists revise the ontology. Finally, some experiment tests were conducted in relation to: (i) the method efficiency and (ii) anti-pattern detection of design anomalies as well as taxonomic and domain errors within CSO.","2016-12-29","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:36:26","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE/ACS 13th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 3; Conference name: 13th IEEE/ACS International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications, AICCSA 2016; Conference location: Agadir</p>","","","Cloud computing; Ontology; Evaluation approach; Distributed database systems; Ontologies; Standardization; Cloud computing services; Reusability; Ontology evaluations; On-demand computing; Emerging technologies; Standards; Software as a service; Pattern recognition; Understandability; Hardware and software; Experiment tests; Redundancy; Electronic mail; Virtual machining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE/ACS 13th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, they need to be converted to semantic rules that can be understood by the search engine of the manufacturing ontologies. Our previous work investigated converting service rules to semantic rules automatically. However, the scheme is not flexible enough.

The aim of this paper is to propose a framework using an ontology to capture relevant information from different data sources. In order to achieve this aim, we review past literature related to the model based ontology that incorporate both internal data and external data sources.

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. It is a simple key-based object store where each Amazon S3 object has data, a key, and metadata. Object key name identifies the object in a bucket uniquely. Object metadata is a set of name-value pairs that can be set at the time of uploading. This design enables S3 to provide excellent performance for storing and retrieving objects based on a known key. However there are certain challenges which limits the use of the Object metadata efficiently due to non-standard metadata keys. On the other hand, ontology has been used to represent information in various domains. The use of ontology to model the information coming from heterogeneous sources results in non-ambiguous and a standard representation. Additionally, with an ontology based metadata the underlying metadata keys have the same shared semantic meaning. Thus ontology representation of S3 objects makes searching of objects using required attributes faster and efficient. This paper presents an ontology so that the metadata for all S3 objects have a common standard and same shared semantic meaning.","2016-12-19","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","507-512","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 International Conference on Computing, Analytics and Security Trends (CAST)","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontology; Ontologies; Metadata; Search; Semantic; Standards; Vocabulary; Amazon S3; Objects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 International Conference on Computing, Analytics and Security Trends (CAST)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, an On-demand Service mode is put forwards to simplify and improve the matching process between manufacturing services and customers' requirements. The manufacturing task ontology and the corresponding cloud service ontology are designed.

Cloud vendors that give substantial support to other third party developers to integrate hosted services into new software solutions would have a unique selling feature over their competitors. However, to reliably determine if a service is reusable, comprehensive service specifications are needed. Characteristic for comprehensive in contrast to syntactical specifications are the formalization of ontological and behavioral semantics, homogeneity according to a global ontology, and a service grounding that links the abstract service description and its technical realization. Homogeneous, semantical specifications enable to reliably identify reusable services, whereas the service grounding is needed for the technical service integration. In general, comprehensive specifications are not available and have to be derived. Existing automatized approaches are restricted to certain characteristics of comprehensiveness. In my PhD, I consider an automatized approach to derive fully-fledged comprehensive specifications for black-box services. Ontological semantics are derived from syntactical interface specifications. Behavioral semantics are mined from call logs that cloud vendors create to monitor the hosted services. The specifications are harmonized over a global ontology. The service grounding is established using traceability information. The approach enables third party developers to compose services into complex systems and creates new sales channels for cloud and service providers.","2016-05-14","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","815-818","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE/ACM 38th International Conference on Software Engineering Companion (ICSE-C)","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Ontologies; Reliability; Grounding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE/ACM 38th International Conference on Software Engineering Companion (ICSE-C)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the many benefits offered by cloud storage, many potential users with sensitive data refrain from fully utilizing this service due to valid concerns about information privacy. An established solution to this concern is to perform encryption on the user side with the key stored on a local machine, meaning the cloud will never see the user's plaintext data. However, by encrypting data on the user side data processing capabilities (e.g., searching) are lost. In particular, the ability to semantically search is of the user's interest in large datasets. In this paper, we present S3C, a system that provides a semantic search functionality over encrypted data in the cloud. S3C combines approaches from traditional keyword-based searchable encryption and semantic web searching. It offers a user transparent experience that accepts a simple multi-phrase query and returns a list of documents ranked by semantic relevance to the query. Our proposed approach is space-efficient, which makes it suitable for large scale datasets. Our minimal processing also allows the system to be run on thin clients such as smart-phones or tablets. We evaluate the performance of our system against various real-world datasets, and our results show that it produces accurate search results while maintaining minimal storage overhead (~0.3% of the dataset size).","2016-12-05","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","3722-3731","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Cloud services; Encryption; Searchable Encryption; Indexes; Servers; Semantic Search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, due to security concerns, enterprises are reluctant to migrate their operations to the cloud. In addition, the proliferation of cloud services transforms the enterprise IT environment into a complex ecosystem of collaborating services. One way to tame this complexity and alleviate the security concerns is to rely on policies that regulate the deployment, delivery and governance of cloud services. However, the heterogeneity inherent in such services, coupled with the dynamic nature of cloud environments, hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable policies. This paper proposes a generic framework for the definition and representation of policies that are enforceable across diverse administrative domains and are amenable to automated correctness checks.","2016-12-12","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:35:07","","277-284","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 14; Conference name: 8th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, CloudCom 2016; Conference location: Luxembourg; Parc Alvisse Hotel; Conference sponsors: Cloud Computing Association; IEEE Cloud Computing; IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC); Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR); University of Luxembourg</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud platforms; Cloud-computing; Cloud computing; Cloud security; Semantics; Cloud environments; Cloud services; Cost saving; Security; Ontologies; Ecosystems; Access control; Ontological frameworks; Linked USDL; Policy; Complex ecosystems; Enterprise IS; Enterprise IT; Concrete","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has recently gained a great attention because of cloud pay-as-you-go model which drastically reduces actual IT infrastructure with high performance and continuous availability. In order to effectively utilize existing cloud resources, organizations may look for available cloud resources from different cloud providers. However, cloud resources are heterogeneous and described by different standards which prevents an easy and dynamic interoperability between organizations. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework tackling this heterogeneity issue. We develop a set of ontologies to semantically represent cloud resources by looking at three cloud resource description standards: Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA), Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), and Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI). Hence, our framework promotes the creation of a common semantic knowledge base of cloud resources described using these different standards. This knowledge base allows a seamless translation of cloud providers' resource descriptions. We developed an application to validate our approach as a proof of concept. We also evaluated the feasibility and completeness of our semantic framework on use cases obtained from standard specifications.","2016-07-27","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","585-592","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; ontology; Interoperability; Ontologies; Organizations; Standards organizations; cloud resource description standard; semantic web technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the existing Resource Description Framework (RDF) database engines are not scalable and are less reliable in heterogeneous clouds. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Acacia-RDF which is a scalable distributed RDF graph database engine developed with X10 programming language to solve this issue. Acacia-RDF partitions the RDF data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable SPARQL (an RDF query language) processor for Acacia-RDF which operates on top of partitioned RDF data. Furthermore, we designed and implemented a replication based fault tolerance mechanism for Acacia-RDF. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of LUBM (Lehigh University Benchmark) RDF benchmark data sets. We make a comparison of Acacia-RDF's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-RDF scales well with LUBM data sets. Acacia-RDF reported less than ten seconds elapsed times on 16 places for running the first and the third queries of the LUBM benchmark on LUBM 160 universities data set with 3.6 million vertices and 28.5 million edges which was 1.7GB in size.

Meanwhile, microservice architectures are becoming increasingly popular in cloud computing as they promote decomposing applications into small services that can be independently deployed and scaled, thus optimizing resources usage. However, setting up a multi-cloud environment to deploy a microservices-based application is still a very complex and time consuming task. Each microservice may require different functionality (e.g. software platforms, databases, monitoring and scalability tools) and have different location and redundancy requirements. Selection of cloud providers should take into account the individual requirements of each service, as well as the global requirements of reliability and scalability. Moreover, cloud providers can be very heterogeneous and offer disparate functionality, thus hindering comparison. In this paper we propose an automated approach for the selection and configuration of cloud providers for multi-cloud microservices-based applications. Our approach uses a domain specific language to describe the application's multi-cloud requirements and we provide a systematic method for obtaining proper configurations that comply with the application's requirements and the cloud providers' constraints.","2016-07-27","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","327-334","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","","","","Cloud computing; Ontologies; multi-cloud; Buildings; Databases; Scalability; cloud management; Gears; microservices; software product lines; variability management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud SLAs are policy documents describing the legal agreement between cloud providers and customers. SLA specifies the commitment of availability, performance of services, penalties associated with violations and procedure for customers to receive compensations in case of service disruptions. The aim of our research is to develop technology solutions for automated cloud service management using Semantic Web and Text Mining techniques. In this paper we discuss in detail the challenges in automating cloud services management and present our preliminary work in extraction of knowledge from SLAs of different cloud services. We extracted two types of information from the SLA documents which can be useful for end users. First, the relationship between the service commitment and financial credit. We represented this information by enhancing the existing Cloud service ontology proposed by us in our previous research. Second, we extracted rules in the form of obligations and permissions from SLAs using modal and deontic logic formalizations.

Despite this, the service model is still plagued with several adoption inhibitors, one of which is lack of interoperability between proprietary application infrastructure services of public PaaS solutions. Although there is some progress in addressing the general PaaS interoperability issue through various devised solutions focused primarily on API compatibility, platform-agnostic application design models, interoperability specific to differentiated services provided by the existing public PaaS providers, the resultant disparity owing to the offered services' semantics has not been addressed effectively, yet. The literature indicates that this dimension of PaaS interoperability is awaiting evolution in the state-of-the-art. This paper proposes the initial system design of a PaaS interoperability (IntPaaS) framework to be developed through the integration of semantic, agent technologies to enable transparent interoperability between incompatible PaaS services. This will involve uniform description through semantic annotation of PaaS provider services utilizing the OWL-S ontology, creating a knowledgebase that enables software agents to automatically search for suitable services to support Cloud-based Greenfield application development.

Specifying who can view data shared in online social network becomes a serious concern for average users. One of the main causes of the problem is due to the limited expressivity of the provided access control mechanisms that do not enable users to define the temporal context under which their shared data should be accessed. To address these limitations, we suggest using temporal non-monotonic description logic based system TL-JClassic+δε as formalism for representing, reasoning about dynamic temporal context based access control policies. The main features of our model is that, it allows to associate temporal constraints with each data shared in social network as well as enable data owner's to make some exception for certain rules by allowing some users to get the right to access some data while they would not be allowed to access by default,, therefore the access control decision will be dynamic, depending on the context when the request is made.","2016-07-18","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","730-736","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 Intl IEEE Conferences on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced and Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing and Communications, Cloud and Big Data Computing, Internet of People, and Smart World Congress (UIC/ATC/ScalCom/CBDCom/IoP/SmartWorld)","","","","Semantics; data privacy; Ontologies; Access control; Context; dynamic access control; Context modeling; Cognition; Social network services; nonmonotonic description logic; online social networks; temporal context","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 Intl IEEE Conferences on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced and Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing and Communications, Cloud and Big Data Computing, Internet of People, and Smart World Congress (UIC/ATC/ScalCom/CBDCom/IoP/SmartWorld)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extracting such knowledge from Natural Language text is an essential work and a very remarkable research topic in the Semantic Web field. The logic programming language Prolog, based on the definite-clause formalism, is a useful tool for implementing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. However, web-based services for NLP have also been developed recently, and they represent an important alternative to be considered. In this paper we present the comparison between two different approaches in NLP, for the automatic creation of an OWL ontology supporting the semantic annotation of text. The first one is a pure Prolog approach, based on grammar and logic analysis rules. The second one is based on Watson Relationship Extraction service of IBM Cloud platform Bluemix. We evaluate the two approaches in terms of performance, the quality of NLP result, OWL completeness and richness.","2016-07-06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","537-542","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 10th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS)","","","","Semantics; Ontology; Natural Language Processing; Natural language processing; Ontologies; OWL; Indexes; Grammar; IBM Watson; Prolog","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 10th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, such solutions consist mostly on ICT developments, which permit the collection, distribution, integration, analysis, and manipulation of heterogeneous data. The under way Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project targets the development of cloud-enabled tools for supporting the SMEs supply network optimization of manufacturing and logistic assets. The C2NET solution includes the implementation of paradigms as e.g. cloud computing or service-oriented and event-driven architectures, used for wide data integration. Among its requirements, the C2NET platform needs a solution for catch, process and react to events triggered in different locations of collaborative manufacturing networks, which are endowed with devices that permits the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This paper presents the architecture and main functionality of a knowledge-based approach that allows processing supply chain events handled by CPS devices. The main component of the presented solution is the SECA ontology, which is a knowledge base that can be updated at runtime. The main purpose of the ontology is to describe events, their status and the actions to be performed once a set of events are triggered in certain order. This research work offers a solution that can be employed by the C2NET platform not only to catch and process events; but also to notify linked data consumers.","2016-10-23","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:36:36","","4877-4883","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 5; Conference name: 42nd Conference of the Industrial Electronics Society, IECON 2016; Conference location: Florence; Palazzo dei Congressi; Conference sponsors: IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES); Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); CODEN: IEPRE</p>","","","Cloud computing; Ontology; ontology; Knowledge based systems; Optimization; Ontologies; Supply chains; SPARQL; Engines; cyber-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Event processing; Knowledge-based system; Manufacturing; event processing; knowledge-based system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a database partitioning approach to logically and physically separate data and distribute the partitions across several different cloud providers is applied. This data distribution is called fixed vertical partitioning and distribution approach (FVPD), as data schemes are vertically partitioned and distributed across various different cloud providers. Hence, this framework uses a security-by-distribution approach to storing sensitive data securely and privacy-ware in all possible cloud deployment models and thus, it provides a solution to improve the level of security and privacy. The proposed FVPD approach also becomes viable in the context of LOD and the Semantic Web. Furthermore, in relevant literature no approach in this context has been dealing with security and privacy so far. Therefore, this work transfers the FVPD approach from relational databases to Semantic Web Frameworks (Apache Jena, Sesame, etc.) that provide storage engines for RDF data and corresponding SPARQL endpoints. Above that, the query performance of such a federated environment is compared to a non-partitioned and non-distributed environment. For this, an adapted version of the TPC-W benchmark is used. Thus, this work shows how the query performance is affected when relational database data are exposed as SPARQL endpoints in RDF-based form and how the FVPD approach influences the query performance. Finally, it illustrates a mechanism to improve the level of security and privacy through a security-by-distribution approach.","2016-10-13","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:36:32","","241-247","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 2; Conference name: 1st IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet, ICCCI 2016; Conference location: Wuhan</p>","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Query processing; cloud computing; semantic web; Security; Digital storage; Relational database systems; Virtual storage; Data privacy; Relational Database; Context; Resource description framework; Security and privacy; Linked open data (LOD); Distributed environments; security; Database partitioning; RDF-based data; Vertical partitioning; Distributed databases; Relational databases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of VMs or containers represents an efficient way to automatize the overall software engineering and operation life-cycle. Some of the benefits include elasticity and high scalability, which increases the utilization efficiency and decreases the operational costs. VMs or containers as software artifacts are created using provider-specific templates and are stored in proprietary or public repositories for further use. However, technology specific choices may reduce their portability, lead to a vendor lock-in, particularly when applications need to run in federated Clouds. In this paper we present the current state of development of the novel concept of a VM repository and operational environment for federated Clouds named ENTICE. The ENTICE environment has been designed to receive unmodified and functionally complete VM images from its users, and transparently tailor and optimise them for specific Cloud infrastructures with respect to their size, configuration, and geographical distribution, such that they are loaded, delivered, and executed faster and with improved QoS compared to their current behaviour. Furthermore, in this work a specific use case scenario for the ENTICE environment has been provided and the underlying novel technologies have been presented.","2016-10-03","2025-11-10 09:29:06","2025-11-10 09:29:06","","242-247","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","","","","Conferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper utilizes a task-oriented approach to examine user requirements expressed as ontology to map requirements to cloud service characteristics to which prices are attached. The methodology described in this paper builds on previous work in semantic cloud service description and pricing of cloud services. The advantages of the approach are that there is a clear methodology for deriving prices for cloud services from multiple service characteristics based on semantic reasoning.

Manufacturing ontologies are used to store the service information. Manufacturers use service rules to control how their resources can be accessed. The rules are normally written in natural language. Thus, they need to be converted to semantic rules that can be understood by the search engine of the manufacturing ontologies. Manually converting service rules to semantic rules is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposed an approach that automatically converts service rules to semantic rules. The proposed scheme classifies the semantics of typical service rules into several semantic categories. Natural language processing techniques are used to process the service rules to map the semantic meanings of the rules to the relevant semantic categories. Then, the identified semantic categories are converted to semantic rules.

As the internet evolves toward Web 3.0, blockchain technology is emerging as a foundational infrastructure for decentralization, transparency, and distributed collaboration. Applications like the metaverse, which demand real-time responsiveness and high computational throughput, further underscore the need for scalable and resilient computing frameworks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for crowdsourcing computationally intensive tasks using blockchain and smart contracts. Operating atop existing blockchain networks, a Master (or Requester) node defines a computational problem, decomposes it into subtasks, and deploys a smart contract to manage task distribution. Worker nodes perform the computations off-chain using local resources and submit their results via on-chain transactions. The smart contract aggregates these results and finally, the Master validates them and automatically distributes rewards in cryptocurrency. A proof-of-concept simulation using Ganache, Solidity, and off-chain scripts demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, showcasing key features such as task decomposition, off-chain computation, and automated result handling. These findings underscore blockchain’s potential to enable transparent, automated, and scalable coordination of distributed computing tasks.","2025-08-27","2025-11-10 09:29:12","2025-11-10 09:29:12","","421-429","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2025 International Conference on Metaverse Computing, Networking and Applications (MetaCom)","","","","Semantic Web; Throughput; Web 3.0; Smart contract; Crowdsourcing; Smart contracts; Blockchains; Computational modeling; Real-time systems; Metaverse; Blockchain technology; Cryptocurrency; Distributed computing; Off-chain computation; On-chain transaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025 International Conference on Metaverse Computing, Networking and Applications (MetaCom)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud-based security ontologies are organized frameworks that delineate and classify topics pertinent to security in CC settings. They assist in standardizing language and enhance communication, interoperability, and comprehension among diverse stakeholders, including security experts, developers, and organizations. The ontology-based security strategy is one of the security solutions used by relevant parties. Nevertheless, target customers and cloud service providers see it as complex and lacking in security, since the applicable paradigms for various contexts are not clearly defined. Previous research has identified many security ideas that service providers might use, employing several evaluation methodologies. This highlights the growing need for reviewing the literature on Cloud Security Ontology (CSO). This research outlines the current state of the art in cloud computing ontology (CCO) and conducts a comprehensive literature review on the topic. Using the systematic literature review (SLR) approach, we identified 100 papers; 60 were selected based on established criteria, and 25 were assessed to be pertinent to the study. Scholars have shown active interest in four main areas of CC—service description, cloud security (CS), cloud resource management, cloud interoperability, and cloud service discovery—where cloud ontologies have had a significant impact. According to the research, fifteen of the thirty-one methods described in the literature for using ontologies in the cloud domain are still in use in legacy computing settings.

Second, a stable core group of authors has yet to emerge domestically, and collaborations between research institutions are mostly confined to specific regions with limited collaboration. Third, digital talent research mainly focuses on the digital economy and digitalization, enterprise digitalization and digital transformation, and the cultivation of digital talent.

However, the sparsity of service data and the presence of noise in interactions make it extremely challenging to accurately capture user preferences. Existing service recommendation methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily rely on ID aggregation, often neglecting the richness of textual semantics and are susceptible to interaction noise, resulting in suboptimal modeling of user-service relationships. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable advantages in capturing textual semantics, current methods struggle to effectively align structural representations with textual representations, limiting improvements in recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-semantic graph diffusion model for service recommendation, DiffMSR, which aims to align textual and structural representations while learning the generation process of interaction graphs in a denoising manner. This approach mitigates data sparsity and effectively reduces noise interference. Specifically, the model leverages LLMs to capture the textual semantic features of service descriptions and integrates them with structured semantic information from knowledge graphs. Through cross-semantic contrastive learning, it achieves heterogeneous semantic alignment. Furthermore, the model introduces a multisemantic diffusion-based generation framework, which iteratively denoises to construct high-quality user-service interaction graphs. This significantly enhances the multi-semantic awareness of user representations, thereby improving recommendation performance. Experiments on public service datasets demonstrate that DiffMSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving improvements of 4.13% and 6.37% in recommendation accuracy and recall, respectively.","2025-10","2025-11-10 09:29:12","2025-11-10 09:36:09","","2740-2753","","5","18","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: B.

This complexity poses significant challenges for the precise matching of manufacturing resources with manufacturing service demands on industrial Internet platform. To address these issues, this paper proposes an ontology modeling framework for the supply and demand matching of manufacturing services and resources, which achieving a unified semantic description of heterogeneous resources and manufacturing services on the industrial Internet platform with Domain-Specific Language (DSL). Employing reasoning engine to facilitate the rapid matching of manufacturing services with manufacturing resources.

However, most existing SBR methods still suffer from data sparsity issues due to short-term interactions. To alleviate the above issues, we propose a teacher and student distillation framework called TSKD for SBR. TSKD characterizes user intent by building multiple graphs. Specifically, a student graph (cross-session graph) and a teacher graph (item attribute similarity graph) are first constructed to supplement the session data. Then, graph neural networks (GNNs) and knowledge distillation (KG) are combined to leverage multiple graph structures for self-ensemble graph learning, effectively utilizing and learning item relationships from the student and teacher model. Furthermore, a multiple graph consistency constraint is introduced to align the student and teacher graphs in the feature embedding space, which enables the student model to learn more effectively from the teacher model by incorporating additional item relationships, leading to improved performance. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TSKD.","2025-04-24","2025-11-10 09:29:12","2025-11-10 09:29:12","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2025 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA)","","","","Cloud computing; Knowledge graphs; Data mining; Graph neural networks; Buildings; Knowledge engineering; Data models; Computational modeling; Analytical models; cross-session; graph neural networks; knowledge distillation; session-based recommendation; Stacking; teacher-student distillation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ontologies helps organize knowledge of a particular in a formal way. It is done by describing the concepts and the relationships between them. After the knowledge is organized, knowledge management systems can be used to find, connect, display, and even create new knowledge [4]. It uses semantic analysis to explain the information in a way that shows how different pieces of information are related to each other [4].

However, selecting and composing these services to generate optimal service graphs that meet user requirements is complex because it requires an expert with extensive knowledge of the cloud applications and their service composition, to manually generate service graphs. This, however, cannot often guarantee that all the requirements are met. A potentially promising approach to address this complexity is to develop a system that enables cloud users to specify their intent and then to automatically select a service graph that meets all their requirements. In this paper, we address the problem of service graph selection while considering both functional and non-functional requirements derived from user intent. Our objective is to minimize the total deployment cost of the service graph in a data center network and to determine its placement within the distributed data center network. We formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP), taking into account the bandwidth and latency requirements of user intent. To solve this, we propose our Service Graph Selection (SGS) solution, which aims to achieve a near-optimal solution in a computationally efficient manner.

Despite advancements in scheduling algorithms, existing methods face critical challenges, including suboptimal energy efficiency, limited adaptability to dynamic cloud environments, and insufficient context-aware decision-making. Recent techniques, such as Meta Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms, and Energy-Aware Scheduling, show potential but often struggle with high computational complexity, static resource allocation, or scalability issues. These shortcomings result in inefficient resource utilization, elevated energy usage, and difficulties in meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Energy Efficient Semantic Scheduling Framework (ESSF), a novel approach combining semantic reasoning and energy profiling to optimize task scheduling in dynamic cloud environments. The framework integrates three key components: (1) Dynamic Energy Profiling (DEP) for real-time energy monitoring, (2) Semantic Resource Matching (SRM) utilizing knowledge graphs for context-aware allocation, and (3) Adaptive Workload Balancing (AWB) to dynamically redistribute tasks for improved resource utilization and energy efficiency. Experiments using the Google Cluster Trace Dataset demonstrate that ESSF reduces energy consumption by up to 25% compared to traditional methods while achieving 90% resource utilization and 97% SLA compliance. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to overcome existing limitations, offering a scalable, adaptive, and environmentally sustainable solution for task scheduling in cloud computing.","2025-02-18","2025-11-10 09:29:12","2025-11-10 09:36:38","","274-281","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2025 4th International Conference on Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning (ICSADL)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 4; Conference name: 4th International Conference on Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning, ICSADL 2025; Conference location: Bhimdatta</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud-computing; Cloud computing; Knowledge graphs; Semantics; Energy; Dynamic energy; Dynamic energy profiling; Dynamic Energy Profiling; Energy Efficiency; Energy profiling; Google cluster trace dataset; Google Cluster Trace Dataset; Google+; Knowledge Graphs; Semantic scheduling; Semantic Scheduling; Tasks scheduling; Resource management; Dynamic scheduling; Service level agreements; Energy efficiency; Real-time systems; Energy consumption; Processor scheduling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025 4th International Conference on Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning (ICSADL)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, security measures, often implemented late in the engineering process, lead to costly and complicated implementations. Thus, this article is concerned with the “security by design” principle in ICSs and facilitates compliance with ICS security standards, which can be legally mandated for some critical systems or adopted by asset owners to protect their assets. Current methods for compliance demand manual efforts from security experts, making the compliance process time-consuming and costly. To address this, we propose a framework for leveraging large language models (LLMs) combined with knowledge graphs to automate the interpretation of security requirements and system architecture as two main elements of the design phase. Our knowledge graph-augmented LLM framework converts system architectures into human natural language, enhancing the automation of various security analyses, especially those that need to handle textual requirements. The framework enables validating applicable security requirements provided by IEC 62443-3-3 (a widely-used ICS security standard) concerning system designs through a question-and-answer interface. To evaluate the framework, various questions with reference responses from human experts were prepared in the context of a use case, and the quality of the LLMs' responses was measured across various metrics. Moreover, we compared the framework with a baseline approach based on formal queries. The results show that the proposed framework effectively automates security tasks and offers a user-friendly interface accessible to nonexperts.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:12","2025-11-10 09:29:12","","380-395","","","6","","IEEE Open Journal of the Industrial Electronics Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge graphs; Natural languages; ontology; Security; Ontologies; knowledge graph; security by design; Systems architecture; Cognition; IEC Standards; Computer security; Cyberattack; Industrial control system (ICS); large language model (LLM); Large language models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To solve this, we first design a decentralized multi-committee attribute-based encryption, X-ABE, to address the weak decentralization and low fault tolerance in Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE). X-ABE replaces MA-ABE’s fragile attribute authorities with robust attribute committees, each composed of multiple nodes. By developing dual-wrapped shares techniques, we address the increased dimensionality challenge of secret sharing while maintaining only 1 distributed key generation instance. Also, a formal security definition and proof under the partial adaptive model are given using dual system encryption. Second, X-LOCK, an X-ABE based decentralized access control utilizing consensus plus sharding, is proposed for Web 3.0, to achieve full decentralization, consistency, fault tolerance, user autonomy, and scalability. Third, X-ABE-R is proposed for attribute revocation and is demonstrated in X-LOCK-R with sharding blockchain as an immutable revocation ledger. Fourth, a formal definition and comparative analysis of X-ABE’s fault tolerance abilities are demonstrated, covering aspects of liveness and safety, along with the complexity analysis.

Exploiting auxiliary information such as a Knowledge Graph (KG) can significantly improve the effectiveness of service recommendations. However, current KG-based service recommendation methods usually merely integrate the knowledge semantic information into the user-service interaction model, which ignores the importance of global structure and does not fully consider the in-depth learning of individual user preferences. To this end, this paper proposes a Multi-Level View Contrastive Learning for Service Recommendation (MCSR) approach to address the above challenges. In particular, unlike traditional approaches that consider only two views, we consider three views, i.e., the global structure view, the local collaboration view, and the semantic view. Specifically, the user-service graph is regarded as the collaboration view, the service-entity graph as the semantic view, and the user-service-entity graph as the structural view. By applying contrastive learning across these views at different levels, MCSR fully leverages graph features and structural information, integrating auxiliary relational semantics into user-service interaction modeling. Furthermore, recognizing that the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly improving recommendation accuracy., since the influence of auxiliary information on interactions varies between users and services, a meta-network strategy enables adaptive, personalized knowledge transfer across views, significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy. The experimental results show that MCSR significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, with the positive impact of its key components on the recommended performance verified by ablation experiments.","2025-04","2025-11-10 09:29:12","2025-11-10 09:35:15","","1690-1702","","2","22","","IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

Most existing completion methods rely on entity text, images, and triplet information, ignoring the relationship path information between entities. In addition, due to the heterogeneity between text and images, there is often semantic conflict, and directly fusing information from different modalities makes it difficult to accurately capture the deep associations between text and images. Therefore, we propose a multimodal knowledge graph completion method based on relationship path enhancement with multi feature deep fusion.

By building a knowledge base, operators can quickly retrieve the information they need, significantly improving the speed and accuracy of problem solving. With the development of artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology, the O&M knowledge base can also provide intelligent services and applications, such as intelligent search, automatic fault diagnosis, and intelligent recommendation, to improve user experience and efficiency. However, implementing these features requires solving complex technical problems such as semantic understanding, knowledge reasoning, and so on. Based on the current cloud platform O&M knowledge system and business model, this paper constructs a multi-dimensional cloud platform O&M knowledge base, mines the knowledge association relationship with the help of natural language processing technology, and forms a visual knowledge graph network covering the whole domain of the cloud platform.

Platforms accelerate the development and deployment of DTs and services and ensure their resilient operation in order to capture especially all relevant shop-floor information, for example to aggregate PCFs, CCFs, and DPPs or to report on sustainability - automatically. However, platform operators should in particular avoid cloud provider lock-ins to be able to react flexibly to use case requirements at any time. The technology must be manageable and costs must be controllable. The aim is to achieve a break-even point between security, costs, future viability and controllability, short implementation time and motivated use. Such requirements can currently only be met with cloud infrastructures. An agnostic design ensures that switching infrastructures is possible and can be done both securely and quickly. To this end, this paper develops an out-of-the-box cloud native and cloud agnostic DT platform providing specialized, stateless, loosely coupled DT services interacting within a service mesh.

As researchers navigate through Web 3.0, the criticality of secure data sharing becomes evident, necessitating a robust solution to address vulnerabilities present in current methods. The existing methods grapple with vulnerabilities, especially in centralized repositories susceptible to breaches due to intricate and less secure authentication processes. Furthermore, the compromise of data integrity and privacy during the process of data sharing exacerbates the challenges faced by current methods. This research conducts a thorough examination of the pivotal role played by blockchain in enhancing security measures and empowering consumers with control over their data. Furthermore, it introduces a novel approach by proposing a secure Web 3.0 data-sharing platform, leveraging IPFS, Pinata, Smart Contracts, Meta Masks, and decentralized principles. To evaluate the security of the proposed secure data sharing platform, this study utilized two smart contract vulnerability detector tools, namely Slither and Echidna. The findings revealed a minimal presence of issues, with Slither identifying only five low-level, nonthreatening problems and Echidna indicating no critical failures.

Some M2M systems take into account node mobility, while some M2M systems regard vehicles as compute servers. N one of them, however, handle the mobility of nodes that act as compute servers. This paper proposes an MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) based M2M system called MECM2M, which can handle the mobility of nodes acting as sensors/actuators and compute servers. The design policy of MECM2M is analogous to that of the Internet. The Internet provides two fundamental services: reliable byte stream and unreliable datagram. How data is used is up to applications. MECM2M provides M2M applications with three fundamental services as the M2M services: area-based data acquisition, node-based data acquisition, and node-based action instruction. How sensing data is used is up to M2M applications. MECM2M introduces the virtual nodes as digital twins in the virtual space for the physical nodes. The virtual nodes conceal differences from the physical nodes and provide a uniform interface. The relation among the virtual nodes, the physical nodes, and the locations of the physical nodes is managed by a domain ontology called Onto- Mecm2m,which enables effective processing of the three fundamental services. The evaluation results on an MECM2M emulator show that the response times of the three fundamental services satisfy the latency constraints, i.e., 100 ms, defined in an ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) document.","2024-07-02","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","765-775","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2024 IEEE 48th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)","","","","Cloud computing; Containers; Software; Computer architecture; Data acquisition; digital twins; ETSI; loT; M2M; Machine-to-machine communications; MEC; mobility support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 IEEE 48th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through multiple experiments, it has been verified that a single pre-training model is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of current entity alignment tasks. Based on considerations of multiple pre-training models, this paper proposes an entity alignment method that utilizes multiple pre-training models. The purpose of this method is to address the limited accuracy in entity alignment tasks, with a particular focus on separately pre-training the embedding of entity attribute information and link relationship information for matching. To achieve the goal of improving entity alignment accuracy, this paper adopts joint alignment using pre-training with BERT and GloVe word embeddings. Experimental evaluations are conducted on the DBP15k dataset, and the results demonstrate that leveraging multiple pre-training models for attribute and relationship joint alignment can enhance model performance.

The number of “new cloud providers, applications, facilities, management systems, and data” has significantly increased in recent years. The complexity that has resulted from this expansion emphasises the need for new technology in order to efficiently manage and support these varied and many services and resources.

Keyword search stands out as a crucial task in the analysis and mining of these graphs. However, graph data owners tend to outsource storage and computation tasks to the cloud due to limited computing and storage resources. In this case, it is critical to ensure the integrity of the query results, as the cloud may have an incentive to return tampered results to serve its own interests. Currently, blockchain systems can store data efficiently and securely, creating a decentralized, tamper-proof digital platform. This functionality positions blockchain as a crucial complement and enhancement to traditional cloud storage solutions. Mainstream blockchains use a hybrid storage system to improve scalability, storing small meta-data on-chain and outsourcing raw data off-chain. While cryptographic proofs protect data integrity for queries, current schemes only support key-value data. This paper pioneers the study of authenticated keyword searches on graphs in hybrid-storage blockchains. The key challenge is to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) based on the graph data that can efficiently deal with keyword search queries. We propose Merkle Path DAG (MP-DAG), a novel ADS that aggregates the unqualified paths that will not appear in the result trees to efficiently handle authenticated keyword search queries on graphs. Furthermore, to reduce the ADS storage cost, we design an optimization scheme MP-DAG* by combining the similar subgraphs of MP-DAG. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed ADS and optimization measure.","2024-05-13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","1958-1971","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2024 IEEE 40th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","","","","Cloud computing; Knowledge graphs; Keyword search; Social networking (online); Costs; Scalability; Blockchains; n/a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 IEEE 40th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the inherently cross-layered nature of failure scenarios on these platforms, identifying the root causes presents a significant challenge. Alarm association rule mining has become an effective means to address the problems of alarm correlation and root cause localization. In this paper, an explainable alarm association rule mining approach based on knowledge graph, referred to as ARK-G, is proposed. Initially, a cloud-network cross-layer alarm association knowledge graph (CA2KG) is constructed. Subsequently, the knowledge embedding based graph convolutional network is employed to perform knowledge graph embedding on CA2KG. This embedding is then utilized to enhance the RNNLogic algorithm, thereby facilitating cross-layer alarm association rule mining with interpretable paths. Finally, a weighted rule tree is derived from a subset of CA2KG and the generated explainable rules, enabling the deduction of the root alarm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ARK-G approach for association rule mining yields a higher hit rate compared to the baseline model, which provides valuable assistance in the faults analysis of 5 G cloud-network platforms.","2024-05-27","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","400-405","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2024 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)","","","","Cloud computing; Knowledge graphs; knowledge graph; root cause analysis; Neural networks; Reviews; graph neural networks; alarm association rule; Cross layer design; Location awareness; network intelligence; Wireless networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their inherent complexity and the intricate interplay of internal components heighten the risk of sporadic and unforeseen anomalies. To address these challenges, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is employed to accurately identify problematic services (pods) and mine the precise faults behind observed anomalies. Tailored to the limitations of conventional RCA algorithms, we propose a novel approach that jointly models operation entities and their relationships as learnable embeddings. Additionally, this method integrates fault propagation information to further improve RCA accuracy. Our evaluation involves developing a prototype within the Kubernetes cloud-native system.

Containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes offer standardized and efficient approaches for packaging, deploying, and managing applications in distributed environments. The need to bridge the gap between different heterogeneous systems and to ensure meaningful communication between the systems is where the semantic representation mechanism plays an important role. This mechanism is essential to a shared language and meaning, enabling effective communication and collaboration. Using Docker for containerization we can encapsulate these semantically enriched heterogeneous systems in isolated environments, ensuring their seamless deployment and management. This ensures that sensor reading and user notifications are effectively exchanged between different components in the system. As a container orchestration platform, Kubernetes enables autoscaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance, and ensures high availability and reliability of Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (MHEWS), even if the infrastructure fails. This enables easy integration and interoperability of various software components and increases system scalability and reliability. In this study, we detail architectural design and implementation considerations for the Multi-Hazard Early Warning System, with a focus on using semantic middleware and containerization technologies, we will explore how the technologies can improve data interoperability and improve system performance.","2024-05-20","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","01-12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2024 IST-Africa Conference (IST-Africa)","","","","Semantics; Docker; Kubernetes; Software reliability; Smart contracts; Scalability; Blockchains; Solids; Alarm systems; Containerization; Multi-Hazard Early Warning System; Semantic Middleware","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 IST-Africa Conference (IST-Africa)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gaps in monitoring can lead to delay in incident detection and significant negative customer impact. Current process of monitor creation is ad-hoc and reactive in nature. Developers create monitors using their tribal knowledge and, primarily, a trial and error based process. As a result, monitors often have incomplete coverage which leads to production issues, or, redundancy which results in noise and wasted effort. In this work, we address this issue by proposing an intelli-gent monitoring framework that recommends monitors for cloud services based on their service properties. We start by mining the attributes of 30,000+ monitors from 791 production services at Microsoft and derive a structured ontology for monitors. We focus on two crucial dimensions: what to monitor (resources) and which metrics to monitor. We conduct an extensive empirical study and derive key insights on the major classes of monitors employed by cloud services at Microsoft, their associated dimensions, and the interrelationship between service properties and this ontology. Using these insights, we propose a deep learning based framework that recommends monitors based on the service properties. Finally, we conduct a user study with engineers from Microsoft which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed framework. The proposed framework along with the ontology driven projections, succeeded in creating production quality rec-ommendations for majority of resource classes. This was also validated by the users from the study who rated the framework's usefulness as 4.27 out of 5.","2024-04-14","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:35:55","","381-391","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2024 IEEE/ACM 46th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 44th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results, ICSE-SEIP 2024; Conference location: Lisbon</p>","","","Cloud computing; Ontology; Deep learning; Cloud services; Ontology's; Ontologies; Cloud Services; Data-driven approach; High availability; High reliability; Incident detection; Intelligent monitoring; Intelligent Monitoring; MicroSoft; Monitoring frameworks; Reliability; Service properties; Measurement; Production; Delays; Noise; Termination of employment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 IEEE/ACM 46th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, transferring personal information to the cloud raises several privacy concerns. The transition to the next generation of networks requires the highest level of security for users' personal data, necessitating a revision of current methods for its transmission and storage as well as the adoption of new cryptographic approaches. Homomorphic encryption is one such method that allows calculations to be performed on encrypted data without requiring the decryption of these data. This approach solves the problem of securely transmitting and storing personal information while still allowing for the required calculations to be made. This article will focus on the implementation of a homomorphic encryption scheme (Gentry et al.) using the advanced computing power of modern PCs. To track the dynamics of growth in implementation efficiency, an identical experiment was conducted on devices of different generations of the MacBook Air line. The results were compared with software implementations using Intel Core i5 processors and Apple M2 processors.

However, existing applications on the Internet, such as serve computing, and edge computing, have highly complex technical requirements. These applications face compatibility issues with the metaverse in terms of protocols, applications, and services. So they cannot be directly integrated into the metaverse. How to efficiently deploy service computing in the metaverse has become a hotspot research area. Moreover, metaverse implements innovative services to offer individuals more immersive experiences, such as acrlong VR services and augmented Reality services. These new services demand high-computational resources, including computing power, network performance, data security, etc. Ensuring optimal service quality for these new services in the metaverse is another critical aspect of metaverse research. To address the aforementioned challenges, Meta-services, designed to describe, discover, compose, and manage other services, are gradually attracting widespread attention and research. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review, analysis, and discussion of existing research work. We summarize the services computing and novel services in metaverse and categorize the meta-services framework into three layers: 1) meta-bottom layer (meta-data); 2) meta-middle layer (meta-models, meta-objects, and meta-languages); and 3) meta-top layer (meta-programming).

Within the realm of personalized course-learning services, large amounts of online course recommendation systems have been developed to cater to the diverse needs of learners. However, despite these advancements, there still exist three unsolved challenges: 1) how to effectively utilize the course information spanning from the title-level to the more granular keyword-level; 2) how to well capture the sequential information among learning courses; 3) how to identify the high-correlated courses in the course corpora. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solution known as Cascaded Knowledge-level Fusion Network (CKFN) for online course recommendation with incorporating a three-fold approach to maximize the utilization of course information: 1) two knowledge graphs spanning from the keyword-level to title-level; 2) a two-stage attention fusion mechanism; 3) a novel knowledge-aware negative sampling method. Experimental results on a real dataset of XuetangX demonstrate that CKFN surpasses existing baseline models by a substantial margin, thereby achieving the state-of-the-art recommendation performance. It means that CKFN can be potentially deployed into MOOCs platforms as a pivotal component to provide personalized course recommendation service.","2024-08","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","457-469","","4","10","","IEEE Transactions on Big Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge graphs; Recommender systems; Deep learning; knowledge graph; Data mining; Task analysis; Big Data; Feature extraction; recommendation system; Fans; online course recommendation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces “Dynastic Nexus,” an advanced genealogy platform designed to navigate complex hierarchies of relationships, perform network analysis, and dynamically visualize family trees. Users explore generations and diverse kinship routes, unraveling the complexities of extended family networks. Its user-centric interface imports genealogical data, extracts profiles, and provides a personalised approach by displaying the family tree from that particular individual's perspective, offering insights into one's heritage and allowing for a deeper understanding of their place within the family. Employing advanced graph algorithms, “Dynastic Nexus” conducts in-depth connection analysis, revealing intricate relationships like parent-child, spousal, and sibling connections. Unique links such as cousins, nieces, and aunts add depth to understanding extended family dynamics. We also include a case study of determining relationships in Indian families, which tend to be more complex due to various social, cultural, and historical factors.

This interest is growing with the apparition of Cloud applications that are being increasingly available and diversified trying to cover a multitude of services to satisfy the unlimited end-user requirements. In front of applications diversity, it become more difficult for end-user to find the most adequate service that perfectly meet their needs especially when considering personalization in WSC process. This difficulty increases when dealing with security constraints, especially in cloud environment where services are openly accessible and widely exposed to highly potential risks. In such context, WSC must be made in a careful way and personalization should proactively take into account protection measures against all eventual threats. Otherwise, integrating both personalization and security in WSC may result in an instable system.Based on this conviction, finding the correlation between these concepts remains an important issue. Hence, the key challenge of this paper is to study the stability system’s through a correlation equation between the precited concepts.

Currently, the cloud storage market is highly dominated by centralized players like Amazon S3, Google Cloud, Box, etc. Decentralized projects like Storj, Filecoin, and Sia have seen rising popularity with the advent of Web 3.0 applications. At the same time, any blockchain network is susceptible to large-scale DDoS attacks. This work focuses on the Storj DCS, where we aimed to analyze the robustness of the system under the influence of a coordinated DDoS attack which can be carried out by an adversary or a group of adversaries taking down a set of storage nodes. The novelty of our work lies in threefold: First, we use statistical methods to mathematically model the content distribution as well as the loss of a file or a segment from the system. Our model captures both the cases where we have homogeneous and non-homogeneous nodes. Secondly, we develop a cost-analytic approach to perform a robustness analysis of the Storj system and implement the proposed model in MATLAB. Finally, we calculate the cost of a DDoS attack that the adversary has to incur in order to be successful with the attack.

In this paradigm, knowledge graphs play a pivotal role by supplying vital background information and contextual understanding to hybrid intelligence systems. However, due to limitations in local storage capacity, managing large-scale graph data often requires outsourcing to cloud servers. Nevertheless, the use of untrusted cloud servers poses a risk of potential user data leaks. To address these concerns, this paper presents an encryption scheme specifically designed to protect graph data, enabling queries involving intermediate nodes in the shortest path between two nodes within the graph. The proposed scheme ensures the privacy and security of outsourced data by employing a novel method that utilizes padding dictionary structure encryption. This method ensures strict limitations on the cloud server's capabilities, restricting it solely to query operations, it effectively prevents any compromise of user data or unauthorized access to sensitive information, users can securely store and process their graph data on servers, significantly reducing the potential risk of data leakage and unauthorized breaches. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution, practical experiments were conducted using real-world data.","2023-11-17","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:36:36","","8204-8208","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 China Automation Congress (CAC)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.

In order to meet these needs, cloud computing technologies have surfaced as a suitable answer, facilitating effective data sharing and interchange. With semantic information integration playing a crucial role, this is especially important for fully exploiting the advantages of cloud computing in enabling sophisticated analytics and mining for smart grids. In order to analyze grid data for power distribution, this essay proposes integrating the semantic web into a cloud-based research platform. The idea recommends using a service restoration technique to reenergize loads after an electrical failure. This presentation is implemented using FIWARE, a platform composed of modular, open-source building pieces designed for future internet services and applications. Moreover, the SARGON ontology-which was created especially for the energy domain-is used here. We test the integration of semantic data into the cloud-based service restoration application using the IEC61850 data model. This integration provides an access to the distribution grid's field devices. The platform's performance test, measured in terms of computing time and network latency, validates the viability of the suggested solution. The results of these experiments provide as a standard against which to measure the performance of smart energy platforms in the future, therefore advancing the field.","2023-12-19","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:35:33","","1295-1299","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 International Conference on Power Energy, Environment & Intelligent Control (PEEIC)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2023 International Conference on Power Energy, Environment and Intelligent Control, PEEIC 2023; Conference location: Greater Noida</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Cloud-computing; Cloud computing; Semantics; Cloud-based; Ontology; Ontology's; Time measurement; Data integration; Integration; Heuristic algorithms; Distribution management systems; Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Fault Location Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR) and Distribution Management Systems (DMS); Fault location isolation and service restoration and distribution management system; Location based services; Restoration; SARGON ontology; SARGON Ontology; Service distribution; Service restoration; Service Restoration; Smart grid; Smart Grid; Smart power grids; Data models; Performance evaluation; Web and internet services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 International Conference on Power Energy, Environment & Intelligent Control (PEEIC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, although AI and chatbots have become increasingly sophisticated, they may not always be able to handle complex or nuanced customer issues. Human agents can better understand and respond to these situations, providing tailored solutions. At the same time, solving non-trivial customer problems often requires access to knowledge bases and contextual customer information, for which AI is particularly well suited. Hence the idea of integrating human and artificial intelligence in a hybrid solution. We developed an AI system to help human assistants in the process of handling conversations. This system can be viewed as a collaborative bot (cobot). The cobot captures the audio stream of the conversation, converts it to text and analyzes it in real time. The extracted tokens are classified and sent to a reasoning system based on a knowledge graph, that provides information and action suggestions to the human assistant. Assistants are also capable of providing information to the reasoning system, utilizing their human understanding of the client's circumstances as they unfold. While designing a prototypical solution for utility services, we have faced the problem of real-time use of computationally complex procedures, including spontaneous speech understanding and knowledge-based heuristic rules. Moreover, we adopted a standards-based approach and experimented with open source reasoners and publicly available language models.

Consequently, cloud security has become a heavily discussed topic in the industry. If cloud assets are misconfigured, it can lead to severe security issues and be exposured to cybersecurity attacks. It is of great importance that industry practitioners understand the security challenges and their responsibilities to protect cloud assets. We designed a serious game: Cloud of Assets and Threats (CATS) as an enrichment to the traditional training method to empower users of the cloud infrastructure in terms of cloud security awareness. In this work, we propose a new ontology-based model to support the evaluation of the simulated attack scenarios in CATS. We share the implementation details and the algorithm, based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which is used in CATS to evaluate the simulated attack scenarios. With this innovative effort, we maximize the level to which the CATS game reflects real-world facts, and provide a reasonable level of abstraction in the serious game. Our work contributes to the body of knowledge by extending the existing ontology and applying it in the evaluator algorithm, which stands at the core of our serious game CATS. We apply CATS in training in the industry and discovered that CATS is a promising approach to help the industry practitioners to understand cloud security concepts and raise awareness about cloud security.

Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) spend hours leveraging multiple sources of data, including the alerts, error logs, and domain expertise through past experiences to locate the root cause(s). These experiences are documented as natural language text in outage reports for previous outages. However, utilizing the raw yet rich semi-structured information in the reports systematically is time-consuming. Structured information, on the other hand, such as alerts that are often used during fault diagnosis, is voluminous and requires expert knowledge to discern. Several strategies have been proposed to use each source of data separately for root cause analysis. In this work, we build a diagnostic service called ESRO that recommends root causes and remediation for failures by utilizing structured as well as semi-structured sources of data systematically. ESRO constructs a causal graph using alerts and a knowledge graph using outage reports, and merges them in a novel way to form a unified graph during training. A retrieval based mechanism is then used to search the unified graph and rank the likely root causes and remediation techniques based on the alerts fired during an outage at inference time. Not only the individual alerts, but their respective importance in predicting an outage group is taken into account during recommendation. We evaluated our model on several cloud service outages of a large SaaS enterprise over the course of ~2 years, and obtained an average improvement of 27% in rouge scores after comparing the likely root causes against the ground truth over state-of-the-art baselines. We further establish the effectiveness of ESRO through qualitative analysis on multiple real outage examples.","2023-09-11","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","255-267","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)","","","","Knowledge graphs; Natural languages; Knowledge Graph; Root cause analysis; Cloud Services; Fault diagnosis; Software as a service; Training; Reliability engineering; Causal Graph; System Monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A myriad of applications and tool sets are offered to automate the analysis of large cyber data sets. Semantic Web's community has been studying the field of cybersecurity for over a decade and produced numerous knowledge graphs and frameworks. The Unified Cybersecurity Ontology (UCO) connected many of the leading knowledge representation frameworks, providing a holistic mapping of cyber data, beginning in 2016. MITRE ATT&CK is used by a wide variety of practitioners to understand how their current data and tooling prepare them to defend against both Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and less formal threat actors. The UCO and MITRE ATT&CK have provided researchers and practitioners, respectively, with tools to standardize data collection, correlation, and analysis. However, it is not apparent how current knowledge graphs and their applications in the cybersecurity domain utilize ATT&CK.

Using this information to recommend satisfactory cloud products is a challenge. Previous studies focused on similar information of users and products while neglecting relevance; therefore, they could not create recommendation approaches that account for functional dependencies among cloud products. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a cloud product set recommendation model based on a hierarchical knowledge graph (KG) with a pre-post correlation of product functionality. There are two main contributions: First, we constructed a cloud product functionality and performance KG using the dependency information of layers and entities to represent complicated pre-post logical connections. The KG was designed according to the cloud service model. Second, we designed an improved PageRank algorithm to obtain the importance weight for each functionality and performance, which replaces the original average method with the proportion of connection weight. We considered the release time of the functionality, launch time of the product, and last update time of the product as crucial factors in the recommendation score to reflect the importance of the functionality and current development stage of the product. Finally, our method recommended a product set based on the weighted scores from the above results. In addition, we constructed a cloud product functionality dataset containing 339 functionalities. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate a closely related set of products, leading to improved accuracy and higher satisfaction compared to mainstream methods.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:36:17","","120541-120553","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: S.

The increase in information and communication technologies has, however, rendered smart grids vulnerable to cyberattacks. This position paper presents an ontological model of smart grid systems that elucidates the entities involved and their interrelationships, enabling systematic identification of attack surfaces and vectors. We augment this model by providing an automated method to integrate the vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database – an expanding catalog of over 200,000 cybersecurity vulnerabilities maintained by the MITRE Corporation – to the specified smart grid components in the ontology. By populating the ontology with relevant CVE database entries, we provide an enriched understanding that guides vulnerability assessment and security policy design in smart grid systems. Furthermore, we introduce an automation framework to generate security policies, leveraging the machine-readability of our ontology. This research is expected to promote collaboration among various stakeholders, ranging from developers and operators to regulators, fostering enhanced smart grid security.","2023-10-02","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","","","","Network security; Knowledge based systems; Ontologies; Databases; Systematics; Meters; Regulators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is attracting attentions from academia and industries to based on Web 3.0 construct infrastructures to provide services for participants. Blockchain is a key technology to implement Web 3.0, which can record data and prevent data mutations in a secure and decentralized way. Since Web 3.0 is an integration of multiple technologies, blockchain is required to frequently interact with them, which challenges the throughput of consensus. An efficient consensus algorithm plays an important role to support Web 3.0 infrastructures and services. However, current researches on consensus algorithms require large-scale nodes to participate and switch view frequently, which causes high communication overheads and long consensus delays. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an incentive-based blockchain consensus mechanism for Web 3.0, called CD-PBFT, to improve efficiency and record consensus quality to regulate behaviors of nodes. Since nodes with higher incentives and qualities are selected as the primary nodes frequently to reduce view switching, a cooling mechanism is introduced to prevent these nodes dominating the consensus process. Moreover, a K-medoids-based clustering mechanism is elaborated to form a multi-cluster network to reduce the amount of nodes required for consensus. Simulation results prove that the proposed consensus mechanism can prevent centralization on the primary nodes, and reduce communication overheads and consensus delays.","2023-06-26","2025-11-10 09:29:13","2025-11-10 09:29:13","","441-448","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 IEEE International Conference on Metaverse Computing, Networking and Applications (MetaCom)","","","","Semantic Web; Blockchain; Consensus; Web 3.0; Simulation; Industries; Consensus algorithm; Metaverse; Cooling; Incentive; PBFT; Switches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 IEEE International Conference on Metaverse Computing, Networking and Applications (MetaCom)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The original association rule has a limited ability to identify references related to a keyword, only focusing on the closest ones, which can lead to incomplete and inaccurate results. The proposed method overcomes this limitation by categorizing different types of references based on the research subject, which enables the identification of relevant references that are not immediately adjacent. The reliability of different categories is calculated based on the event table, and candidate records undergo procedures such as aggregation and screening to eliminate less reliable records. The feasibility of this method is evaluated by comparing it with numerous association rule processes in the marketplace. The results show that the proposed method has a significant advantage over other algorithms, with a data correlation rate that remains stable at 80%. Moreover, this study emphasizes the importance of Linked Data technology in publishing and sharing data online. Linked Data provides a lightweight and incremental data transfer model, which makes it an ideal way to integrate resources into the information flow continuously.

In existing works, external knowledge has been proven effective to improve the ABSA tasks’ performance. However, it is still essential to study further to find a universal method for ABSA tasks. Therefore, we propose an external knowledge-injected graph convolutional network (EKIGCN) to enhance the sentiment representation with commonsense. Specifically, Sentic Net is leveraged to provide external knowledge to construct an affective dependency graph. In order to fully exploit the effectiveness of affective knowledge, a shallow mutual interaction is utilized to fuse the learned contextual representation and the graph. Besides, to make EKIGCN sensitive to aspect terms, an aspect-aware multi-head attention module is also employed to enhance the corresponding relations between aspect and contextual words.

Within this work, we present our approach for a monitoring intervention inside a factory space utilizing both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), based primarily on edge computing, while also utilizing the cloud. We discuss its main design directions, as well as a basic ontology to aid in simple description of factory assets. In order to highlight the design aspects of our approach, we present a prototype implementation, based on a use case scenario in a factory site, within the context of the EnerMan H2020 project.","2023-07-18","2025-11-10 09:29:14","2025-11-10 09:29:14","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 IEEE 21st International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","","","","Cloud computing; Ontologies; edge computing; Industry 4.0; Industries; Prototypes; Production facilities; augmented reality; extended reality; Fluids; Fourth Industrial Revolution; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 IEEE 21st International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The traditional method of learning which is completely text-based takes more time to understand. Students must learn more in less time and also have good knowledge of the concepts which are not only present in the textbooks, but also from external sources. Visual learning techniques are the most well-known effective way to learn more information in less time. When information is presented visually, it is easy to understand the concepts and remember them for a long time. The knowledge graph is used to represent the information with the relationship between the different topics in a visually comprehensive manner. Our project aims in helping students to learn visually with the help of knowledge graphs (or concept maps). The Graphs for various subjects will be available separately and can be used by students to learn interactively. Our project is mainly focused on subjects from the computer science domain. For the knowledge graph construction, the required data is scraped from the internet using Wikipedia and Google Knowledge APIs. Natural language processing (NLP) is used to process scrapped data from the internet which is then processed using a graph database to display the knowledge graph with the data and the relationship connecting the data. All graphs are made in such a way to make a visual impact on learners such that it is easy to read and interpret.","2023-06-16","2025-11-10 09:29:14","2025-11-10 09:29:14","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2023 2nd International Conference on Advancements in Electrical, Electronics, Communication, Computing and Automation (ICAECA)","","","","Knowledge graphs; Natural language processing; Visualization; Educational technology; Databases; Computer science; Data Scraping; Encyclopedias; MRotatE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 2nd International Conference on Advancements in Electrical, Electronics, Communication, Computing and Automation (ICAECA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These manifest as chaotic management of mental health care, a lack of hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) knowledge among medical staff, and unskilled practical operation. These factors result in suboptimal decision-making and emergency response execution. Consequently, we have developed a digital-based emergency prevention and control system to reinforce IPC management in psychiatric hospitals and enhance the hospital IPC capabilities of medical staff. Methods: The system incorporates modern technologies such as cloud computing, big data, streaming media, and knowledge graphs. A cloud service platform was established at the PaaS layer using Docker container technology to manage infectious disease emergency-related services. The system provides application services to various users through a Browser/Server Architecture. The system was implemented in a class A tertiary mental health center from March 1st, 2022, to February 28th, 2023. Twelve months of emergency IPC training and education were conducted based on the system. The system’s functions and the users’ IPC capabilities were evaluated. Results: A total of 116 employees participated in using the system. The system performance evaluation indicated that functionality (3.78 ± 0.68), practicality (4.02 ± 0.74), reliability (3.45 ± 0.50), efficiency (4.14 ± 0.69), accuracy (3.36 ± 0.58), and assessability (3.05 ± 0.47) met basic levels (> 3), with efficiency improvement and practicality achieving a good level (> 4). After 12 months of training and study based on the system, the participants demonstrated improved emergency knowledge (χ2 = 37.69, p < 0.001) and skills (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that the digital-based emergency IPC system has the potential to enhance the emergency IPC knowledge base and operational skills of medical personnel in psychiatric hospitals. Furthermore, the medical personnel appear to be better adapted to the system. Consequently, the system has the capacity to facilitate the emergency IPC response of psychiatric institutions to infectious diseases, while simultaneously optimising the training and educational methodologies employed in emergency prevention and control. The promotion and application of this system in psychiatric institutions has the potential to accelerate the digitalisation and intelligence construction of psychiatric hospitals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:20","2025-11-10 09:29:20","","","","1","25","","BMC Med.

In this context, automated code generation plays a pivotal role in accelerating cloud-native application development. However, existing studies often overlook the full potential of leveraging multiple program representations, typically focusing on a single form derived from well-structured programs. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating multiple program representations, specifically, code snippets and their associated ASTs can significantly enhance code generation for cloud-native applications. We construct a code knowledge graph (CodeKG) to retrieve related programs based on textual and structural similarities, enabling richer contextual information for generation. To realize this integration, we design a framework that employs shared-retentive networks (shared-RetNet) and an AST-based Transformer to extract and align features from natural language, code tokens, and ASTs. By applying contrastive loss and cross-attention mechanisms, our method effectively fuses diverse modalities to strengthen code generation performance. Experiments on two processed open-source datasets demonstrate that our method, without relying on extensive pre-training, achieves superior results compared to existing pretrained models across BLEU-4, CodeBLEU, and ROUGE-L metrics, paving the way for more efficient and intelligent cloud-native software development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:20","2025-11-10 09:29:20","","","","1","14","","J.

However, the common practice of encryption can reduce data searchability. Semantic searchable encryption aims to support flexible queries over encrypted data and achieve efficient search while ensuring that search results match the user's search intent. Although semantic searchable encryption schemes have made progress, they still have limitations in properly balancing accuracy, efficiency, and security. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Enhanced Semantic Searchable Encryption (CESSE) scheme to achieve accurate and highly efficient secure semantic search over encrypted cloud data. To achieve it, we first adopt a context-enhanced pre-trained model component to mine the relevance between queries and documents by contrastive learning and obtain context-enhanced vector representations to improve search accuracy. Then, to ensure privacy protection, we utilize an optimized asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryption (optimized ASPE) algorithm to encrypt vectors before outsourcing to the cloud. Additionally, we construct the approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) index to accelerate vector searching. At last, we give a formal definition of security and theoretically prove the safety of our scheme under a more practical threat model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CESSE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better accuracy and efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:20","2025-11-10 09:29:20","","","","","719","","Inf Sci","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Inc.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.

Leveraging temporal information to provide contextual data for regions with low visibility or sparse observations has recently become a popular research direction, especially in autonomous driving. Existing methods, however, are often over-reliant on past frames, leading to cumulative errors (drift) caused by unconstrained frame-by-frame stacking. This paper proposes a dynamic alignment of historical frame memory information to ensure consistency with the observations of the current frame, reducing deviations caused by viewpoint changes or object movements and ensuring more accurate capture of current frame features. In addition, a new multi-scale feature fusion method, to the best of our knowledge, was introduced using the spatiotemporal (ST) method to extract the ST features, which reduces the inconsistencies between 2D range image coordinates and 3D Cartesian outputs. This approach enhances feature representation by optimizing and fusing the aligned channel features. This method was evaluated on the SemanticKITTI and SensatUrban datasets. The experimental results showed that it outperforms existing state-ofthe- art methods regarding accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:20","2025-11-10 09:29:20","","8068-8076","","27","64","","Appl.

Since designers show a clear tendency of professional trust in the knowledge adoption process, they are more inclined to accept knowledge resources recommended by people with similar professional backgrounds to theirs or by authorities in their fields. Therefore, this paper proposes a knowledge recommendation method for product form design integrating crowd-intelligence context similarity and trust relationships in cloud environments. The method first constructs an ontology model and a product form design knowledge ontology, containing task context, designer’s context, and computational context to facilitate the acquisition, storage, processing, and invocation of contextual information and knowledge. Second, the neighboring set of target designers is determined by calculating the multidimensional contextual similarity and trust relationship between designers. Finally, the missing knowledge score of the target designer is predicted by the knowledge evaluation of the neighboring designers, and the recommendation list is generated. The method’s effectiveness and feasibility are confirmed through a case study of coffee machine product form design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:20","2025-11-10 09:29:20","","","","17","15","","Appl.

Focusing on the symmetric encryption algorithm, it proposes a cloud computing data security transmission system, followed by model validation and simulation analysis. The key findings are as follows: (1) The use of a symmetric encryption algorithm ensures both user data security and the secure distribution of encryption keys. (2) The proposed encryption algorithm effectively conceals the distribution characteristics of explicit data, enhancing the information transmission security of the ship communication network. (3) The joint robust optimization algorithm outperforms other benchmark methods in terms of average safety rate.

A crucial property of these networks is maintaining consistent output results under random rotations of the input point cloud, namely, rotation invariance. The dominant approach achieves rotation invariance is to construct local coordinate systems for computing invariant local point cloud coordinates. However, this method neglects the relative pose relationships between local point cloud structures, leading to a decline in network performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Rotation-Invariant Point Cloud Transformer (RotInv-PCT). This method extracts the local abstract shape features of the point cloud using Local Reference Frames (LRFs) and explicitly computes the spatial relative pose features between local point clouds, both of which are proven to be rotation-invariant. Furthermore, to capture the long-range pose dependencies between points, we introduce an innovative Feature Aggregation Transformer (FAT) model, which seamlessly fuses the pose features with the shape features to obtain a globally rotation-invariant representation. Moreover, to manage large-scale point clouds, we utilize hierarchical random downsampling to gradually decrease the scale of point clouds, followed by feature aggregation through FAT. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RotInv-PCT, we conducted comparative experiments across various tasks and datasets, including point cloud classification on ScanObjectNN and ModelNet40, part segmentation on ShapeNet, and semantic segmentation on S3DIS and KITTI. Thanks to our provable rotation-invariant features and FAT, our method generally outperforms state-of-the-art networks. In particular, we highlight that RotInv-PCT achieved a 2% improvement in real-world point cloud classification tasks compared to the strongest baseline. Furthermore, in the semantic segmentation task, we improved the performance on the S3DIS dataset by 10% and, for the first time, realized rotation-invariant point cloud semantic segmentation on the KITTI dataset. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:20","2025-11-10 09:29:20","","","","","185","","Neural Netw.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: Z.

Given that the majority of achievements are only concentrated on keyword-based search, there is a clear need to explore secure semantic extension to enhance the utilization of information. Nevertheless, majority of secure semantic schemes mainly focus on the direct combination of traditional searchable encryption and semantic extension techniques, which results in the high computation and communication overheads for multi-keyword queries. Besides, to enhance the flexibility and extensibility of secure semantic search, some researchers have already proposed encryption methods for structured data. However, the effectiveness and practicality of these methods above are often limited by their rigid structure description and redundant index building. To handle these problems, we present a secure sublinear semantic search scheme based on the knowledge graph, which can achieve sublinear knowledge graph (KG) search and smart sentence queries concurrently. The knowledge graph encryption index is constructed with the same structure as the inverted index, thereby enabling sublinear efficiency. Furthermore, the system also offers functions for both node and edge semantic extension in the knowledge graph. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is adaptively secure and present a series of experiments to analyze its performance. The experimental results show that our scheme exhibits significant advantages in all computation, communication and expression situations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:20","2025-11-10 09:29:20","","","","","151","","Comput Secur","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: H.

Existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) are able to identify simple attacks instead of complex attacks. Complex attacks comprise multiple forms of attacks that can only be identified through reasoning and maintaining relationships between sensor nodes and patrol nodes in the network. Therefore, the given paper proposes a smart knowledge-based framework to detect intrusions in the given network with the use of ontology. The proposed framework begins with the capturing of live network packets, followed by the construction of ‘NETWORK TRAFFIC Ontology’ in order to represent the relationship between the captured packets and attributes associated with several nodes. The designed ontology serves as a knowledge base comprising a set of classes, properties, and instances in the context of packets captured from autonomous cloud computing environment. After this, the features from the designed ontology are extracted using semantic web rule language (SWRL) and Pellet reasoner. It is used to identify intrusion in the form of malicious packets in the network. Lastly, the performance of the proposed framework is validated against recent studies based on evaluation metrics such as attack estimation rate (AER), accuracy (%), and false alarm rate (FAR). The results show that the proposed framework outperforms the recent studies in terms of performance metrics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:20","2025-11-10 09:29:20","","1023-1030","","2","17","","Int.

Companies have been heavily adopting different cloud services and integrating them into their IT portfolios. Meanwhile, research has been striving to understand, articulate, and explore the cloud ecosystem. Using 13 expert interviews and 3 case studies, and while applying transaction costs theories, this research contributes to the explicitness of cloud computing. This paper introduces a new concept, that should be added to existing cloud computing ontologies: Meta-Services. The paper provides a working definition for cloud Meta-Services and explains their inter-relationships with other cloud services and available ontologies. It also discusses four examples of Meta-Services that emerge during the cloud adoption journey. This discussion and conceptualization of Meta-Services will help cloud customers make more informed decisions about their entire cloud adoption journey. It will also help cloud providers make more realistic promises to their customers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:20","2025-11-10 09:29:20","","195-207","","","536 LNBIP","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

However, the mechanism of efficient pectin accumulation remains unclear. Through transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, this study investigated the differentially expressed genes and proteins associated with pectin during various developmental stages of P. puberula. The combined omics approach revealed that the majority of differential genes are mainly involved in the anabolic metabolism of primary and secondary metabolites. Notable differential pathways include starch and sucrose metabolism, amino acid sugar metabolism, and nucleotide sugar metabolism. The SWEET gene family was identified and analyzed, leading to the cloning of PpSWEET15 and subcellular localization. Overexpression of PpSWEET15 resulted in a significant decrease in sucrose content in leaves from 134.44 μg·g−1 to <10 μg·g−1. Glucose content decreased from 407.75 μg·g−1 to 318.38 μg·g−1, while fructose levels showed no significant difference between the two groups of leaves.

A key challenge in malware detection lies in balancing the reduction of false positives with maintaining detection accuracy amid rapid software ecosystem evolution. Existing methods require substantial expert intervention to mitigate false positives and often neglect the resource-intensive measures required to address model degradation caused by software updates. This study introduces ASTBAR, a novel method that extracts fine-grained AST fragments to distill benign behavioral knowledge from webserver software. By leveraging program structure and semantic analysis, ASTBAR generates fragment-level representations of benign samples and employs fragment matching to identify malware. Unlike prior techniques, ASTBAR achieves simultaneous improvements in precision, recall, and adaptability to software evolution. The evaluation results demonstrate that ASTBAR achieves an F1 score of 65.35%, outperforming the state-of-theart methods by 10.39%. In a12-month industrial deployment spanning over one million users, ASTBAR maintained a 97.63% recall rat while reducing false positives by 700+ cases daily (equivalent to 30 expert hours). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

However, these environments limit the use of traditional cybersecurity frameworks and tools, compromising observability and situational awareness capabilities for security tasks (e.g., risk assessment, incident response). Additionally, existing security frameworks for serverless applications often lack generalizability across architectures and require specialized expertise. In this paper, we propose a three-layer security stack for fully managed serverless applications. The first layer establishes a foundational generic ontology that models serverless application resources and their interactions using API logs. In the second layer, the ontology is leveraged via perimeterless pipeline, to map the logs into a unified application activity KG, and in the third layer, two situational awareness tools that utilize the graph-based representation are implemented: (1) an incident response dashboard that leverages the ontology to visualize and examine application activity logs in the context of cybersecurity alerts; our user study showed that this dashboard enabled participants to respond 10% more accurately and almost twice as fast than the examined baseline tool, and (2) a criticality of asset (CoA) risk assessment framework that enables efficient expert-based prioritization in cybersecurity contexts; our expert-based questionnaire demonstrated strong agreement, achieving a Kendall-W score of 0.7179. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","","","","","","IEEE Trans.

Therefore, we propose an ontological model to formalize the domain’s concepts, relationships, and properties, while introducing an optimization function for selecting the best public cloud provider based on the proposed features. This comprehensive strategic approach aims to enhance data management practices automation, drive innovation in cloud technologies, and facilitate informed decision-making in multi-cloud environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","52-61","","","1470 LNNS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Semantic representations streamline service discovery and composition, enhancing interoperability. Blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens play pivotal roles in establishing a fully decentralized marketplace characterized by data verification and immutability.

Audit logs contain fine-grained OS-level information, but due to their vast volume and the complex relationships between entities, processing and analyzing them remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce MPKAN, a new method for detecting APT attacks, which enhances the information input of nodes and edges, integrates node-level and edge-level information, and improves graph-level semantics. It uses meta-path random walks to enhance semantic connections between nodes, merges multiple edges in the provenance graph into a single edge while retaining the original edge information and operation sequence relationships, and by associating heterogeneous graph neighbors, utilizing the message passing mechanism to iteratively update states based on neighbor node information, and using a knowledge association network to integrate node-level and edge-level information, we can effectively capture local and global structural information in the graph. MPKAN's evaluations on the ATLAS and Darpa datasets demonstrate its excellent performance in complex attack scenarios, achieving an average accuracy of 0.9899 and an F1 score of 0.9853, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","2605-2610","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 2025 Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

System observability for conducting effective and comprehensive fault injection experiments must be enhanced, particularly due to the complex and distributed architectures of cloud-edge environments, where a single failure can trigger cascading effects, creating a dynamic and expanding fault blast radius. Additionally, accurate fault diagnosis becomes even more challenging when multiple teams simultaneously inject faults into interdependent components, highlighting the need for collaborative fault injection rather than confounding concurrent activities. This work addresses these challenges by proposing a collaborative fault injection framework powered by knowledge graph technologies. The framework enhances collaboration by enabling teams to seamlessly synchronize fault injection experiments within a shared environment. By extracting dynamic fault blast radius information from the proposed fault observation knowledge graph after fault injection, the system observability is improved and more efficient fault injection experiments are ensured. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we use an evolutionary game theory model to analyze the dynamic interactions among stakeholders. Utilizing a simulated OpenStack platform as our testbed, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional fault injection techniques, achieving a remarkable 42.76% reduction in the average time required to observe the complete fault blast radius. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","","","","","","Int.

Despite the potential, the complex model architectures and dynamic network conditions will introduce numerous bubbles (i.e., idle waiting time) in pipeline execution, resulting in inefficient resource utilization and degraded QoS. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named COACH, designed for near bubble-free pipeline collaborative inference, thereby achieving low inference latency and high system throughput. Initially, COACH employs an offline component that utilizes an efficient recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm to optimize both model partitioning and transmission quantization, aiming to minimize the occurrence of pipeline bubbles. Subsequently, the online component in COACH employs an adaptive quantization adjustment and a context-aware caching strategy to further stabilize pipeline execution. Specifically, COACH analyzes the correlation between intermediate data and label semantic centers in the cache, along with its influence on the quantization adjustment, thereby effectively accommodating network fluctuations. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of COACH in reducing inference latency and enhancing system throughput. Notably, while maintaining comparable accuracy, COACH achieves up to 1.7× faster inference and 2.1× higher system throughput than baselines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc IEEE INFOCOM","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 2025 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications, INFOCOM 2025; Conference location: London; CODEN: PINFE</p>","","","Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Semantics; Optimization; Complex networks; Bubble-free; Collaborative inference; Collaborative Inference; End-devices; Inference engines; Model partition; Model Partition; Pipeline execution; Pipeline optimization; Pipelines; Quality of service; Quality-of-service; Quantisation; Quantization adjustment; Quantization Adjustment; System throughput; Throughput","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current manual assessment methods, such as educational equivalency, operate at a slow pace and rely on unreliable methods, which limits their potential for widespread adoption. Study results indicate Word Mover's Distance (WMD) developed within Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers the most effective solution for analyzing the meaning of academic qualifications. When use WMD analysis on course descriptions and learning outcomes, it may get better contextual equivalence assessment methods that fix problems with older assessment methods. The recommended system implements WMD technology for automatic equivalence assessment through cloud infrastructure processing. The recommended system integrates cloud computing benefits and computational capabilities to manage large quantities of information and perform thorough semantic evaluations. Multiple course description datasets from different institutions examine the effectiveness of WMD against known similarity measurements such as cosine and Jaccard similarity. According to the study, WMD is better at finding similar courses because it uses contextual connections between different course sections. Using both developed heatmaps and semantic embeddings together makes it easier to see outcome data because they show the same information in ways that are easy to understand. The worldwide business sector benefits from cloud computing, which delivers adaptive system frameworks together with real-time computing operations throughout expandable resources that users at any location can reach.

To solve this, we propose a hybrid approach that employs a genetic algorithm, leveraging semantically described micro SaaS services using an ontology. Each micro SaaS is stored alongside compatible SaaS offerings with the same functionality within a single cloud, based on the concept of compatibility. While a single micro SaaS may not fulfill all functional requirements in some cases, a composition of multiple SaaS(s), termed virtual SaaS, can meet the customer’s needs.

Today, various methods have been proposed to malware detection in Cloud computing. In this paper, a semantic autonomous intrusion detection system (SAutoIDS) based on the ontology and cellular automata (CLA) and group method of data handling deep neural network (GMDH-DNN) is proposed to malware detection. The Semantic Multi-Level Approach (SMLA) processes of the data and transformed into semantic values based on a semantic level. The ontology method selects optimal features from malware data. Then the semantic data are divided into training and testing samples. Training data are implemented to the GMDH-DNN for creating the model and CLA to optimize the GMDH model. Finally, testing data are entered into the optimized GMDH model and malwares are detected. We have used CICMaldroid2020, malicious, ArvindMahindru66 and Android Applications dataset to evaluate the SAutoIDS. By implementing the SAutoIDS, it was observed that the accuracy improved by 1.1% compared to other methods MAFF, Federation, Machine learning and De-LADY Method. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","","","","","","Int.

Through distributed architecture, the computing power network can cover clouds, edges, and terminals to meet different levels of computing needs. Then, in reality, the network resources are complex, and there are many high-concurrent transmission tasks in the computing network. The OSPF routing algorithm adopted in the traditional network only supports multiple transmission tasks to seize the bandwidth resources of a single link, so it is difficult for users to flexibly choose computing resources according to the task requirements. Therefore, in order to achieve the heterogeneity of network resources, we propose a cross-network fusion scheduling mechanism for high-concurrent transmission tasks in the computing network. By sensing the performance parameters of multi-link heterogeneous networks, we assign a link with relatively abundant bandwidth and relatively short time to complete all transmission tasks to the new task flow for transmission, so as to ensure the bandwidth demand of high concurrent transmission tasks. Finally, the test results show that this method can make full use of network resources, and the throughput of each task flow is improved by more than 100 Mbps, and the transmission time of each task is reduced by more than 5 s. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","1189-1194","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 2025 Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Inf.

In real practice, the sensor network may suffer from communication and/or sensor failures. This might be due to cyber-attacks, faults, or environmental conditions. Distributed estimation resilient to such conditions is the topic of this paper. By representing the sensor network as a graph and exploiting its inherent structural properties, we introduce novel techniques that enhance the robustness of distributed estimators. As compared to the literature, the proposed estimator (i) relaxes the network connectivity of most existing single time-scale estimators and (ii) reduces the communication load of the existing double time-scale estimators by avoiding the inner consensus loop. On the other hand, the sensors might be subject to faults or attacks, resulting in biased measurements. Removing these sensor data may result in observability loss. Therefore, we propose resilient design on the definitions of q-node-connectivity and q-link-connectivity, which capture robust strong-connectivity under link or sensor node failure. By proper design of the sensor network, we prove Schur stability of the proposed distributed estimation protocol under failure of up to q sensors or q communication links. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","3975-3984","","5","12","","IEEE Trans.

To address these, we propose the Internet of Twins, a disaggregated DT deployed in a distributed cloud architecture where interconnections are made using a remote procedure call framework, gRPC. Using this, we develop DT as a platform with knowledge-graph-based orchestration.

We present here the recommendations of a working group composed of experts from both the public and private sectors. Robust data management requires precise ontologies and standardized vocabulary while a centralized database architecture across laboratories facilitates data integration into high-value datasets. Lab automation and opening electronic lab notebooks to data mining push the boundaries of data sharing and data modeling. Important considerations for building robust machine-learning models include transparent and reproducible data processing, choosing the most relevant data representation, defining the right training and test sets, and estimating prediction uncertainty. Beyond data-sharing, cloud-based computing can be harnessed to build and disseminate machine-learning models. Important vectors of acceleration for hit and chemical probe discovery will be (1) the real-time integration of experimental data generation and modeling workflows within design-make-test-analyze (DMTA) cycles openly, and at scale and (2) the adoption of a mindset where data scientists and experimentalists work as a unified team, and where data science is incorporated into the experimental design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","","","1","15","","Nat.

Thus, medical organizations have been widely adopting cloud services, resulting in the effective storage of sensitive data. To prevent privacy and security issues associated with the data, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been a popular choice for encrypting private data. Likewise, the attribute-based access control (ABAC) technique has been widely adopted for controlling data access. Researchers have proposed electronic health record (EHR) systems using ABE techniques like ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), key policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE), and multi authority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE). However, there is a lack of rigorous comparison among the various ABE schemes used in healthcare systems. To better understand the usability of ABE techniques in medical systems, we performed a comprehensive review and evaluation of the three popular ABE techniques by developing EHR systems using knowledge graphs with the same data but different encryption mechanisms. We have used the MIMIC-III dataset with varying record sizes for this study. This paper can help healthcare organizations or researchers using ABE in their systems to comprehend the correct usage scenario and the prospect of ABE deployment in the most recent technological evolution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","","","1","14","","Sci.

Semantic type detection is important for these services that rely on semantic types to interpret data and provide useful functions accordingly. Meanwhile, deep learning (DL) has been introduced for semantic type detection and transforming the field. However, existing DL-based approaches, albeit successfully achieving high F1 scores, are not practical in the real cloud environment because they suffer from issues like low efficiency and high intrusiveness to user data sources. To address these issues, we present Taste, a novel semantic type detection framework with two phases, each associated with a DL-driven detection task. The intuition behind this framework is that metadata (e.g., column name, statistics) contain rich technical and business information, which can be leveraged to detect semantic types effectively while only incurring lightweight impact on user data sources. Thus, we design the detection task in the first phase purely using native metadata from user data sources as input. In contrast, the second phase is optional and only activated when there is a high uncertainty with the first task’s result. It then needs to retrieve both metadata and column content to derive semantic types more reliably. Furthermore, we adopt multi-task learning and develop a novel DL model, called Asymmetric Double-Tower Detection (ADTD), to support the two tasks simultaneously. This design enables caching and reuse of the latent representations from the first task to reduce inference time. In the implementation, we further introduce a pipelined execution mechanism to boost performance for massive user table processing. Evaluation results show that Taste achieves state-of-the-art performance in execution time and F1 score, and is more robust under different data privacy settings, demonstrating its potential for real application in cloud environment. 1 © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:21","2025-11-10 09:29:21","","324-326","","","28","","","","","","","","OpenProceedings.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 2 Journal Abbreviation: Adv.

However, constructing reliable knowledge graphs in decentralized ecosystems, with distributed autonomous actors, poses significant challenges related to asynchronous transmission, out-of-order knowledge-sharing, device heterogeneity, and trust issues. These challenges are also present in resource orchestration within multi-cloud edge ecosystems where multiple stakeholders must collaborate and share information to enable next-gen smart applications. In this paper, we propose a novel system design that utilizes Distributed Ledger Technology to build knowledge graphs. This approach ensures consistent and trustworthy knowledge sharing among orchestrators in a cloud-edge continuum. Our solution accommodates diverse requirements of both cloud and edge servers, allowing clients to construct complete historic graphs or build filtered sub-graphs. We deploy our solution in a multi-cloud edge environment and construct knowledge graphs representing the system state, including clusters, servers, microservices, and various resources.

In recent years, a few secure multi-keyword ranked search schemes over encrypted cloud data have considered the data semantics. However, the search efficiency of these schemes can still be improved. This paper presents an efficient privacy-preserving semantic-aware multi-keyword ranked search scheme (EPSMR) over encrypted cloud data. EPSMR utilizes the LDA topic model to discover hidden semantic information in documents and convert documents into vector representations. vector encryption by using the secure inner product is employed to implement the privacy-preserving semantic relevance score computation between search keywords and documents. To achieve efficient multi-keyword searches, the bisecting k-means algorithm and search tree structure are introduced to design a novel ω-way balanced search tree index which benefits finding search results quickly. to further improve the search efficiency, a filtering-threshold lookup table is presented, which can be used to prune unqualified sub-trees in advance.

However, the industry chain is characterized by a wide range of fields, complex environment, and many factors, which creates a challenge for efficient integration and leveraging of industrial big data. Aiming at the integration of physical space and virtual space of the current industry chain, we propose an industry chain digital twin (DT) system framework for the industrial Internet. In addition, an industry chain information model based on a knowledge graph (KG) is proposed to integrate complex and heterogeneous industry chain data and extract industrial knowledge. First, the ontology of the industry chain is established, and an entity alignment method based on scientific and technological achievements is proposed. Second, the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) based multi-head selection model is proposed for joint entity–relation extraction of industry chain information. Third, a relation completion model based on a relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN) and a graph sample and aggregate network (GraphSAGE) is proposed which considers both semantic information and graph structure information of KG. Experimental results show that the performances of the proposed joint entity–relation extraction model and relation completion model are significantly better than those of the baselines. Finally, an industry chain information model is established based on the data of 18 industry chains in the field of basic machinery, which proves the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:22","2025-11-10 09:29:22","","951-967","","7","25","","Front.

OKG is crucial for innovation management analysis as it provides a clear boundary to understand complex knowledge domain in detail. In the patent analysis field, it facilitates the definition of a well-defined patent portfolio, aiming for accurate and complete patent retrievals and subsequent analyses. In recent decade, the rapid growth of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector has rendered data centers (DCs) indispensable for data processing, storage, and cloud computing, while ensuring security and privacy during DC operations. However, their energy-intensive operations pose challenges to global efforts toward achieving net-zero emissions goals. In response, this research develops a formal OKG refinement process and uses DC net-zero technology OKG as case study for in-depth OKG refinement and application in patent portfolio analysis. The net-zero DC domain covers five sub-technologies. Utilizing the proposed OKG refinement and patent portfolio analysis framework, the 1801 most recent decade’s patents related to relevant “DC net-zero technologies” are retrieved and analyzed. Particularly in this case, DC colocation and server-as-a-service perspectives are the newly discovered sub-domains for OKG refinement.

The module delivers learning materials on Cloud-based Consensus Pathway Analysis in an interactive format that uses appropriate cloud resources for data access and analyses. Pathway analysis is important because it allows us to gain insights into biological mechanisms underlying conditions. But the availability of many pathway analysis methods, the requirement of coding skills, and the focus of current tools on only a few species all make it very difficult for biomedical researchers to self-learn and perform pathway analysis efficiently. Furthermore, there is a lack of tools that allow researchers to compare analysis results obtained from different experiments and different analysis methods to find consensus results. To address these challenges, we have designed a cloud-based, self-learning module that provides consensus results among established, state-of-the-art pathway analysis techniques to provide students and researchers with necessary training and example materials. The training module consists of five Jupyter Notebooks that provide complete tutorials for the following tasks: (i) process expression data, (ii) perform differential analysis, visualize and compare the results obtained from four differential analysis methods (limma, t-test, edgeR, DESeq2), (iii) process three pathway databases (GO, KEGG and Reactome), (iv) perform pathway analysis using eight methods (ORA, CAMERA, KS test, Wilcoxon test, FGSEA, GSA, SAFE and PADOG) and (v) combine results of multiple analyses. We also provide examples, source code, explanations and instructional videos for trainees to complete each Jupyter Notebook. The module supports the analysis for many model (e.g. human, mouse, fruit fly, zebra fish) and non-model species.

The property-specific knowledge graph model is designed to model user–item and item–item bipartite relations. Based on the property-specific knowledge graph model, property-specific user–item relation features can be mined from it. Then the user–item relation features will be integrated into an improved collaborative filtering algorithm based on the local sensitive hash technique for Top-N item recommendation. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method in terms of Top-N recommendation on the MovieLens dataset, and prove it outperforms numbers of state-of-the-art recommendation systems.

However, the obstacles of bioinformatics are compounded by the complexity of data processing and the distinct nature of omics data types, particularly in terms of visualization and statistics. Objectives: We developed a comprehensive and free platform, CFViSA, to facilitate effortless visualization and statistical analysis of omics data by the scientific community. Methods: CFViSA was constructed using the Scala programming language and utilizes the AKKA toolkit for the web server and MySQL for the database server. The visualization and statistical analysis were performed with the R program. Results: CFViSA integrates two omics data analysis pipelines (microbiome and transcriptome analysis) and an extensive array of 79 analysis tools spanning simple sequence processing, visualization, and statistics available for various omics data, including microbiome and transcriptome data. CFViSA starts from an analysis interface, paralleling a demonstration full course to help users understand operating principles and scientifically set the analysis parameters. Once analysis is conducted, users can enter the task history interface for figure adjustments, and then a complete series of results, including statistics, feature tables and figures. All the graphic layouts were printed with necessary statistics and a traceback function recording the options for analysis and visualization; these statistics were excluded from the five competing methods. Conclusion: CFViSA is a user-friendly bioinformatics cloud platform with detailed guidelines for integrating functions in multi-omics analysis with real-time visualization adjustment and complete series of results provision.

Therefore, this article considers applying EI to SAGIN to form the EI-driven SAGIN architecture, which can significantly enhance the communication, computing, sensing and storage capabilities of SAGIN architecture to solve the problem of efficient resource management for resource-constrained users.

Evidently, the volume of relevant monitoring data can be significant, and the ability to collect, analyze, and act on this data in real time is critical for the infrastructure’s efficient use. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that adeptly manages the diverse, dynamic, and voluminous nature of cloud resources and the applications that they support. We use knowledge graphs to represent computing and storage resources and illustrate the relationships between them and the applications that utilize them. We then train GraphSAGE to acquire vector-based representations of the infrastructures’ properties, while preserving the structural properties of the graph. These are efficiently provided as input to two unsupervised machine learning algorithms, namely CBLOF and Isolation Forest, for the detection of storage and computing overusage events, where CBLOF demonstrates better performance across all our evaluation metrics. Following the detection of such events, we have also developed appropriate re-optimization mechanisms that ensure the performance of the served applications. Evaluated in a simulated environment, our methods demonstrate a significant advancement in anomaly detection and infrastructure optimization. The results underscore the potential of this closed-loop operation in dynamically adapting to the evolving demands of cloud infrastructures. By integrating data representation and machine learning methods with proactive management strategies, this research contributes substantially to the field of cloud computing, offering a scalable, intelligent solution for modern cloud infrastructures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:22","2025-11-10 09:29:22","","","","1","22","","J.

With the rapid realization of quantum devices, Web 3.0 is being developed in parallel with the deployment of quantum cloud computing and quantum Internet. In this regard, quantum computing first disrupts the original cryptographic systems that protect data security while reshaping modern cryptography with the advantages of quantum computing and communication. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a quantum blockchain-driven Web 3.0 framework that provides information-theoretic security for decentralized data transferring and payment transactions.

Next, we discuss the potential applications and challenges of implementing quantum blockchain in Web 3.0. Finally, we describe a use case for quantum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and propose a quantum deep learning-based optimal auction for NFT trading to maximize the achievable revenue for sufficient liquidity in Web 3.0.

Over the past decade, we have observed dynamically growing interest in Cloud Computing. The benefits of the cloud approach caused the increasing popularity of Cloud-native applications. Cloud-native is an approach to developing and deploying applications according to the concepts of DevOps, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), containers and microservices. The knowledge about Cloud Computing has become extensive and complex. Fortunately, before Cloud-native applications development, there was a great deal of effort to develop tools for effective knowledge representation. Ontologies are a convenient way to show the relations between domain-specific concepts. In this paper, we propose an ontology named CNOnt that describes the state-of-the-art of Cloud-native applications. CNOnt covers aspects from the clusterization perspective. First, this paper presents the engineering perspective of building the CNOnt ontology. Second, we demonstrate a use case of our ontology that proves the correctness of CNOnt development. This ontology is exhausted in CNOnt Broker. It is a system that applies the information in the OWL file into the Kubernetes cluster and in reverse.

Recognizing the importance of fault injection underscores a critical challenge: the need to enhance system observability for conducting effective and comprehensive fault injection experiments. This is particularly crucial due to the complex, distributed architectures of cloud-edge environments, where a single failure can trigger cascading failures, creating a dynamic and expanding fault blast radius. To address these challenges, this work advocates for the adoption of knowledge graph technologies to significantly improve fault knowledge representation, system observability, and minimize resource expenditure on monitoring systems. We introduce the Fault Observation Knowledge Graph (FOKG), comprising three detailed sub-knowledge graphs that describe the nuances of application deployment, delineate known fault chains, and outline the monitoring mechanisms in place. By extracting dynamic fault blast radius information and refining monitoring strategies from FOKG after fault injection, we ensure a more targeted observation and efficient fault injection experiment. Our methodology, validated on a custom-developed OpenStack platform, surpasses traditional fault injection techniques by achieving a remarkable 42.76% reduction in the average time required to observe the complete fault blast radius. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:22","2025-11-10 09:29:22","","30-35","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Connected and automated vehicles enable data-driven innovations throughmodern, upgradeable, flexible, and extensible software architectures, artificial intelligence, and specialized hardware with built-in connectivity. Such vehicles operate in a safety-critical and time-sensitive environment and are subjected to various nonfunctional requirements including quality, reliability, security, and safety. However, testing these requirements poses several challenges and requires large heterogeneous data sets fromreal-world scenarios. While on-road testing is a huge effort in both time and cost, traffic simulations in combination with further simulations allow to prove the technical feasibility and reduce the risks for sophisticated and expensive software developments. Currently, a lot of research is conducted in the domain of automated driving systems, but there is a lack of simulation-based testing approaches that focus on the connectivity dimension and, in particular,mobility services running in the cloud and servingmultiple vehicles at scale. Therefore, we propose amodeling approach to describe scenarios that involve cloud-basedmobility services. More precisely, an ontology along with a corresponding domain-specific language is introduced that allows one to formally represent the domain concepts, their characteristics, and interrelationships throughmodel-based scenario descriptions. Furthermore, we discuss the notation for the language and propose a web-based user interface that abstracts domain complexity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:22","2025-11-10 09:29:22","","","","","2024-September","","","","","","","","Cal-Tek srl","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Nevertheless, semantic interoperability remains a critical challenge in multi-cloud platforms, where diverse cloud services need to communicate and function seamlessly. Current solutions lack a unified semantic-based representation within reference architectures in multi-cloud platforms and mainly focus on the independent interoperability of a service model, i.e., SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. This study addresses the critical issue of semantic interoperability in multi-cloud platforms, where the heterogeneity of proprietary cloud solutions impedes seamless integration and communication. Thus, we proposed a reference architecture utilizing an ontology-based approach to facilitate semantic interoperability across diverse cloud platforms. The reference architecture is based on five semantic interoperability requirements identified in our previous study. This paper presents the design and development of a reference architecture that includes high-level and low-level components supported by a taxonomy of semantic interoperability in multi-cloud platforms. Expected outcomes of this study include a standardized framework using an ontology-based approach for semantic mapping and integration of cloud services, which will significantly enhance interoperability and efficiency in multi-cloud platforms. The significance of this research lies in its potential to advance the state of knowledge and practice in multi-cloud computing, enabling more robust and flexible cloud service ecosystems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:22","2025-11-10 09:29:22","","1967-1975","","6","14","","Int.

A hybrid cloud platform for telerehabilitation medicine is implemented as a component-based collection of services, including a medical information system for rehabilitation, a dialog information and reference system (MedRehabBot), a predictive and analytical system for assessing rehabilitation process effectiveness, and services for optimizing rehabilitation process models. These services operate within an ontology-driven, service-oriented architecture. One of the key advantages of this type of architecture is its support for experimental design systems, where the design process of the target architecture is accompanied by scientific research. This paper examines the overall functional architecture of the platform (and its technical requirements) in the form of three interacting subsystems: medical-rehabilitation, information-analytical, and telerehabilitation. The architectural and technological organization of the platform is developed using a model that implements an advanced concept of an automated scientific research workstation.

Objective: The aim of this study was to monitor and analyze the dissemination of information about pollen symptoms from December 2006 to January 2022. By conducting a comprehensive evaluation of public comments and trends on Twitter, the research sought to provide valuable insights into the impact of pollen on sensitive individuals, ultimately enhancing our understanding of how pollen-related information spreads and its implications for public health awareness. Methods: Using a blend of large language models, dimensionality reduction, unsupervised clustering, and term frequency-inverse document frequency, alongside visual representations such as word clouds and semantic interaction graphs, our study analyzed Twitter data to uncover insights on respiratory allergies. This concise methodology enabled the extraction of significant themes and patterns, offering a deep dive into public knowledge and discussions surrounding respiratory allergies on Twitter. Results: The months between March and August had the highest volume of messages. The percentage of patient tweets appeared to increase notably during the later years, and there was also a potential increase in the prevalence of symptoms, mainly in the morning hours, indicating a potential rise in pollen allergies and related discussions on social media. While pollen allergy is a global issue, specific sociocultural, political, and economic contexts mean that patients experience symptomatology at a localized level, needing appropriate localized responses. Conclusions: The interpretation of tweet information represents a valuable tool to take preventive measures to mitigate the impact of pollen allergy on sensitive patients to achieve equity in living conditions and enhance access to health information and services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","","","","26","","J.

It has constructed numerous domain-specific knowledge graphs related to merchants, companies, accounts, products, and more. AKGP manages trillions of structured knowledge graphs, serving search, recommendation, risk control and other businesses. However, as the demand increasing for various workloads such as graph pattern matching, graph representation learning, and cross-domain knowledge reuse, the existing warehouse systems based on relational DBMS or graph databases are unable to meet the requirements. To address these issues, we propose KGFabric, an industrial-scale knowledge graph management system built on the distributed file system (DFS). KGFabric offers a nearline knowledge storage engine that utilizes a Semantic-enhanced Programmable Graph (SPG) model, which is compatible with the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model. The data is persistently stored in DFS, such as HDFS, which leverages the POSIX file system API, making it suitable for deployment in multi-cloud environment at low cost. KGFabric provides a native graph-based and hybrid storage format that can serve as a shared backend for parallel graph computing systems, significantly accelerating the analysis of multi-workload. Additionally, KGFabric includes a graph fabric framework that minimizes data duplication and guarantees data security. KGFabric is able to manage Peta-scale data and has supported graph fabric and analysis with over 100 billion relations at Ant Group. We conduct experiments on various datasets to evaluate the performance of KGFabric. Compared with popular relational DBMS and graph databases, the storage space for semantic relations is reduced by over 90%. The performance of graph fabric improves by 21X in real-world workloads. In multi-hop semantic graph analysis, KGFabric enhances performance by 100X. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","3841-3854","","","17","","","","","","","","VLDB Endowment","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 12 Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

For SI, ontology is selected as a solution. A hierarchical structure is offered by an ontology that comprises semantic relations between the application and the cloud server (CS). Even though different methods are introduced, ontology centered on semantic relation between the application and CS is not yet attained for achieving accurate interoperability. An ontology-centered SI in CC utilizing a modified Shell Game optimization-centered recurrent neural network (MSGO-RNN) is presented in this work. Here, accessing the data from the data warehouse is initiated that experiences different standardization functions for improving the data’s quality, namely, data extraction, data cleaning, data transformation, data loading, and refreshing. Then, the data are passed via the semantic layer (SL), which offers a constant way of interpreting data. Then, for enhancing the accuracy rate of interoperability along with offering a low computational time, the relevant feature is chosen utilizing genetic crossover mutation-centered improved fertile field (GCM-IFF) optimization. Ontology is created utilizing the Protégé tool centered on the data, and respective manipulation is executed utilizing HermiT ontology web language (OWL) reasoner. Lastly, to attain cloud interoperability, the features are trained and tested by employing the MSGO-RNN. The experimental outcome exhibits that when compared with the top-notch methods, an accuracy of 96.32% is acquired by the framework for choosing the CS, and less time of 22567 ms is acquired by the framework for training. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","","","1","2024","","J.

We explore the transformation of standard management, leveraging technologies like cloud computing, big data, and AI, and discuss the strategies of international standardization bodies like ISO and IEC towards machine-readable standards. The core of our research is the construction and application of a power standard knowledge graph, aimed at enhancing the management of standardized knowledge. This involves stages from data collection, incorporating OCR technology, to data management with an emphasis on data quality and security. A significant contribution of this work is the development of the PLM-based Knowledge Graph Completion Model, particularly focusing on the KG-SBERT model, which integrates semantic and structured features from pre-trained language models and knowledge graphs. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of KG-SBERT over traditional KGE models in knowledge graph completion tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt information in improving model performance. surpassing traditional knowledge graph embedding techniques in link prediction accuracy, attaining an MRR of 47.67, and Hits@5 and Hits@10 scores of 25.15, 81.54, and 93.91, respectively.

Especially in the automotive industry, new terms have emerged in the field of connected vehicles, which are defined multiple times in academia and industry. This is due to the lack of an ontology that establishes the connection between terminologies and a taxonomy that categorizes them clearly. Therefore, this paper closes this gap by providing an overview of paradigms, concepts, and technologies for vehicle communication, as well as potential execution platforms and concepts.Additionally, we propose use cases that deal with the connected vehicle in the commercial city bus sector. The first use case deals with the connectivity of the vehicle and the associated possibility of executing computationally intensive machine learning models in the cloud. The aim of this use case is to reduce the energy impact of air conditioning in the city bus. The second use case focuses on cooperative perception and cloud/edge connectivity to increase the efficiency of city buses in their daily operation in road traffic by implementing dynamic route optimization that can react promptly to events such as accidents.

The expansion of technology and information presents a significant challenge to the discovery of Web APIs from multiple service ecosystems. Various Web API recommendation methods have been proposed for Mashup creation, but most either treat different feature factor interactions equally or solely rely on requirements for API recommendation. These approaches face several challenges such as API compatibility dependencies, ambiguous definition and boundary dilemmas of APIs, and sparse API invocation records. In this work, we propose a Semantic-Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Network(SEHGN) for Mashup creation. To address the above deficiencies, we design a multi-semantic aggregator to capture semantic associations between features to encode multiple node-edge relationships. Then, we introduce a semantic embedding component to generate text embedding vectors for mashups and APIs to learn global and local semantic information about text documents at different levels of abstraction. Finally, we fuse the output vectors to obtain a list of candidate Web APIs. Experiences are performed on real datasets, and statistical results show that SEHGN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of overall and long-tail Web API recommendations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","2836-2849","","5","17","","IEEE Trans.

However, during this transformation, various governmental bodies often face the challenge of ""data silos"" caused by factors such as cross-regional, cross-business, and cross-departmental operations. Without altering the existing information platforms, transparent access technology serves as a key solution for data access within e-governance systems. It enables convenient access to information resources stored in different mediums and formats, facilitating the sharing and consolidation of information and data within and between governmental departments, thereby addressing the issue of ""data silos"" and enhancing the comprehensive service capabilities of e-governance. This paper firstly provides an overview of the concept, levels, characteristics, and application scenarios of transparent access to government big data. Secondly, it conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of transparent access technologies in the context of cloud computing and big data. Lastly, based on the requirements of various transparent access technologies and the application of transparent access to government big data, this paper proposes a visionary framework for transparent access to government big data based on cross-domain semantics and channel coupling. This framework includes modules for cross-domain semantic interoperability, coupling of heterogeneous information channels based on knowledge graph, and tracing of multi-source heterogeneous data, aiming to provide innovative solutions for achieving transparent access to government big data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","715-725","","3","31","","Teh.

Edge computing is a distributed computing technology that expands the existing cloud computing architecture to introduce a new layer, the edge layer, between the cloud layer and the user terminal layer. Edge computing has the advantage of greatly improving the data processing speed and efficiency but, at the same time, is complex, and various new attacks occur frequently. Therefore, for improving the security of edge computing, effective and intelligent security strategies and policies must be established in consideration of a wide range of vulnerabilities. Intelligent security systems, which have recently been studied, provide a way to detect and respond to security threats by integrating the latest technologies, such as machine learning and big data analysis. Intelligent security technology can quickly recognize attack patterns or abnormal behaviors within a large amount of data and continuously respond to new threats through learning. In particular, knowledge-based technologies using ontology or knowledge graph technology play an important role in more deeply understanding the meaning and relationships between of security data and more effectively detecting and responding to complex threats. This study proposed a method for recommending strategies to respond to edge computing security incidents based on the automatic generation and embedding of security knowledge graphs. An EdgeSecurity–BERT model, utilizing the latest security vulnerability data from edge computing, was designed to extract entities and their relational information. Also, a security vulnerability assessment method was proposed to recommend strategies to respond to edge computing security incidents through knowledge graph embedding. In the experiment, the classification accuracy of security news data for common vulnerability and exposure data was approximately 86% on average. In addition, the EdgeSecurityKG applying the security vulnerability similarity improved the Hits@10 performance to identify the correct link, but the MR performance was degraded owing to the increased complexity. In complex areas, such as security, careful evaluation of the model’s performance and data selection are important. The EdgeSecurityKG applying the security vulnerability similarity provides an important advantage in understanding complex security vulnerability relationships. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","","","1","13","","Electronics (Switzerland)","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: J.

Plenty of delay-sensitive tasks are executed in adjacent edge servers (ESs) in IoV, incurring the increasing significance of the distribution of ESs. As a decentralized network, Web 3.0 allows for data and applications to be distributed across multiple nodes, making it more transparent and user-controlled and placing higher demands on security. Specifically, some attackers outside IoV transmit insecure tasks, which may damage the ESs or waste computing resources after being executed in ESs. To achieve the security of Web 3.0, zero-trust security, an enhanced security model, is used, which assumes that all the service requests are not trusted to access the system networks by default unless passing the anomaly detection. Therefore, in this article, a secure ESP method with the non-cooperative game for IoV in cloud-edge computing, named ESPS, is proposed. By incorporating an anomaly detection mechanism of tasks, ESPS enhances the security of ESP. Eventually, the experiments on the distribution of Telecom base stations in Shanghai, China show the effectiveness of ESPS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","4020-4031","","5","11","","IEEE Trans.

Ontologies use semantic assessment to portray data inside an environment with interconnection relationships between heterogeneous sets. In cloud computing, asset management includes checking, apportioning, and provisioning. Servers, memory, limit, arrange, central processor, application servers, and modernized systems, in addition, known as virtual machines, are representations of cloud resources. These machines are the handling units of the cloud. a framework that uses ontologies to present the result of extracting types of data from unstructured or semi-structured characteristic dialect content using a component guided by ontologies. An asset assignment is the process of delegating and managing resources to support an organization’s primary planning goals. Resource task is the strategy for perceiving and giving out resources for a specific period to various activities. These exercises, such as administration, back, operation, and so on, can be extended or non-project work. Quality, Kindness, Protest, and Modality are the four categories. Two capabilities shape the foundation of the fourfold design. The essential refinement is between non-significant substances like modes and characteristics and impressive substances like items and sorts. Ineffective asset management has a coordinated negative impact on execution and fetched as well as a sporadic effect on framework functionality. It can also become too expensive or ineffective due to ineffective execution. Asset administration may be a crucial task for any cloud framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-10 09:29:23","2025-11-10 09:29:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Further improvements to crop yield prediction results can be achieved by developing accurate and efficient methods. In response to such demands, this paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network architecture, called densely connected SegNet (D-SegNet) and demonstrates its advantages on plant segmentation using a new morning glory plant dataset, and also on a complimentary publicly available dataset to promote research in this direction. The D-SegNet is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. It achieves performance better than the state-of-the-art SegNet algorithm. The evaluated precision, recall and F1-score values are 98.20%, 90.64% and 94.26%, respectively, for the morning glory plant dataset. The intersection over union (IoU) value in the image segmentation tasks is 90.56%. A series of experiments on the morning glory plant dataset as well as on the publicly available dataset were conducted. The results show that the proposed method achieves accurate segmentation results and can be useful for assessing the plant weight during harvesting. In summary, this new plant segmentation network, D-SegNet, could form an important component of future cloud-based machine learning systems to predict crop yield from noisy smartphone images taken in the field. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:24","2025-11-10 09:29:24","","","","","555","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: J.

The embedding semantic association between keywords and documents are not considered. To solve this problem, we propose a novel semantic-aware search scheme based on BCI-tree index over encrypted cloud data. The LDA model is adopted to generate vectors for documents and queried keywords and the vectors contain topic-based semantic information. The homomorphic encryption on vectors is used to perform privacy-preserving semantic relevance score computation between queried keywords and documents. To achieve efficient search processing, a novel binary clustering tree-based index (BCI-tree index) is designed, which is constructed following the divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm. By using the BCI-tree index, a depth-first recursive search algorithm is proposed. In addition, a threshold presetting-based optimization is applied to further accelerate the search speed. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme performs good in the semantic precision of search results and the search time cost. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:24","2025-11-10 09:29:24","","3055-3079","","5","26","","World Wide Web","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: Q.

Such strategy needs to adhere to the principle of knowledge coupling that was advocated by Lawrence Weed, the father of modern problem-oriented medical records, in early 1970s where he defined the way medical information should be described for higher decision making. There has never been a more compelling time to use knowledge coupling related to both medical knowledge and the services build around them. The new digital technologies such as microservices, graph-based databases, Internet of Healthcare Things, and Cloud Computing as well as the non-digital disruptive events such as the pandemic have accelerated the adoption of new notions of service integration and knowledge coupling to provide the long waited solution for interoperability in healthcare as well as higher level of knowledge integration and analytics. The cornerstone of every new change is pointing toward the use of microservices and knowledge graph APIs to be able to thrive and lead in the uncertainty and healthcare change. This research paper uses the notion of mindmap to push conversation and guide scholars in developing effective microservice-based care systems that utilize knowledge graphs and the new care standards including the HL7 FHIR. Central to our mindmap is the GraphQL graph-based technology and the medical diagnosis as a service.

Accurately tracing the source of responsibility, refining and applying the unbalanced data in the highway project archives is of great significance for realizing the intelligent transformation of highway construction project management. This paper firstly sorts out the construction process of highway projects and the main data sources, constructs a data association network between construction entities and construction process, as well as a knowledge map of highway construction data. Then, according to the highway construction stage, an index system based on 12 key data is constructed by using the entropy weight cloud model method, and the importance of the data is evaluated. Thirdly, based on the unbalanced characteristics of highway project data, a method of mining big data in highway project archives using classification evaluation indexes is proposed, and the accuracy of this method is verified by case calculation. Finally, taking the Shizong Qiubei Expressway in China as an example, the intelligent management and control suggestions for key data of transportation projects are proposed. It is found that the key data with special importance rate in highway construction include construction data, supervision data and completion data. Boosting algorithm is more accurate than the traditional SMOTE algorithm for unbalanced data mining, which helps to save the project construction cost and improve the quality of data extraction in the project archives.

Prior approaches to this topic are often specific to a cloud provider or a certain certification catalog. This makes it costly and complex to achieve conformance to multiple certification schemes and covering multi-cloud solutions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to continuous certification which is scheme- and vendor-independent. Leveraging an ontology of cloud resources and their security features, we generalize vendor- and scheme-specific terminology into a new model of so-called semantic evidence. In combination with generalized metrics that we elicited out of requirements from the EUCS and the CCMv4, we present a framework for the collection and assessment of such semantic evidence across multiple cloud providers. This allows to conduct continuous cloud certification while achieving re-usability of metrics and evidences in multiple certification schemes. The performance benchmark of the framework's prototype implementation shows that up to 200,000 evidences can be processed in less than a minute, making it suitable for short time intervals used in continuous certification. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:24","2025-11-10 09:29:24","","24-33","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 3; Conference name: 38th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, SAC 2023; Conference location: Tallinn; Conference sponsors: ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP)</p>","","","Cloud security; Semantics; Cloud securities; cloud security; Cloud services; Ontology's; Distributed database systems; Multi-clouds; Cloud providers; Benchmarking; cloud service certification; Cloud service certification; Degrees of automation; evidence assessment; Evidence assessment; Evidence-based; Security features","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods: Python-based whole genome screening of ERSE was performed using the Amazon Web Services elastic computing system. The Kinome database was used to filter out the kinases from the extracted list of ERSE-related genes. Additionally, network analysis and genome enrichment were achieved using NDEx, the Network and Data Exchange software, and web-based computational tools. To validate the gene expression, quantitative RT-PCR was performed for selected kinases from the list by exposing the HeLa cells to tunicamycin and brefeldin, ER stress inducers, for various time points. Key findings: The overall number of ERSE-associated genes follows a similar pattern in humans, mice, and rats, demonstrating the ERSE's conservation in mammals. A total of 2705 ERSE sequences were discovered in the human genome (GRCh38.p14), from which we identified 36 kinases encoding genes. Gene expression analysis has shown a significant change in the expression of selected genes under ER stress conditions in HeLa cells, supporting our finding. Significance: In this study, we have introduced a rapid method using Amazon cloud-based services for genome-wide screening of ERSE sequences from both positive and negative strands, which covers the entire genome reference sequences. Approximately 10 % of human protein-protein interactomes were found to be associated with ERSE-related genes. Our study also provides a rich resource of human ER stress-response-based protein networks and transcription factor interactions and a reference point for future research aiming at targeted therapeutics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:24","2025-11-10 09:29:24","","","","","317","","Life Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Inc.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: P.

Organizations and individuals that adopt the multi-cloud strategy often use various cloud services and platforms. On top of that, cloud service providers may offer a range of services with unique data formats, structures, and semantics. Hence, semantic interoperability is required to enable applications and services to understand and use data consistently, regardless of the cloud service providers. The main goal of this study is to propose a reference architecture for semantic interoperability in multicloud platforms. Towards achieving the main goal, this paper presents two main contributions. First contribution is an extended cloud computing interoperability taxonomy, with semantic approach as one of the solutions for facilitating semantic cloud interoperability. Two fundamental semantic approaches have been identified, namely semantic technologies and frameworks which will be adopted as the main building blocks. Semantic technologies, such as ontologies, can be used to represent the semantics or meanings of data. Data may be reliably represented across multiple cloud platforms by employing a common ontology. This promotes semantic interoperability by ensuring that data is interpreted and processed uniformly within diverse cloud platforms. On the other hand, a framework offers a standardized and organized way for managing, exchanging, and representing data and services. For the second contribution of this paper, a review of recent (2018-2023) related works has been conducted by investigating the state-of-the-art of semantic interoperability in multi-cloud platforms. As a result, the proposed solution will be implemented in the context of a reference architecture. The reference architecture will act as a blueprint to systematically represent semantic interoperability in multi-cloud platforms using a hybrid approach of role-based and layer-based. Additionally, a semantic layer will be extended to the reference architecture to facilitate semantic interoperability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:24","2025-11-10 09:29:24","","517-527","","12","14","","Intl.

The expansion of technology and information presents a significant challenge to the discovery of Web APIs from multiple service ecosystems. Various Web API recommendation methods have been proposed in mashup creation, but most either assign equal weight to model factorization interactions or solely rely on requirements information for API recommendation. Unfortunately, these methods face several challenges, such as explicit and implicit dependencies among APIs, ambiguous API semantics, and the undervaluation of tail APIs. In this work, we propose a Functional and Structural Fusion Model (FSFM) based on Web API recommendation for Mashup creation. To address the above deficiencies, we first design the structural interaction component to encode the latent structural relationships in the heterogeneous network of Mashups and APIs and capture the topological structure signals between different Mashups and APIs. Then, we introduce the functional semantic component to generate text embedding vectors for Mashups and APIs, enhancing their requirement semantics at multiple levels of abstraction. Finally, we fuse the output vectors to obtain the list of candidate Web APIs. Experiences are performed on real datasets, and statistical results show that FSFM outperforms other state-of-the-art models in both overall and long-tail Web API recommendations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:24","2025-11-10 09:29:24","","91-96","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

The participation of wind power in the emergency reactive power control after grid failure is faced with an urgent need. Aiming at the problem that it is difficult to take into account both the ontology constraint and the active power uncertainty constraint when the doubly-fed induction generator participates in the emergency reactive power control of the power grid, the influence mechanism of different reactive power output modes of the DFIG on the system reactive voltage sensitivity is analyzed, and the emergency reactive power support capacity of the wind power is divided into two levels: the turbine ontology constraint and the active power uncertainty constraint, The cloud model entropy is used to quantitatively describe the probability and uncertainty of wind farm output power, so as to determine the limit of reactive power support capacity of wind farm in real time. When the power grid is subject to voltage disturbance, the maximum reactive voltage support can be implemented to reduce the system transient overvoltage or low voltage without affecting the consumption of clean energy.

As the number of web services on the Internet grows, selecting and recommending them becomes more important. Consequently, in the realm of service computing, how to propose the finest Web services for researchers is now a popular research topic. To determine the proper recommendation, the BI-CSem model was proposed and tested with multiple baseline models using real-world Web Service datasets in this research. Aside from that, thesaurus is built using Web service keywords gathered from Web service repositories such as UDDI,WSDI, and from the World Wide Web Cloud. The extracted terms are then subjected to semantic similarity, which is determined using SemantoSim, Concept similarity, and KL divergence measure, and the terms from the user, such as query, user click, and previous historical data, are pre-processed the terms from the semantic alignment are then classified using XGBoost, while the Web service dataset is classified using XGBoost and GRU. Semantic similarity is determined using just SemantoSim, based on the classification intersection of the top 75 percent words from the extracted terms from the two classifiers and features from the created intermediate term tree generated using STM. Finally, terms are reranked and recommended to the user, and the precision, accuracy, recall, F-measure, and FDR for the Web service recommendation system are calculated, and the Bi-CSem model is found to have an excellent precision percentage of 94.37% and the lowest FDR of 0.06. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:25","2025-11-10 09:29:25","","425-438","","","649 LNNS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The LDA topic model is adopted to generate the topic information-embedded vectors for documents and queried keywords. The homomorphic encryption on vectors is used to perform privacy-preserving semantic relevance score computation between queried keywords and documents.

However, existing statistical-based models face long document feature vectors and can not fully catch the document semantics information. This leads to inefficient and unsatisfactory retrieval results. In this paper, we propose a deep structured semantic model of ranked search over encrypted data (DSRSE) based on a convolutional neural network for the first time. In this scheme, document index vectors and query trapdoors are generated by the convolutional neural network model (CNNM) and encrypted by the secure kNN algorithm. In order to protect documents’ privacy security, we use private cloud servers to train the CNNM distributively. All parameters are updated constantly, and the CNNM is updated regularly. Furthermore, a clustering tree based index structure is proposed. Through inner product of document vectors, semantically similar files are clustered together for building a bottom-up index tree which enhances the retrieval efficiency. Analysis and experiments on real datasets illustrate that our schemes perform well in terms of privacy security, search efficiency and accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-10 09:29:25","2025-11-10 09:29:25","","584-608","","","13656 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

To date, a large number of analytical tools and processes have been developed and constructed to serve untargeted metabolomics research. The different selection of analytical tools and parameter settings lead to varied results of untargeted metabolomics data. Our goal is to establish an easily operated platform and obtain a repeatable analysis result. Methods: We used the R language basic environment to construct the preprocessing system of the original data and the LAMP (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP) architecture to build a cloud mass spectrum data analysis system. Results: An open-source analysis software for untargeted metabolomics data (openNAU) was constructed. It includes the extraction of raw mass data and quality control for the identification of differential metabolic ion peaks. A reference metabolomics database based on public databases was also constructed. Conclusions: A complete analysis system platform for untargeted metabolomics was established.

Developers usually print a set of selected variables in logs to record software system status. Due to the lack of strict logging instructions and domain-specific knowledge, it is challenging for developers to decide which variables to log. Therefore, a technology that enables developers to log high- quality log variables is desirable. There are two reasons that make such a technology feasible. First, there exists semantic relevance between logged variables and other code statements. Second, the structural relationship between variables helps technology learn more information. In this paper, we propose a novel method to recommend variables to log - given a code snippet that needs to be followed by a logging statement, our method will tag every token in this code snippet to indicate whether it should be logged. Our method utilizes a pre-trained model to encode semantic information and a graph neural network to encode graph structure information. Given a code snippet without logging statements, our method first extracts graph structure information by graph neural network, then fuses the graph structure information with semantic information extracted by the pre-trained model to recommend logging variables. We use nine open-source projects' java files to evaluate our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of Hits@1, MRR, and MAP, which indicate that the quality of the first recommended variable and all recommended variables is superior to other baseline models. Moreover this benefits from encoding better semantic information and incorporating graph structure information. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-10 09:29:25","2025-11-10 09:29:25","","4045-4057","","4","19","","IEEE Trans.

Category 1 emergency services (Ambulance, Fire and Rescue, and Police) can benefit from access to (near) real-time traffic- and weather data to coordinate multiple services, such as reassessing a route on the transport network affected by flooding or road incidents. However, there is a tendency not to utilise available smart city data sources, due to the heterogeneous data landscape, lack of real-time information, and communication inefficiencies. Using a systems engineering approach, we identify the current challenges faced by stakeholders involved in incident response and formulate future requirements for an improved system. Based on these initial findings, we develop a use case using Microsoft Azure cloud computing technology for analytical functionalities that can better support stakeholders in their response to an incident. Our prototype allows stakeholders to view available resources, send automatic updates and integrate location-based real-time weather and traffic data.

Despite these advantages, these environments present many challenges, including service management and interoperability issues. Due to the diversity of cloud service providers, their heterogeneity and the exponential growth of offered services, user requirements cannot be adequately met. These problems, if not addressed effectively, can have a negative impact on the cloud environment as well as on the user experience. Thus, to answer the service management problem in multi-cloud environments, we propose in this paper a threefold contribution (i) a noval cloud federation architecture, (ii) a suitable service management system and (iii) a service publication algorithm in order to manage, store and retrieve efficiently cloud services within the federation. Our solution consists in combining several concepts including trust, clustering and , ontologies. Our aim is to automate the management process, maximise the profit and ensure a better user experience.

The knowledge base, research hotspots, and domain evolution trends in the intersection of big data and the construction industry are analyzed quantitatively and aided by qualitative analysis through visualization, respectively. The results show that Chinese and American scholars have published more relevant papers in international journals, and some well-known universities in both countries constitute the main group of research institutions. The research hotspots are BIM, data mining, building energy saving, smart cities, and disaster prevention and damage prevention. In the future, the research on the integration and application of the construction industry with emerging technologies, such as big data, BIM, and cloud computing will be connected more closely.

It is a challenge to design efficient semantic-aware ranked search (SRSE) schemes with privacy preservation. In this paper, two privacy-preserving SRSE schemes are developed for the cloud environments. The first scheme is the accuracy-first search scheme. In this scheme, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model is adopted to generate the topic-based semantic information-embedded vectors for documents and queried keywords, which supports semantic-aware relevance measurement. The bisecting k-means clustering algorithm is used to build an accuracy-first filtering tree index (AFF-tree), and the AFF-tree-based search algorithm is proposed to achieve the accuracy-first ranked search. The second scheme is the efficiency-first search scheme. It performs a structure optimization on the AFF-tree, and a newly efficiency-first filtering tree index (EFF-tree) is designed. By using the EFF-tree, an anchor node-based search algorithm is designed to achieve the efficiency-first ranked search at the expense of a little decrease in search result precision. The secure inner product is used to perform privacy-preserving semantic-aware relevance measurement between documents and queried keywords in both schemes. To analyze the security of the proposed schemes, the game stimulation-based proof is presented.

Despite the benefits, the cloud is still facing security challenges thereby calling for cyber threat intelligence capable of identifying threats and providing possible solutions. However, dependence on traditional security mechanisms and approaches for security solutions within cloud environments presents challenges. This calls for cloud-native solutions which leverages cloud features for design and development of solutions for data and applications hosted and running within the cloud. Past studies have suggested the adoption of semantic technologies for cloud-based security mechanisms. However, the semantic processing of data faces challenges of data interconnectedness due to aggregation of data from diverse heterogenous sources. Hence, this study proposes a cloud-native architecture capable of connecting security-related data from different sources in the cloud to enhance cyber threat intelligence.

Particularly, incident management has become critical for developing and operating large-scale services. Prior work on incident management has heavily focused on the challenges with incident triaging and de-duplication. In this work, we address the fundamental problem of structured knowledge extraction from service incidents. We have built SoftNER, a framework for mining Knowledge Graphs from incident reports. First, we build a novel multi-task learning based BiLSTM-CRF model which leverages not just the semantic context but also the data-types for extracting factual information in the form of named entities. Next, we present an approach to mine relations between the named entities for automatically constructing knowledge graphs. We have deployed SoftNER at Microsoft, a major cloud service provider and have evaluated it on more than 2 months of cloud incidents. We show that SoftNER’s unsupervised pipeline learns the software entity types from unstructured incident data with high precision of 0.96 (at rank 50) and 0.77 (at rank 100). We also evaluate and show that SoftNER’s unsupervised pipeline accurately labels data with a precision of 0.94. Further, our multi-task learning based deep learning model also outperforms the state-of-the-art NER models with an average F1 of 0.96. Lastly, using the knowledge extracted by SoftNER, we are able to build accurate models for tasks such as incident triaging and recommending entities based on their relevance to incident titles. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-10 09:29:25","2025-11-10 09:29:25","","","","4","27","","Empir Software Eng","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: M.

Semantic web is usually new revolution inside the web science, which usually works upon base of ontologies. Ontologies are receiving great attention in the domain of computing and hence in the domain of security. This review paper examines different proposed “ontology centered techniques” and also provides a comprehensive analysis on these tactics. This research paper gives critical analysis of different models presented by different authors and researchers for ensuring security of a cloud based environment. This analysis helps different vendors of cloud technology to adapt one or all of these models to practically implement in their cloud machines whether they are offering IaaS, PaaS or SaaS.

The classification outcomes through SMOreg are capable and demonstrate a general accuracy of around 98.71% in identifying optimum cloud services through the identified parameters.

High-quality structured legal facts, obtained by extracting information from unstructured legal texts, are the foundation for the construction of smart courts. Based on the strong normative characteristics of Chinese legal text content and structure composition and the strong text feature learning ability of deep learning, this paper proposes an ontology-based and deep learning-driven method for extracting legal facts from Chinese legal texts. The proposed method utilizes rules and patterns generated in the process of knowledge modeling to extract simple entities, and then extracts complex entities hidden in legal text details with deep learning methods. Finally, the extracted entities are mapped into structured legal facts with clear logical relationships by the Chinese Legal Text Ontology. In the information extraction test of judicial datasets composed of Chinese legal texts on theft, the proposed method effectively extracts up to 38 categories of legal facts from legal texts and the number of categories extracted increases significantly. Among them, the rule-based extractor obtains an F1-score of 99.70%, and the deep learning-driven extractor obtains an F1-score of 91.43%.

The robustness and accuracy of the perception determine the performance of the whole system. Compared with the camera, lidar can generate point cloud data which can provide accurate 3D information better. At present, more researches focus on environmental perception through point cloud. However, the point cloud has the characteristics of sparsity, unordered and non-uniform distribution, its processing method is also different from the general image-based method. In this paper, we proposed a method of semantic segmentation of point cloud which is realized by convolutional neural network. Through spherical mapping, the scattered point cloud is transformed into 2D spherical map with dense and uniform distribution, which is convenient for the processing of the network. To reduce the loss of point information, the spatial position, reflection intensity information and angle value of point are preserved during spherical mapping. Our work includes a lightweight convolutional neural network that fuses point cloud and image information. In addition, a spatial module is added to supplement the loss of spatial information and improve the performance of segmentation.

It has created a requirement to simplify the process of configuring cloud and re-configuring it when required, it also involves tasks like auto scaling of infrastructure, elastic computing and maintaining the health of the servers. The proposed method introduces a smart cloud management using knowledge base, which models the resources of cloud; it handles service level agreement and its evaluations. The proposed knowledge base supports representational state transfer (REST/RESTful) services to store and manipulate different cloud aspects like type of application, business configuration, and metrics value and its type; it also implements the strategy for efficient resource management for smart clouds. The proposed architecture consists of smart cloud engine (which provides autonomous services, which help to exploit cloud resources for service optimization and to perform service automation), knowledge base (KB) (provide a cloud ontology which will help in the management of resources and provides intelligence to the smart cloud), server and cloud enrolment, designated monitoring tool and moderator. The resulted module is easy to integrate with any of the existing cloud management tool or orchestrator.

In this paper, we propose two secure and semantic retrieval schemes based on BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) named SSRB-1, SSRB-2. By training the documents with BERT, the keyword vector is generated to contain more semantic information of the documents, which improves the accuracy of retrieval and makes the retrieval result more consistent with the user’s intention.

The variety of these techniques is due to the lack of Cloud services description standardization. To deal with such issues and due to the vast search space, we propose in this paper a Cloud services description ontology, “CSDO,” that assists the Cloud service publication, discovery, and selection processes.

This knowledge representation should be flexible and adaptable so that it fits across various manufacturing domains, but, at the same time, should also be specific and exhaustive. We identify three core capabilities that such a platform has to support, i.e., the product, the process and the production.

The aim of this paper is to present a solution on dynamic resource allocation for efficient cloud scalability. This is made possible by using machine learning algorithms as well as user feedback, in order to generate an adequate resource forecasting model. The efficiency of the tool is evaluated by repeatedly executing extensive analysis of various datasets provided by the end users, exploiting the cloud computing paradigm for their analytic purposes.

However, with some drawbacks that are impeding its adoption, security is so far the most alarming concern for companies or organizations. Access control policies, for example, are the most challenging issue that has been tackled these last years; to ensure that the right user is accessing the right resources in such a distributed, virtual and scalable environment handled by a third party, to manage an access request to a shared resource from heterogeneous entities following different policies. In this study, the authors aim to overcome this issue by implementing an access control architecture enabling access to the shared data for collaborating organizations. They propose a model supplied with an ontology database describing the whole environment to control access to a publish/subscribe messaging protocol; which capitalizes on the advantages provided by innovative techniques such as Semantic Web technologies and the publish/subscribe protocol. Semantic Web technologies provide dynamism and scalability for this model thanks to its SWRL inference engine while the publish/subscribe protocol, in this case, MQTT, which is a light-coupling protocol simplifies the traffic between the different actors involved. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-10 09:29:26","2025-11-10 09:29:26","","955-967","","10","18","","J.

The web services discovery and execution processes in the mobile environment are considered a very difficult challenge. Moreover, these processes may degrade network performance due to the mobile environment. To overcome these issues, we present a new approach for better discovery, selection, execution, and negotiation of OWL-S services by utilizing a multi-agent system in mobile cloud computing. By using the Multi-Agent System (mobile agent and fixed agent), these processes are made with the minimum utilization of resources because the mobile agents migrate to targeted services and interact locally with them. Moreover, the use of mobile agent overcomes the problems related to the mobile environment and wireless devices. Besides, it automatizes the discovery, selection, execution, and negotiation of OWL-S services. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Moreover, we conclude that the mobile agent is a good solution to eliminate the problem of wireless devices and the mobile environment, and reduces the execution time of service discovery and invocation. Also, the finding indicates that cloud computing is a good solution to eliminate the problem of storage and execution in mobile devices. Besides, context-aware provides a more accurate service selection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-10 09:29:26","2025-11-10 09:29:26","","173-187","","","60","","Int. J.

The cloud computing built by the container in the high performance computing (HPC) center can provide high-quality services to users at the edge. Singularity Definition File and Dockerfile (we refer to such files as recipes) have attracted wide attention due to their encapsulation of the application running environment in a container. However, creating a recipe requires extensive domain knowledge, which is error-prone and time-consuming. Accordingly, more than 34% of Dockerfiles in Github cannot successfully build container images. The crucial points about recipe creation include selecting the entities (base images and packages) and determining their relationships (correct installation order for transitive dependencies). Since the relationships between entities can be expressed accurately and efficiently by the knowledge graph, we introduce knowledge graph to generate high-quality recipes automatically. This paper proposes an automatic recipe generation system named Burner, enabling users with no professional computer background to generate the recipes. We first develop a toolset including a recipe parser and an entity-relationship miner. Our two-phase recipe parsing method can perform abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing more deeply on the recipe file to achieve entity extraction; the parsing success rate (PSR) of the two-phase parsing method is 10.1% higher than the one-phase parsing. Then, we build a knowledge base containing 2,832 entities and 62,614 entity relationships, meeting the needs of typical HPC applications. In the test of image build, the singularity image build success rate reaches 80%. Compared with the ItemCF recommendation method, our recommendation method TB-TFIDF achieves a performance improvement by up to 50.86%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-10 09:29:26","2025-11-10 09:29:26","","","","","2022","","Wireless Commun.

However, current approaches remain inappropriate for cloud computing since: 1) they lack in a way or another semantic or business aspect, 2) they cannot fully cope with non-functional properties, 3) they are unable to cover all kinds of services (such as SaaS, PaaS, IaaS). Despite the existence of several attempts which have tried to extent existing studies, the problem remains open. In this paper, we propose Cloud-WSDL, a new description model aligned with WSDL language, the most popular language, to make it more suitable for describing cloud services. The idea is to enhance WSDL description with new functional, non-functional and cloud features so to cope with many aspects (technical, operational, business, semantic and contextual). The proposed extension ensures a high interoperability between services belonging to multiple heterogeneous clouds, and supports all the kinds of cloud services (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS).

The extension process begins by transforming WSDL metamodel into Cloud-WSDL metamodel, thus we obtain a syntactic Cloud-WSDL extension.

Cloud computing technologies represent a viable solution for these requirements. To ensure that data can be exchanged and shared efficiently, as well as the full achievement of the cloud computing benefits to support the advanced analytic and mining required in smart grids, applications can be empowered with semantic information integration. This article adopts the semantic web into a cloud-based platform to analyze power distribution grids data and apply a service restoration application to re-energize loads after an electrical fault. The exemplary implementation of the demo is powered by FIWARE, which is based on open-source and customizable building blocks for future internet applications and services, and the SARGON ontology for the energy domain. The tests are deployed by integrating the semantic information, based on the IEC 61850 data model, in the cloud-based service restoration application and interfacing the field devices of the distribution grids. The platform performances, measured as network latency and computation time, ensure the feasibility of the proposed solution, constituting a reference for the next deployments of smart energy platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-10 09:29:26","2025-11-10 09:29:26","","1554-1563","","2","58","","IEEE Trans Ind Appl","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: A.

This results in severe performance degradation in the execution of RDF queries. As every RDF query essentially traverses a graph to find the output of the query, an efficient path traversal reduces the execution time of RDF queries. Hence, query path optimization is required to reduce the execution time as well as the cost of a query. Query path optimization is an NP-hard problem that cannot be solved in polynomial time. Genetic algorithms have proven to be very useful in optimization problems. The authors propose a hybrid genetic algorithm for query path optimization. The proposed algorithm selects an initial population using iterative improvement, thus reducing the initial solution space for the genetic algorithm. The proposed algorithm makes significant improvements in the overall performance. They show that the overall number of joins for complex queries is reduced considerably, resulting in reduced cost. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-11-10 09:29:26","2025-11-10 09:29:26","","","","1","12","","Int.

Considering the information overload problem arising from the task of selecting web services, a recommendation system is by far the most effective solution for performing such selections. However, users calling a limited number of services will cause severe data sparseness and a weak correlation with services. In addition, fully mining the semantic features and knowledge features of the text description is also a major problem that needs to be solved urgently. This paper proposes a deep knowledge-aware approach which introduces knowledge graph and knowledge representation into web service recommendation for the first time. We solve the data sparse problem and optimize the user’s feature representation. In this approach, an attention module is introduced to model the impact of tags for the candidate services on different words of user queries, and a deep neural network is used to model the high-level features of user-service invocation behaviors.

On the other hand, ample research projects and studies have been published that demonstrate the great capabilities of web-geographic information systems (web-GIS) for the dissemination and online representation of cultural heritage data. However, cultural heritage data and the associated metadata produced by many cultural heritage institutions are hetero-geneous. To make this heterogeneous data more interoperable and structured, an ever-growing number of cultural heritage institutions are adopting linked data principles. Although the cultural heritage domain has already started implementing linked open data concepts to the cultural heritage data, there are not many research articles that present an easy-to-implement, free, and open-source-based web-GIS architecture that integrates 3D digital cultural heritage models with cloud computing and linked open data. Furthermore, the integration of web-GIS technologies with 3D web-based visualisation and linked open data may offer new dimensions of interaction and exploration of digital cultural heritage. To demonstrate the high potential of integration of these technol-ogies, this study presents a novel cloud architecture that attempts to enhance digital cultural heritage exploration by integrating 3D digital cultural heritage models with linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms using web-GIS technologies. More specifically, a digital interactive map, 3D digital cultural heritage models, and linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms were integrated into a cloud-based web-GIS architecture. Thus, the users of the architecture can easily interact with the digital map, visualise 3D digital cultural heritage models, and ex-plore linked open data from GeoNames and DBpedia platforms, which offer additional information and context related to the selected cultural heritage site as well as external web resources. The architecture was validated by applying it to specific case studies of Australian cultural heritage and seeking expert feedback on the system, its benefits, and scope for improvement in the near future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","","","10","10","","ISPRS Int.

However, manual encoding of clinical data into machine-readable forms is laborious and subject to observer bias. Natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records has great potential to enhance reproducibility at scale but suffers from idiosyncrasies in physician notes and other medical records. We developed methods to optimize NLP outputs for automated diagnosis. We filtered NLP-extracted Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to more closely resemble manually extracted terms and identified filter parameters across a three-dimensional space for optimal gene prioritization. We then developed a tiered pipeline that reduces manual effort by prioritizing smaller subsets of genes to consider for genetic diagnosis. Our filtering pipeline enabled NLP-based extraction of HPO terms to serve as a sufficient replacement for manual extraction in 92% of prospectively evaluated cases. In 75% of cases, the correct causal gene was ranked higher with our applied filters than without any filters. We describe a framework that can maximize the utility of NLP-based phenotype extraction for gene prioritization and diagnosis.

Cloud computing services include those such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Data as a Service (DaaS). In this context, interoperability enables a service to communicate with another service transparently. Among the solutions proposed in the literature, a middleware can be used to intermediate such communication and to mitigate the lack of interoperability in cloud computing. For instance, the middleware MIDAS (Middleware for DaaS and SaaS) provides transparent interoperability between SaaS and DaaS. Although MIDAS current version promotes syntactic interoperability, semantic interoperability is only superficially addressed. In collaboration with this project, we develop an OWL-based ontology to formally represent the communication between SaaS and DaaS, and discuss its strengths in providing semantic interoperability on MIDAS. We conduct a set of experiments to validate our ontology. We evaluate intrinsic (consistency, correctness, acceptance) and extrinsic (integration between ontology and MIDAS) issues. Results provide evidence that a semantic MIDAS interoperability can be enhanced by our ontology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

To alleviate this care burden, interventions have been proposed that use computer- or web-based applications. For example, an automatic diagnosis of the condition can improve the well-being of both the person with dementia and the caregiver. Other interventions support the individual with dementia in living independently. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop an ontology-based care knowledge management system for people with dementia that will provide caregivers with a care guide suited to the environment and to the individual patient's symptoms. This should also enable knowledge sharing among caregivers. Methods: To build the care knowledge model, we reviewed existing ontologies that contain concepts and knowledge descriptions relating to the care of those with dementia, and we considered dementia care manuals. The basic concepts of the care ontology were confirmed by experts in Korea. To infer the different care methods required for the individual dementia patient, the reasoning rules as defined in Semantic Web Rule Languages and Prolog were utilized. The accuracy of the care knowledge in the ontological model and the usability of the proposed system were evaluated by using the Pellet reasoner and OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!, and a survey and interviews were conducted with caregivers working in care centers in Korea. Results: The care knowledge model contains six top-level concepts: care knowledge, task, assessment, person, environment, and medical knowledge. Based on this ontological model of dementia care, caregivers at a dementia care facility in Korea were able to access the care knowledge easily through a graphical user interface. The evaluation by the care experts showed that the system contained accurate care knowledge and a level of assessment comparable to normal assessment tools. Conclusions: In this study, we developed a care knowledge system that can provide caregivers with care guides suited to individuals with dementia. We anticipate that the system could reduce the workload of caregivers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","","","6","23","","J. Med.

Aiming at the defects of traditional models, a knowledge graph construction model, TransCD, based on cloud model for multi-semantic relationship is proposed to adapt to the construction of domain knowledge graph in power industry. By dividing the relationship into multiple semantics, the Gaussian mixture model of the relationship is constructed; The corresponding cloud model is constructed to obtain the linguistic value and certainty that can best express the relationship; The determinacy is taken as the weight and the weighted Euclidean distance is taken as the new score function. At the same time, combined with the TransD method, the space projection model of entities and relations is established through dynamic mapping matrix, which integrates the advantages of the two models and increases the ability of the model to deal with multiple semantic relations.

The existing metric systems are inadequate for providing a high-fidelity picture of what is going on in the complex cloud and do not facilitate all the assessments needed by businesses. Therefore, we have proposed a novel model for cloud service measurement resulting in implementation of an ontology of cloud computing metrics (“web of metrics”). It provides an armada of measures, including the existing metrics and those which are novel in the cloud service analytics literature. Its novelty partially stems from the fields such as business management, and also emerges as a result of recognizing service client, service provider and service regulator analytics requirements. Thirty-five metric attributes for each of the several hundred metrics have been distinguished. The ontology and the measurements can be made consumable for businesses through Business Intelligence and data science software, and customized dashboards can be produced for case, as the metric ontology is multi-faceted and is customised given the use-case at hand in order to gain business advantage.

MCC faces several security threats in both the Cloud and Mobile environments. Among several threats, malicious apps are the most threatening ones, because they can perform various malicious activities in both environments. The traditional malware detection methods may not detect new types of malware or rapidly changing malware behavior. So, there is a need to develop an accurate model for detecting malicious apps in the MCC environment. Scalability and Knowledge Reusability are challenging issues in existing detection methods. To overcome these issues, the proposed model uses an effective Ontology-based intelligent model based on app permissions to detect malware apps. This model extracts the relationship between the static features from the apps and builds an Apps Feature Ontology (AFO). A concept vector set for apps is created using the items obtained from the AFO. The most discriminant features are selected using optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization, Social Spider Algorithm (SSA), and Gravitational Search Algorithm to reduce the dimension of the concept vector set. Various classifiers are applied to the reduced set. The efficiency of the proposed approach was evaluated on datasets obtained from the AndroZoo repository and VirusShare. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model can correctly detect malware using the Random Forest (RF) classifier with SSA and achieve higher detection accuracy with the lesser fall-out and less detection speed than existing Android malware detection techniques. Specifically, RF with SSA obtained higher accuracy, F1-score, and reduction in the fall-out of 94.11%, 93%, and 3%, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","","","","58","","J.

So, vendor lock-in problem appeared. One solution to this problem is to use generic APIs with specific adapters. However, any update in a PaaS specific-API makes its corresponding adapter is unusable which causes, what we call, API synchronization problem. Therefore, STAGER (SemanTic-based GenERation of Generic-API Adapters) framework is proposed. STAGER framework provides a semi-automatic adapter generation process, which generates specific adapters of generic APIs for PaaS services (e.g., blob storage and datastore services) for target PaaS platforms. The adapter generation process is based on semantic annotations of the generic APIs and their corresponding PaaS specific-APIs. In order to evaluate STAGER framework, two generic APIs for blob storage and NoSQL datastore services have been proposed. STAGER framework is used to generate the adapters of these generic APIs for two PaaS platforms: Google App Engine (GAE) and Windows Azure. Although there is some overhead for semantically annotating the PaaS APIs, the evaluation results prove the feasibility of STAGER framework and promote the usage of the generated adapters for implementing portable cloud applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","903-914","","","14","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 3 Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Trans.

In some circumstances, the keywords that the user searches on are only semantically related to the data rather than via an exact or fuzzy match. Hence, semantic-based keyword search over encrypted cloud data becomes of paramount importance. However, existing schemes usually depend upon a global dictionary, which not only affects the accuracy of search results but also causes inefficiency in data updating. Additionally, although compound keyword search is common in practice, the existing approaches only process them as single words, which split the original semantics and achieve low accuracy. To address these limitations, we initially propose a compound concept semantic similarity (CCSS) calculation method to measure the semantic similarity between compound concepts. Next, by integrating CCSS with Locality-Sensitive Hashing function and the secure $k$k-Nearest Neighbor scheme, a semantic-based compound keyword search (SCKS) scheme is proposed. SCKS achieves not only semantic-based search but also multi-keyword search and ranked keyword search. Additionally, SCKS also eliminates the predefined global library and can efficiently support data update. The experimental results on real-world dataset indicate that SCKS introduces low overhead on computation and the search accuracy outperforms the existing schemes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","850-863","","","14","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 3 Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Trans.

To understand the research context, hot spots, and future development trend of global omni-channel retailing in the past decade and provide a reference for relevant research, this paper collects relevant articles in the WOS database from 2011 to 2020, uses the co-word analysis method to make statistics and analysis on keywords, and uses Bicomb, Spss and Excel software to conduct cluster analysis and strategic coordinate analysis on omni-channel retailing research. The results show that the research on omni-channel retailing logistics and supply chain, the research on omni-channel integration and management, and the research on omni-channel digital marketing and consumer behavior are the three hot areas of omni-channel retailing research. In the future, the mixed methods combining quantitative researches (such as machine learning, artificial neural network, and quantitative model) with qualitative research (such as case research and interviews) can be used from a mixed perspective of consumers and retailers to conduct in-depth research on the operation mechanism and the decision-making mechanism of omni-channel retailing and the interdisciplinary research combining omni-channel and organizational management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","","","","1861","","","","","","","","IOP Publishing Ltd","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 1 Journal Abbreviation: J.

However, the therapeutic mechanism of the effect of HSBDF on COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: The components and action targets of HSBDF were searched in the TCMSP, YaTCM, PubChem, and TargetNet databases. Disease targets related to ACE2 were screened in single-cell sequence data of colon epithelial cells from other reports. The therapeutic targets of HSBDF for COVID-19 were obtained by integrated analysis, and the protein-protein interaction was analyzed using the STRING database. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) processes were analyzed using the OmicsBean and Metascape databases. The communication between networks [component-target (C-T) network, component-target-pathway (C-T-P) network, herb-target (H-T) network, target-pathway (T-P) network, and meridian-tropism (M-T) network] was constructed by Cytoscape software. The Cloud computing molecular docking platform was used to verify the molecular docking. RESULTS: The obtained 223 active ingredients and 358 targets of HSBDF. The 5,555 COVID-19 disease targets related to ACE2 were extracted, and 84 compound-disease common targets were found, of which the principal targets included ACE, ESR1, ADRA1A, and HDAC1. A total of 3,946 items were seized by GO enrichment analysis, mainly related to metabolism, protein binding, cellular response to the stimulus, and receptor activity. The enriched KEGG pathways screened 46 signaling pathways, including the renin-angiotensin system, the renin secretion, NF-kappa B pathway, the arachidonic acid metabolism, and the AMPK signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the bioactive components of HSBDF have an excellent binding ability with main proteins related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: HSBDF might act on SARS-CoV-2 through multiple components, targets, and pathways. Here we reveal preliminary results of the mechanism of action of HSBDF on SARS-CoV-2, providing a theoretical basis for future clinical applications.

In the same time, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a recent paradigm shift that pushes the main focal point of mobile systems from centralized Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) towards the network edge. Network softwarization enables the operation of new computational elements such as base stations and access points at the MEC, whereas edge computing, network control and storage promise to enable computation-intensive and latency-critical applications for resource constrained mobile devices. In this paper, we employ a novel disaggregated 5G architecture and apply a semantic-based coordination approach from the network edge. We consider semantics as the key enabling principle for the implementation of spectrum coordination schemes addressing the coexistence of heterogeneous technologies at the edge of 5G HetUDN wireless networks. A Semantic-based Framework for dynamic Spectrum Coordination (SFSC) deployed according to the MEC approach is proposed dealing with agile complex system resource management.

Developing the digital skills of the municipalities’ workforce is crucial for all occupational profiles and specifically for those that are actively involved in the development and operation of digital services for a smart city. In this context, the current paper presents a semantically enhanced cloud-based IT approach which integrates learning pathways with competence management of personnel working as management and technical employees in a smart city municipality. The proposed approach combines a rule-based expert system with a semantically rich infrastructure in order to map skill gap diagnosis to required learning objects and, thus, to contribute in developing appropriate competences of smart city professionals. The semantic infrastructure of the learning platform consists of an ontology which encapsulates the appropriate knowledge and a rule-base for modeling the steps of an employee training process. In order to achieve efficiency in competence management the semantic model has been transformed into a relational database schema, which is further utilized by the system for the execution of useful queries.

To ensure the safety of high-speed trains, various train components are equipped with sensor devices for real-time moni-toring. Sensor monitoring data can be used for fast intelligent diagnosis and accurate positioning of train faults. However, existing train fault diagnosis technology based on cloud computing has disadvantages of long processing times and high consumption of computing resources, which conflict with the real-time response requirements of fault diagnosis. Aiming at the problems of train fault diagnosis in the cloud environment, this paper proposes a train fault diagnosis model based on edge and cloud collaboration. The model first utilizes a SAES-DNN (stacked auto-encoders deep neural network) fault recognition method, which can integrate automatic feature extraction and type recognition and complete fault classification over deep hidden features in high-dimensional data, so as to quickly locate faults. Next, to adapt to the characteristics of edge computing, the model applies a SAES-DNN model trained in the cloud and deployed in the edge via the transfer learning strategy and carries out real-time fault diagnosis on the vehicle sensor monitoring data. Using a motor fault as an example, when compared with a similar intelligent learning model, the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis model can greatly improve diagnosis accuracy and significantly reduce training time. Through the transfer learning approach, adaptability of the fault diagnosis algorithm for personalized applications and real-time performance of the fault diagnosis is enhanced. This paper also proposes a visual analysis method of train fault data based on knowledge graphs, which can effectively analyze fault causes and fault correlation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:27","2025-11-10 09:29:27","","1-16","","3","11","","Appl.

Aiming at the problems of complex systems with data source and cloud service center data transmission delay and untimely response, at the same time, in order to realize the perception, storage, and analysis of massive multisource heterogeneous data, a garbage detection and classification method based on visual scene understanding is proposed. This method uses knowledge graphs to store and model items in the scene in the form of images, videos, texts, and other multimodal forms. The ESA attention mechanism is added to the backbone network part of the YOLOv5 network, aiming to improve the feature extraction ability of the network, combining with the built multimodal knowledge graph to form the YOLOv5-Attention-KG model, and deploying it to the service robot to perform real-Time perception on the items in the scene. Finally, collaborative training is carried out on the cloud server side and deployed to the edge device side to reason and analyze the data in real time. The test results show that, compared with the original YOLOv5 model, the detection and classification accuracy of the proposed model is higher, and the real-Time performance can also meet the actual use requirements. The model proposed in this paper can realize the intelligent decision-making of garbage classification for big data in the scene in a complex system and has certain conditions for promotion and landing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:28","2025-11-10 09:29:28","","","","","2021","","Complexity","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Hindawi Limited","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 29; Correspondence Address: Q.

One of the stages of a monitoring problem solving, involving a UAVs distribution by the scan bands, is described. It was noted that, when this stage is being performed, there is not a possibility to take into account any factors of environment. However, it is important because of on-board energy resources limitations. This fact jeopardizes the fulfillment of the entire mission of the group. To avoid this situation, it was proposed to use a decision-making technique, based on ontological analysis, on the need to relocate the workload in a group of mobile robots. It is shown that with an increase in the number of environmental conditions changes, the time of using extra computing resources decreases, which leads to the need to engage more of them to perform the task. A comparative assessment of the amount of resources involved in the implementation of two analogous methods for solving the problem of workload relocation depending on the frequency of changes in environmental conditions is carried out. The results of experiments have shown that the effectiveness of using the ontology-based method in a dynamic environment is higher than the local device group (LDG) method. This allows to increase the time of joint mission execution by a group of robots. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:28","2025-11-10 09:29:28","","126-137","","","12998 LNAI","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The three-stage framework, including object-based image analysis, OSM data cleaning, and ontology-based decision fusion, is proposed and implemented with open-source tools. We applied the developed approach to districts 1, 4, and 7 of HoChiMinh city, representing the complexities of the dynamic change in big cities. The result showed a good functional land use map with 78.70% overall accuracy. The outcome presents the mismatch between the data-driven approach and human knowledge, which can be improved by ontology-based fusion with OSM data. The ontology-based framework comprises the common urban land-use classes and OSM attributes, which can be applied and extended in other urban areas. Additional text attributes may be applicable only locally and can be modified in our open-source framework. Object-based image analysis takes advantage of Google Earth Engine computing power, whereas ontology-based processing works well on a local computer.

The data comes from a large number of system logs, application running logs and business data, which are generated by network device, security protection device and application systems, etc., is finally stored as normalized data after word segmentation, field parsing and data type mapping. The Intranet Security Monitoring are extremely sensitive to data quality because of the efficiency and accuracy requirements, but the continuous business changes and system upgrades in the intranet environment make both of the data structure and content variable. The existing automated log parsing algorithms are mainly aimed at system logs with a fixed structure, cannot handle variable data with multiple types and structures, besides, the parsing work only completes word segmentation and field parsing. As for data type identification and mapping, there should be several security experts to wait to write static templates, in case the data is changed. In response to the above problems, an ontology model of data knowledge for Intranet Security Monitoring is constructed, and using the computing power of cloud computing, a dynamic processing algorithm for variable data (DPAVD) based on structural information entropy is proposed, in which the correlation between data fields is used as the core factor, can reduce the interference caused by the difference in character expression and meet the requirements of high-quality data for Intranet Security Monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:28","2025-11-10 09:29:28","","147-156","","","12737 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

However, this paradigm breaks down for federated query processors, as these systems do not manage the data they serve to their clients but provide a data-integration abstraction over the actual query processors that are in direct contact with the data. As a consequence, benchmark results can be greatly affected by the performance and characteristics of the underlying data services. This is further aggravated when one considers benchmarking in more realistic conditions, where internet latency and throughput between the federator and the federated data sources is also a key factor. In this paper we present KOBE, a benchmarking system that leverages modern containerization and Cloud computing technologies in order to reproduce collections of data sources. In KOBE, data sources are formally described in more detail than what is conventionally provided, covering not only the data served but also the specific software that serves it and its configuration as well as the characteristics of the network that connects them. KOBE provides a specification formalism and a command-line interface that completely hides from the user the mechanics of provisioning and orchestrating the benchmarking process on Kubernetes-based infrastructures; and of simulating network latency. Finally, KOBE automates the process of collecting and comprehending logs, and extracting and visualizing evaluation metrics from these logs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:28","2025-11-10 09:29:28","","664-679","","","12731 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

With the increasing demand for mobile WS (MWS), the WS discovery process has become a significant challenging point in the WS lifecycle that aims to identify the relevant MWSs that best match the service requests. This discovery process is a resource-consuming task that cannot be performed efficiently in a mobile computing environment due to the limitations of mobile devices. Meanwhile, a cloud computing can provide rich computing resources for mobile environments given its unlimited and easily scalable resources. This paper proposes a semantic WS discovery and invocation framework in mobile environments based on cloud and a relationship-Awarematchmaking algorithm. The discovery algorithm enriches MWS and user requests semantically with the functional and non-functional properties of Ontology Web Language for Services, such as Quality of Web Service, device context, and user preferences. The WS repository is filtered based on logical reasoning and a parameter-based matching algorithm to minimize the matching space and improve runtime performance. The cosine similarity between the user request and services repository is then assessed to generate the most relevant WS. The relationships among concepts in the ontology are considered to improve the recall and precision ratio. After the WS discovery process, users can invoke and test these services in a mobile environment through a dynamic user interface. The interface of the invocation process is changed according to theWS description document. An application prototype is also developed to evaluate the framework based on a Cordova cross-mobile development framework. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:28","2025-11-10 09:29:28","","1483-1501","","2","69","","Comput.

More and more individuals and organizations outsource large amounts of graph data to the cloud computing platform (CCP) for the sake of saving cost. As the server on CCP is not completely honest and trustworthy, the outsourcing graph data are usually encrypted before they are sent to CCP. The optimal route finding on graph data is a popular operation which is frequently used in many fields. The optimal route finding with support for semantic search has stronger query capabilities, and a consumer can use similar words of graph vertices as query terms to implement optimal route finding. Due to encrypting the outsourcing graph data before they are sent to CCP, it is not easy for data customers to manipulate and further use the encrypted graph data. In this paper, we present a solution to execute privacy-guarding optimal route finding with support for semantic search on the encrypted graph in the cloud computing scenario (PORF). We designed a scheme by building secure query index to implement optimal route finding with support for semantic search based on searchable encryption idea and stemmer mechanism. We give formal security analysis for our scheme. We also analyze the efficiency of our scheme through the experimental evaluation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:28","2025-11-10 09:29:28","","","","","2021","","Wireless Commun.

Business data can be collected using data mining from online resources, reports, operations, social media and from different sources in the big data era. Thus, BI makes use of heterogeneous data for the analysis of the past, present and future of enterprises and this is challenging; mining the data, storing in an appropriate format and managing/analysing/inferencing of the heterogeneous information is difficult. These problems can be alleviated to a great extent using Semantic Web (SW). SW provides technologies to create rich machine-understandable data that can be automatically processed, analysed and consumed by intelligent applications. Therefore, BI can benefit from SW technologies. In this paper, we review BI methods that apply SW for intelligent data mining, processing and analysis of BI procedures. In particular, we summarize and compare different properties of SW and BI methods and how they handle big data. Finally, we discuss how cloud computing technologies can be integrated with SW and BI.

As an important branch of artificial intelligence that is recently fast developing, the KG technology usually involves machine intelligence and human intelligence, especially in the creation of knowledge graphs, human participation is indispensable, which provides a good scenario for the application of crowdsourcing. This paper first briefly reviews some basic concepts of knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing and knowledge graphs. Then, it discusses three key issues on knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing from the perspectives of task type, selection of workers, and crowdsourcing processes.

This service is carried out by companies, which are ethically assessable insofar as they are “social subjects.” Their public service purpose at the three layers during the coronavirus lockdown is considered here. Within a framework of business ethics, this article looks deeply at companies as “social subjects.” They contribute decisively to a multilayered reality that reaches half of the world's population. The analysis of this network of networks is carried out through rationality and responsibility.

In order for specification of the identical operations and publication of the services on the websites, different cloud service providers tend to use completely different vocabulary. The process of requesting for a cloud service becomes merely challenging task as a result of increasing number of selection parameters and QoS constraints. Hence, a reasoning mechanism is very much required for service discovery that could resolve the resemblance appearing across different services by inferring with the respective cloud ontology.

Data were collected from the China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (CAJD) and co-word analysis method was employed to measure correlation among the extracted key words. Seventeen theme-clusters, network characteristics (centre and density), clustering strategy diagram, and correlation network are revealed through cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and social network analysis. The results show that in recent years research on LIS in China, several important research themes like Electronic Government, Reading Promotion, and Social Media have emerged with high relevance, which can be considered as concentrated, mature and well-developed. Some research topics such as Ontology, Big data, and Cloud Computing have developed on a considerable scale, while others remain isolated and undeveloped like Knowledge Sharing and Virtual Community. In addition, the current research has also identified a few of emerging research topics with great potential for development like Mobile Library, Subject Services, and User Experience.

These services mostly seem to be significantly identical in their functionality excepting their key attributes like storage, computational power, price, etc. As of now, there is no uniform specification for defining a service in the cloud domain. In order for the specification of the identical operations and publication of the services on the websites, different cloud service providers tend to use completely different vocabulary. The process of requesting for a cloud service becomes merely a challenging task as a result of increasing number of selection parameters and QoS constraints. Hence, a reasoning mechanism is very much required for service discovery that could resolve the resemblance appearing across different services with reference to the respective cloud ontology. In this paper, a semantic matchmaking technique is proposed for most relevant cloud service discovery and selection procedure based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:28","2025-11-10 09:29:28","","31-40","","","194","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Smart Innov.

Currently, cloud consumers are facing problems as they have abundant options for cloud services which may deliver similar functionalities. Moreover, discovering the best and most suitable service which meets the user requirements such as speed, cost, performance, and security is a crucial concern. In order to understand and solve this problem, a novel approach is required which can search and retrieve most suitable services as per the user’s necessities. In this paper an ontology-based cloud service discovery system is presented which can help increase the precision of cloud service discovery actually. The main goal is to categorize the cloud services along with its individualities and store them as objects using ontology. Attributes like cost, security, and SLA (service-level agreements), and so on are defined for these objects. A crawler retrieves and categorizes cloud services and stores them into ontology directory. Once the services are stored in ontology directory, this directory can be utilized for query processing, which processes the query posed by the user and ranks the obtained services based on the concerned attributes. The expected outcome of the posed query will be much accurate and appropriate according to the proposed discovery system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:28","2025-11-10 09:29:28","","193-201","","","1187","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH info@springer-sbm.com","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Adv.

Most of the approaches have high detection rate for known attacks. But in case of unknown attacks or new attacks, these intrusion detection system increases false alarm rate. Another problem is that the reduction of false alarm rate increases the computational complexities in case of genetic algorithm-based IDS and ANN-based IDS. For instance, to tackle challenges like zero-day attack, the only way is to rely upon a robust data-driven approach for security in cloud. Actually in cloud huge amount of data are processed for various activities. It is very difficult to correlate events over such huge amount of data. To improve the abilities of monitoring and fast decision-making, context management is used for correlating events and inferring contexts and evidences.

Having this situation, the software non-functional requirements such as ‘availability’ and ‘reliability’ have become critical as customers expect 24 × 7 support for their hosted applications. In such scenario, chatbot or conversational AI becomes more critical to act as the first point of contact to support customer’s queries to reduce multiple round trips between DevOps (Cloud infrastructure support team) to an extent possible. Currently, Team of MoD (manager on duty) is the first point of contact to support for any upcoming customer queries and if in need will be percolated down to team of developer on duty (DoD) for speedy issue resolution.

The capabilities of industrial robots can be encapsulated as cloud services and used for ubiquitous manufacturing. Currently, the digital models for process simulation, path simulation, etc. are encapsulated as cloud services. The digital models in the cloud may not reflect the real state of the physical robotic manufacturing systems due to inaccurate or delayed condition update and therefore result in inaccurate simulation and robotic control. Digital twin can be used to realize fine sensing control of the physical manufacturing systems by a combination of high-fidelity digital model and sensory data. In this paper, we propose a framework of digital twin-based industrial cloud robotics (DTICR) for industrial robotic control and its key methodologies. The DTICR is divided into physical IR, digital IR, robotic control services, and digital twin data. First, the robotic control capabilities are encapsulated as Robot Control as-a-Service (RCaaS) based on manufacturing features and feature-level robotic capability model. Then the available RCaaSs are ranked and parsed. After manufacturing process simulation with digital IR models, RCaaSs are mapped to physical robots for robotic control. The digital IR models are connected to the physical robots and updated by sensory data. A case is implemented to demonstrate the workflow of DTICR. The results show that DTICR is capable to synchronize and merge digital IRs and physical IRs effectively. The bidirectional interaction between digital IRs and physical IRs enables fine sensing control of IRs. The proposed DTICR is also flexible and extensible by using ontology models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-11-10 09:29:28","2025-11-10 09:29:28","","196-209","","","58","","J Manuf Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 110; Correspondence Address: B.

However, the existing action recognition methods based on the graph convolution neural networks (GCNs) can only deal with a single relation of skeletons. Even some works describe different relations of the skeleton, the adjacency matrices of different relation graphs are added together. This paper proposes a multi-relational GCNs for action recognition following the idea of describing different relations between entities by knowledge graphs. The natural connection relation, symmetric connection relation, and global connection relation of the human body parts are modeled respectively. The features of the relations are transmitted and integrated through the network, which can improve the representation ability of features. Meanwhile, this paper proposes a two-stream multi-relational graph convolution networks (2S-MRGCNs), which processes the joint flow and the body part flow of skeleton data respectively to represent the action more comprehensively.

Nevertheless, the previous methods cannot use auxiliary information from KG well. They also cannot accurately describe user-item interaction behavior so that it is challenging to construct fine-grained user preferences. To address these issues, we propose a Hybrid recommendation algorithm with Short-term preference and Knowledge preference (HSK), where the short-term preference is captured with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on users' interactive items in the short term. The knowledge preference is captured from the KG's contextual knowledge, in which the attention mechanism determines the weight of the contextual knowledge. Then add two preferences to construct the user preference. Also, explicit ratings are introduced to quantify the user-item interaction behavior at a fine-grained level. Finally, to evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness, we use three datasets MovieLens-20M, Book-Crossing, and Last.FM to verify the model and design different sparse datasets for comparative experiments. In particular, we have further visualization of relevance probability besides traditional prediction tasks.

First, a boundary prediction task is designed to determine whether a word is an entity boundary, which enhances the span representation to obtain a high quality candidate entity spans. Then, we improve GCN and constructe a span-based entity relationship graph, where the edge is the relationship and the node is the span. We evaluate Span-RG on three public datasets: ACE05, NYT and WebNLG. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the model is significantly better than the baseline method. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","513-520","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

Reasonable usage of the data will greatly improve the service quality and experience of end users. To analyze hidden activity patterns of end-user in the data, big data query is an important operation and how to enhance the query efficiency remains a challenge issue. However, different data analysis approaches have different applications in different fields, and it is necessary to mine hidden data relationships. In addition, query time is one of important factors to evaluate query efficiency, some researches however mainly focus on query result rather than evaluating query efficiency through multiple contrast approaches. To address these issues, an ontology-based modeling and semantic query strategy for mobile trajectory data is investigated in this paper. First, we respectively employ cosine similarity, point-wise mutual information (PMI) and containment probability model to mine association relationship and containment relationship hidden in the data. Subsequently, an ontology-based model is built to visualize end-user's activity through taxonomy and comparison approaches. Finally, four semantic query methods, e.g., basic query, join query, containment query and combination (join containment) query, are defined through SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) to evaluate query time, and the query efficiency achieved by these investigations has been demonstrated through the conducted experiments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","1183-1188","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

A key medical strategy that a fast-paced aging society must consider is the provision of quality long-term care (LTC) services. Even so, the lack of LTC caregivers is a persistent global problem. Herein, attention is called to the increasing need for identifying appropriate LTC caregivers and delivering client-specific LTC services to the elderly via emerging and integrative technologies. This paper argues for the use of an intelligent cloud computing long-term care platform (ICCLCP) that integrates statistical analysis, machine learning, and Semantic Web technologies into a cloudcomputing environment to facilitate LTC services delivery. The Term frequency-inverse document frequency is a numerical statistic adopted to automatically assess the professionalism of each LTC caregiver's services. The machine learning method adopts naïve Bayes classifier to estimate the LTC services needed for the elderly. These two items of LTC information are integrated with the Semantic Web to provide an intelligent LTC framework. The deployed ICCLCP will then aid the elderly in the recommendation of LTC caregivers, thereby making the best use of available resources for LTC services. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","38-55","","4","15","","Int.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: IGI Global","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Machine Learning; Machine learning; Cloud computing environments; Semantic Web technology; Text processing; Inverse problems; Intelligent computing; Bayes Classifier; Developing countries; Integrative technology; Knowledge fusion; LTC; Machine learning methods; Medical strategy; Term frequency-inverse document frequencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, a security-aware mechanism and ontology-based data access control (SA-ODAC) has been developed to improve security and access control in cloud computing. The model proposed in this research work is based on two operational methods, namely, secure awareness technique (SAT) and ontology-based data access control (ODAC), to improve security and data access control in cloud computing. The SAT technique is developed to provide security for medical data in cloud computing, based on encryption, splitting and adding files, and decryption. The ODAC ontology is launched to control unauthorized persons accessing data from storage and create owner and administrator rules to allow access to data and is proposed to improve security and restrict access to data. To manage the key of the SAT technique, the secret sharing scheme is introduced in the proposed framework. The implementation of the algorithm is performed by MATLAB, and its performance is verified in terms of delay, encryption time, encryption time, and ontology processing time and is compared with role-based access control (RBAC), context-aware RBAC and context-aware task RBAC, and security analysis of advanced encryption standard and data encryption standard.

With the advancement in this field, the number of cloud users and service providers is increasing continuously with more diversified services. Consequently, the selection of appropriate cloud service has become a difficult task for a new cloud customer. In case of inappropriate selection of a cloud services, a cloud customer may face the vendor locked-in issue and data portability and interoperability problems. These are the major obstacles in the adoption of cloud services. To avoid these complexities, a cloud customer needs to select an appropriate cloud service at the initial stage of the migration to the cloud. Many researches have been proposed to overcome the issues, but problems still exist in intercommunication standards among clouds and vendor locked-in issues. This research proposed an IEEE multiagent Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agent (FIPA) compliance multiagent reference architecture for cloud discovery and selection using cloud ontology. The proposed approach will mitigate the prevailing vendor locked-in issue and also alleviate the portability and interoperability problems in cloud computing. To evaluate the proposed reference architecture and compare it with the state-of-the-art approaches, several experiments have been performed by utilizing the commonly used performance measures.

Design/methodology/approach: propose a comprehensive knowledge base composed of interconnected Web Ontology Language, namely, modular ontology for cloud service opinion analysis (SOPA). The SOPA knowledge base will be the basis of context-aware cloud service analysis using consumers' reviews. Moreover, the authors provide a framework to evaluate cloud services based on consumers' reviews opinions. Findings: The findings show that there is a positive impact of personalizing the cloud service analysis by considering the reviewers' contexts in the performance of the framework. The authors also proved that the SOPA-based framework outperforms the available cloud review sites in term of precision, recall and F-measure. Research limitations/implications: Limited information has been provided in the semantic web literature about the relationships between the different domains and the details on how that can be used to evaluate cloud service through consumer reviews and latent opinions. Furthermore, existing approaches are lacking lightweight and modular mechanisms which can be utilized to effectively exploit information existing in social media. Practical implications: The SOPA-based framework facilitates the opinion based service evaluation through a large number of consumer's reviews and assists the end-users in analyzing services as per their requirements and their own context. Originality/value: The SOPA ontology is capable of representing the content of a product/service as well as its related opinions, which are extracted from the customer's reviews written in a specific context. Furthermore, the SOPA-based framework facilitates the opinion based service evaluation through a large number of consumer's reviews and assists the end-users in analyzing services as per their requirements and their own context. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","953-975","","5","44","","Online Info.

SLA is generally generated following a process of negotiation in which the client chooses a subset of clauses among choices predefined by the provider on a “take it or leave it” basis. However, the heterogeneity between client requests and provider offers may result in inappropriate SLA. In addition, the cloud service context may change over the time, which causes a client requirement adjustment, and therefore, the SLA becomes unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cloud SLA negotiation and re-negotiation approach. Our aim is to ameliorate the SLA negotiation phase by adding the ability to integrate a semantic mapping between client requests and provider offers to generate a suitable SLA document. Moreover, our approach includes a context-aware system to adapt the SLA throughout reasoning techniques and automatically ensure the re-negotiation. We develop a prototype, and we test its performance. The results of a case study also show the efficiency of our approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","","","","32","","","","","","","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 15 Journal Abbreviation: Concurr.

Therefore, a huge number of cloud services have been developed. Because of the diversity and heterogeneity in providing these services, it is urgently needed to develop a unified cloud ontology. Such ontology can classify these services appropriately and participate as a mapping layer to present such services in a unified description format. Although many studies have been conducted to build cloud ontologies, they have adopted the cloud service layers-based structure. On the other hand, the existing cloud services may involve functionalities from different layers due to the continual increase in the complexity of customer demands. Unfortunately, there are no clear relations to organize the interventions among these layers. Therefore, such services may be difficult to be classified into a specific cloud service layer. Additionally, the layers-based structure of ontologies represents an obstacle to address important issues, such as cloud service recommendation. Despite there are few cloud service functionality-based cloud ontologies, they suffer from many overlaps, lack of semantic relations, or poor granularity of concepts. Also, all the existing cloud ontologies (i.e., layers-based and functionality-based) lack important criteria, such as completeness, consistency, conciseness, clarity, preciseness, and granularity. In this paper, a comprehensive cloud ontology called CloudFNF has been proposed to overcome such drawbacks. According to the structure of the proposed ontology, cloud services are classified as functionality-based instead of layers-based. Also, non-functional features of cloud services (i.e., configuration and QoS features) are considered to enable services of the same functionalities to be ranked efficiently. Based on our previously suggested cloud ontology evaluation framework, our proposed cloud ontology has been evaluated compared to the most related cloud ontologies. The evaluation results show that the proposed CloudFNF ontology outperforms the other ontologies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","143-173","","","141","","J.

Unregulated and rampant collection of user and usage data by applications led to concerns on privacy, trust, and ethics. This has resulted in several governments and organizations across geographies to frame laws on data (e.g., the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) that govern and define boundaries for the storage, processing and transitioning of data; and thereby safeguard the interests of its citizens. Data Sovereignty and Data Localization are two important aspects, which deal with the adherence to the laws and governance structures, that define where and how data is collected and processed. The applicability of different laws depends upon several attributes such as the nature, type, and purpose of data. Non-compliance to laws/regulations can lead to serious repercussions for enterprises, ranging from hefty penalties to loss of brand value. Ensuring that all of their applications are complaint to various laws and regulations is non-trivial. Enterprises have to deal with a plethora of laws (that are constantly evolving) and are often confused even in correctly identifying all the applicable laws for their context leave alone ensuring compliance to regulations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a knowledge graph based data sovereignty governance framework that assists in classifying data and in identifying the relevant applicable laws. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:35:08","","303-306","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

This paper designs a distributed aggregation storage mode with the characteristics of balanced storage load distribution and local node aggregation storage under Big Table model. A distributed parallel query engine that uses the Group-By mode to distribute parallel computation query trees. A knowledge map completion method based on Bayesian inference is proposed. Bayesian probabilistic inference theory and RDF implication inference rules are used to jointly infer the potential relationships between entity nodes to predict the relationship between new nodes and original nodes, thus improving the mining efficiency of potential factors in the model and the accuracy of prediction of unknown relationships. Based on Big Table model, the entity sets stored row by row are evenly divided and stored through random prefix and pre-partition operations to realize load balancing. At the same time, random prefixes can be uniformly distributed to nodes for storing entities of the same type, and aggregated by entity category on a single node. With the continuous development of knowledge map technology, future knowledge map learning and reasoning technology can be integrated with new fields such as machine depth learning, cloud computing, block chain, big data, biological genetic engineering, etc. to play an important social value. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:29","2025-11-10 09:29:29","","","","","1544","","","","","","","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 1 Journal Abbreviation: J.

According to our conducted comprehensive survey study, the existing cloud service discovery solutions suffer from a set of drawbacks; missing a standardized and comprehensive specification of cloud services, not considering the lack of knowledge about cloud concepts, and not considering the continuous increase of the complex cloud services published to meet the complexity of the users’ demands. In this paper, a comprehensive, standardized, flexible, and intelligent cloud service discovery framework is proposed to overcome these drawbacks. According to this framework, a comprehensive ontology has been developed to provide a standardized semantic specification of cloud services based on their functional features and non-functional features. For exploiting the high performance of the relational databases in managing the large amounts of data and improving the effectiveness of the proposed framework, instances of the non- functional features’ ontological concepts are separated from the developed ontology to be stored in a relational database, where Ontop OBDA platform is used to translate the complex queries over the ontology to SQL queries that are understood by the underlying relational database source. Also, our proposed framework provides a user-centric interface that enables users with low knowledge about cloud concepts to compose complex queries using their natural English language. The effectiveness evaluation shows that the proposed framework provides better results than other solutions. According to the implementation results, the average amount of error expected to identify a service by using the proposed framework is 11% compared to 31% by using the Cloudle service discovery solution. Also, the framework achieves entirely the cloud service discovery evaluation criteria compared to 66% of these criteria for the current cloud service discovery solutions. For efficiency, the proposed framework achieves 88% F-Score for mapping cloud services into suitable functional features and 80% for discovering services that match the users’ queries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","438-466","","","106","","Future Gener Comput Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 22; Correspondence Address: M.M.

Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology, methylated cytosine sites can be revealed at the single nucleotide level. However, the WGBS data analysis process is usually complicated and challenging. Results: To alleviate the associated difficulties, we integrated the WGBS data processing steps and downstream analysis into a two-phase approach. First, we set up the required tools in Galaxy and developed workflows to calculate the methylation level from raw WGBS data and generate a methylation status summary, the mtable. This computation environment is wrapped into the Docker container image DocMethyl, which allows users to rapidly deploy an executable environment without tedious software installation and library dependency problems. Next, the mtable files were uploaded to the web server EpiMOLAS_web to link with the gene annotation databases that enable rapid data retrieval and analyses. Conclusion: To our knowledge, the EpiMOLAS framework, consisting of DocMethyl and EpiMOLAS_web, is the first approach to include containerization technology and a web-based system for WGBS data analysis from raw data processing to downstream analysis. EpiMOLAS will help users cope with their WGBS data and also conduct reproducible analyses of publicly available data, thereby gaining insights into the mechanisms underlying complex biological phenomenon.

Cloud services have inherited not only the major characteristics of web services but also their classical issues, in particular, the interoperability issues and the heterogeneous nature of their hosting environments. This latter problem must be taken into account when composing various cloud services, in order to answer users' complex requirements. Moreover, leading cloud providers started to offer their services across multiple clouds. This adds a new factor of heterogeneity, as composition engines must take into consideration the heterogeneity not only at the service level (eg, service descriptions) but also at the cloud level (eg, pricing models, security policies). In this context, the semantics of multicloud actors must be incorporated into the multicloud service composition (MCSC) process. However, most existing approaches have treated the semantic service composition in traditional single-cloud environments. The few works in multicloud settings have ignored the semantics of cloud zones and resources. Moreover, they often focus on the general aspect of MCSC (eg, horizontal or vertical compositions). Even the few researchers who have addressed both vertical and horizontal service compositions, conducted their research studies in the context of single- cloud environments, which were proven to be unrealistic and offer limited quality of service (QoS) and security support. To ensure a high interoperability when composing services from multiple heterogeneous clouds and to enable a horizontal/vertical semantic service compositions, we take advantage of a standardized and semantically enriched generic service description, including all aspects (technical, operational, business, semantic, contextual) and supporting different cloud service models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc). We also incorporate Semantic Web Rule Language into the MCSC process to enable not only rule-based reasoning about various composition constraints (eg, QoS constraints, cloud zones constraints) but also to provide accurate semantic matching of cloud services' capabilities. Conducted experiments have proven the ability of our approach to combine high-quality services from the optimal number of clouds. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","447-469","","4","50","","Software Pract Exper","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd vgorayska@wiley.com Southern Gate Chichester, West Sussex PO19 8SQ","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: S.

However, most existing search schemes based on searchable encryption only support queries in a certain language. The few searchable encryption schemes that have implemented multilingual search fail to achieve automated cross-lingual retrieval, which significantly impacts users search experience. Additionally, most of these schemes only support the exact matching and can-not provide semantic search. Hence, the implementation of cross-lingual and semantic search together remains an open topic for searchable encryption. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has investigated the problem of cross-lingual ranked search over encrypted cloud data. To address this issue, we propose a cross-lingual multi-keyword rank search (CLRSE) scheme upon the Open Multilingual Wordnet. Our CLRSE scheme can break the barrier of languages, and realizes intelligent and personalized search through flexible keyword and language preference settings. Additionally, an improved scheme is developed to speed up the sorting process.

While they are independent of each other, they can be integrated in diverse ways for developing solutions and this has been significantly explored in recent times. With the migration of web-based data and applications to cloud platforms and the evolution of the web itself from a social, web 2.0 to a semantic, web 3.0 comes as the convergence of both technologies. While several concepts and implementations have been provided regarding interactions between the two technologies from existing research, without an explicit classification of the modes of interaction, it can be quite challenging to articulate the interaction modes; hence, building upon them can be a very daunting task. Hence, this research identifies and describes the modes of interaction between them. Furthermore, a “cloud-driven” interaction mode which focuses on fully maximising cloud computing characteristics and benefits for driving the semantic web is described, providing an approach for evolving the semantic web and delivering automated semantic annotation on a large scale to web applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","5999-6014","","8","24","","Soft Comput.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 20; Correspondence Address: O.

Many user-oriented services are supported by many microservices, and the dependencies between services are more complicated than those of a traditional monolithic architecture application. In such a situation, if an anomalous change happens in the performance metric of a microservice, it will cause other related services to be downgraded or even to fail, which would probably cause large losses to dependent businesses. Therefore, in the operation and maintenance job of cloud applications, it is critical to mine the causality of the problem and find its root cause as soon as possible. In this paper, we propose an approach for mining causality and diagnosing the root cause that uses knowledge graph technology and a causal search algorithm.

Over the years, recommender systems have proven effective in overcoming the challenges related to the incredible growth of the information on the Web. In an effort to better address this problem, the use of Semantic Web technologies in the development of recommender systems has been gaining momentum in recent years. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based Collaborative Filtering recommendation approach for the discovery of services in a mobile Cloud computing platform for services-based development. Our approach employs a knowledge-based technique that takes advantage of Semantic Web rule-based reasoning capabilities. A major contribution of this work is a multi-criteria collaborative service evaluation mechanism that is based on a standard service quality framework and is built on top of an ontology-based domain model. A two-part evaluation method that is intended to evaluate the proposed recommendation approach not only from a Computer Science perspective but also from an Information Systems perspective is also presented. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","179-203","","1","54","","J Intell Inform Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: L.O.

Generally, both explicit and implicit information can be categorized according to the following assumptions: 1) Users with same behaviors are similar; 2) Items related to the same user are similar; 3) Items with same attributes are similar; and 4) Users with same interests are similar. However, none of existing studies has fully explored such information. To this end, we put forward Multi-dimension Interactions based Knowledge Graph Neural Networks (MI-KGNN), i.e., a GNN-based recommendation model that characterizes the similarity between users and items through embedding propagation in the knowledge graph. Specifically, apart from the traditional user-item and item-user interactions, we define another two types of interactions by introducing three different bipartite graphs. On one hand, we explore the interaction between items and the neighborhood during the information aggregation process. On the other hand, we explore the interaction between users and the neighborhood during embedding propagation. These interactions allow information to propagate in the direction indicated by the above four assumptions. In such a way, MI-KGNN effectively extracts both semantic information and structural information in the knowledge graph. Experimental results show that MI-KGNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in top-K recommendations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","155-170","","","12398 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

It is an increasingly challenging demand to discover trusted service providers based on services’ outputs. However, the quality of service output may descend due to: (a) internal application logic of a Cloud service and (b) competition of resources in the sharing-based Cloud systems. Therefore, we propose an efficient method of trusted service provider discovery, called TSD (Trusted Service Discovery), to ensure that each service instance of composite services in Cloud systems is trustworthy. TSD treats all services as black boxes, and evaluates the outputs of service providers in service classes to obtain their equivalent or nonequivalent relationships. According to the equivalent or nonequivalent relationships, trusted service providers can be found easily. TSD improves accuracy of processing results as shown in experiments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","246-260","","","12112 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH info@springer-sbm.com","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Although many systems rely on numerous metrics for use and optimization, few systems leverage metrics for decisional cache replacement on the mobile device. In this paper we introduce the Lowest Scored Replacement (LSR) policy—a novel cache replacement policy based on a predefined score which leverages contextual mobile data and user preferences for decisional replacement. We show an implementation of the policy using our previously proposed MOCCAD-Cache as our decisional semantic cache and our Normalized Weighted Sum Algorithm (NWSA) as a score basis. Our score normalization is based on the factors of query response time, energy spent on mobile device, and monetary cost to be paid to a cloud provider. We then demonstrate a relevant scenario for LSR, where it excels in comparison to the Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache replacement policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","237-248","","","1260 CCIS","","","","","","","","Springer","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

Although, most of the attentions, in the real world, is for the outsider attacks, however, the most damaging attacks come from the Insiders. In cloud computing, the problem becomes worst in which the number of insiders are maximized and hence, the amount of data that can be breached and disclosed is also maximized. Consequently, insiders' threats in the cloud ought to be one of the top most issues that should be handled and settled. Classical solutions to defend against insiders' threats might fail short as it is not easy to track both activities of the insiders as well as the amount of knowledge an insider can accumulate through his/her privileged accesses. Such accumulated knowledge can be used to disclose critical information –which the insider is not privileged to-through expected dependencies that exist among different data items that reside in one or more nodes of the cloud. This paper provides a solution that suits well the specialized nature of the above mentioned problem. This solution takes advantage of knowledge bases by tracking accumulated knowledge of insiders through building Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for each insider. It also takes advantage of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) by building a fog layer where a mitigation unit-resides on the edge-takes care of the insiders threats in a place that is as close as possible to the place where insiders reside. As a consequence, this gives continuous reactions to the insiders' threats in real-time, and at the same time, lessens the overhead in the cloud. The MEC model to be presented in this paper utilizes a knowledgebase approach where insiders' knowledge is tracked and modeled. In case an insider knowledge accumulates to a level that is expected to cause some potential disclosure of private data, an alarm will be raised so that expected actions should be taken to mitigate this risk. The knowledgebase approach involves generating Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Dependency Graphs (DGs) where a Threat Prediction Value (TPV) is evaluated to estimate the risk upon which alarms for potential disclosure are raised. Experimental analysis has been conducted using CloudExp simulator where the results have shown the ability of the proposed model to raise alarms for potential risks from insiders in a real time fashion with accurate precision. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","621-628","","4A, Special Issue 2020","17","","Int.

One of the key challenges in cloud computing therefore is to enhance RDF data model. This paper introduces a data model which uses hybrid approach of provenance aware context entity (PACE) and quadruples method of reification. The scope of the research is to understand the importance of RDF reification, limitations and its impact on creating an efficient data model.

Worldwide, governmental organizations have contributed to this reality through Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs), promoting economic development, stimulating better governance, and fostering environmental sustainability. These initiatives have been settled according to three stages of development. Recently, the community is witnessing an emerging fourth stage in the SDI evolution, because of mainstream Information Technologies (IT), and where different IT trends (such as Big Data, cloud computing, or Semantic Web) are already being integrated as part of SDIs worldwide. Nevertheless, their implementation states change among countries according to the initial context and the Digital Divide. Therefore, it is essential to understand the adoption process characteristics, and especially in Latin America, where no previous evidence about the state of geospatial IT trend adoption is available. This paper contributes to an exploratory inquiry for unveiling the diversity of the fourth SDI generation in the Latin American SDI community. For that, we used an open-regional web-based survey, which was divided into four blocks (trend adoption, standardization, monitoring, and future vision and limitations) and performed three times (2014, 2017, 2018/2019). The results depicted the initial presence of IT trends with a heterogeneity scenario. In this way, some initiatives are exploring the fourth generation, while others remain at different stages between the first and third generations. This work pointed out the need for a regional observatory to allow designing policies and action plans associated with the progress of the fourth SDI generation in Latin America. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","508-523","","","","","Cartogr.

The character-matching search functions of website can hardly meet users’ requirements. Furthermore, building the content of webpages of a specific web-site and the associated rules is uneconomical. This paper, based on the framework of the Lucene engine, applied a semantic ontology, the calculation of the relevance of word entries, and the semantics of keywords to design an intelligent semantic recommendation system with the Jena secondary semantic analysis technique. Subsequently, the expanded keywords were semantically ranked based on the term frequency analysis technique. Meanwhile, the ontology algorithm and their relevance were introduced as the dynamic weight values. Finally, in the text content retrieval process, the search results were ranked based on the previous relevance weights. The experimental results show that the system designed in this paper is not only easy to develop but also capable of expanding users queries and recommending relevant content. Further, the system can improve the precision and recall for website search results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:30","2025-11-10 09:29:30","","200-209","","","322 LNICST","","","","","","","","Springer","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Our proposal is based on a consumer-centric approach, since it deals with cloud trust aspects from the perspective of end users. For this purpose, metrics and indicators are proposed to allow consumers to assess the trust of cloud services providers.

These organizations turn to multicloud, which involves the use of two or more public clouds, to avoid vendor lock-in, overcome latency, mitigate risks, and control costs. The use of multicloud does have some advantages, such as flexibility and redundancy, but comes with some management, security, and privacy challenges as well. To overcome some of the security challenges, organizations would have to capture and analyze security and privacy policies across multiple clouds to ensure the policies are free from errors and enforce them at runtime independent of the cloud provider. In this paper, we present CERBERUS, a framework for representing multicloud security and privacy policies and detecting potential problems in the policies. CERBERUS adopts an object-oriented approach and consists of an ontology and notation, policies, guidelines and rules, and a tool for capturing and detecting policy errors. Using CERBERUS, policies can be analyzed for potential problems, including policy conflicts, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness. An application of CERBERUS shows that it indeed helps discover policy errors, that would otherwise go undetected, or in many cases would be detected a posteriori at runtime. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","57-68","","","12019 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The existing research mainly focuses on keyword-based search schemes, most of which support the exact matching of keywords. However, keyword-based search schemes ignore spelling errors and semantic expansions of keywords. The significant drawback makes the existing techniques unsuitable in cloud computing as it greatly affects system usability and can not completely satisfy the users' search intentions. In this paper, we propose an effective fuzzy semantic searchable encryption scheme (FSSE) that supports multi-keyword search over encrypted data in cloud computing. In our scheme, we exploit a keyword fingerprint generation algorithm to generate a fingerprint set of the keyword dictionary and a fingerprint of the query keywords, and employ Hamming distance to quantify keywords similarity. Based on the proposed fingerprint generation algorithm and Hamming distance, we realize fuzzy search. Furthermore, we utilize the semantic expansion technique to expand query keywords and calculate the semantic similarity between the query keywords and the expanded word of the query keywords to achieve the semantic search. To improve the search efficiency, we construct an inverted index structure and use the vector intersection matching as well as short-circuit matching operations to effectively filter irrelevant documents. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme satisfies the security guarantee of searchable encryption, enhances system usability, and is more efficient in comparison with the state of the art schemes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","71893-71906","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 24; Correspondence Address: G.

It has emerged as a compelling paradigm that assures reliable on-demand computing services over Internet. However, the potential that this new model offers for organizations is still not fully explored. In fact, this technology has not been explored yet to manage Loose Inter-Organizations Cooperation (LIOC). Loose Inter-Organizations Cooperation corresponds to occasional cooperation without structural constraints in which the partners involved and their numbers are not predefined. In order to handle LIOC in Cloud Computing we have proposed the notion of Cloud Workflow Services (CWS). CWS is an Inter-Organizations business process having loosely coupled fragments of process that we called Process Chunks (PCs) whose description and execution are accessible through the Cloud. In our previous work, we have used the Model-Driven Engineering approach to deal with modeling and specifying Contextualized Flexible Cloud Workflow Services. In this work, we focus on the selection of PCs. We propose an ontology based approach permitting a PC_Consumer to select the appropriate PC satisfying its requirements. This selection is done according to two different strategies “MIC-selection” and “MAC-selection”. In MIC-Selection, every PC will be selected using the assembling strategy, that’s mean we have the possibility to assemble multiple PCs. In MAC-Selection, for each PC we will select only the best PC with the highest score of similarity. This work has been validated through the “Drug Development process” with the help of experts from the pharmaceutical field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","261-278","","","381 LNBIP","","","","","","","","Springer","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Enterprise data warehouses have emerged as central resources for these data, but often require an informatician to extract meaningful information, limiting direct access by end users. To overcome this challenge, we have developed Leaf, a lightweight self-service web application for querying clinical data from heterogeneous data models and sources. Materials and Methods: Leaf utilizes a flexible biomedical concept system to define hierarchical concepts and ontologies. Each Leaf concept contains both textual representations and SQL query building blocks, exposed by a simple drag-and-drop user interface. Leaf generates abstract syntax trees which are compiled into dynamic SQL queries. Results: Leaf is a successful production-supported tool at the University of Washington, which hosts a central Leaf instance querying an enterprise data warehouse with over 300 active users. Through the support of UW Medicine (https://uwmedicine.org), the Institute of Translational Health Sciences (https://www.iths.org), and the National Center for Data to Health (https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/), Leaf source code has been released into the public domain at https://github.com/uwrit/leaf. Discussion: Leaf allows the querying of single or multiple clinical databases simultaneously, even those of different data models. This enables fast installation without costly extraction or duplication. Conclusions: Leaf differs from existing cohort discovery tools because it does not specify a required data model and is designed to seamlessly leverage existing user authentication systems and clinical databases in situ. We believe Leaf to be useful for health system analytics, clinical research data warehouses, precision medicine biobanks, and clinical studies involving large patient cohorts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","109-118","","1","27","","J.

In this study, three encoder-decoder architectures using convolutional neural network are applied to segment the eyes. A simple encoder-decoder architecture is capable of generating only coarse segmentation results. On the other hand, fine details like eyelashes can be achieved by U-net and SegNet architectures. However, they sometimes produce overall results worse than the simple one. To resolve this problem, we introduce a deep convolutional neural network-based ensemble technique for eye segmentation. The results from those architectures are combined in order to yield good results in both coarse-level and fine-level segmentation. In the proposed technique, a trainable mask function is applied to achieve an optimal ensemble of coarse-level and fine-level results. Our dataset comprises 64 eye images from different environments, camera settings, people, and eye conditions. Experimental results show that our ensemble technique can improve the results from the conventional architectures. The proposed ensemble method manages to reach the average accuracy of 96.33% for three-class segmentation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","43-50","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

The SW creates a distributed framework to publish, query, and reuse information [3]. The key backbones of SW are ontologies and annotations that provide semantics for raw data are known as Resource Description Framework (RDF) data [4]. The RDF data can also be published over Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. To highlight the vision of SW, we would like to run a tutorial.

In recent years, with the availability of electronic medical records (EMRs), many researchers have focused on diagnose diseases by mining EMRs. They apply machine learning algorithms to train EMRs, and modify models to improve the accuracy of diseases diagnosis. However, these studies input the patient characteristics into the model at once, without multiple online interactions. Or, put another way, although those methods have performed well in the laboratory, they are not suitable for a real consultation environment. In the real world, doctors often guide patients to describe the condition step by step, and then combine the checkup value to diagnose the disease. In this paper, we simulate this process and propose a novel system called DKDR, which combine a knowledge graph and deep reinforcement learning to diagnose disease. The medical knowledge graph is built by crawling 100K web pages, which help users improve the description of disease characteristics. We use q-learning to find the combination of symptoms in the best diagnosis and use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to train each strategy. Finally, we experiment on real medical datasets and synthetic medical datasets. DKDR finds the best combination of symptoms for diagnosing disease. The diagnostic accuracy rates for pneumonia, hyperlipidemia and obesity are 89%, 90% and 92%, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","1303-1308","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Intl Conf Parallel Distrib.

It also establishes a reusable extended resource expression model. At the same time, the use of the third-party tool Jena for OWL semantic query also gives the monitoring system the characteristics of a rapid semantic query, which further enhances the convenience of cloud resource management. In addition, based on the application of ontology, we also introduce multivariate decision diagram (MDD) multi-valued decision graph technology, which allows B-CMS to self-diagnose complex system faults.

Hence, it can be utilized for modeling the latent semantics among texts. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-persevering searchable encryption scheme based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. Documents are modeled by LDA, and the concept of topics is utilized to generate a document-topic relevance matrix and query topic vectors. The matrix is used as the index for the proposed scheme. The secure inner product operation is adopted to encrypt the index and query topic vectors, which provides accurate topic relevance score calculation between encrypted index and trapdoors.

However, nowadays the business data are extremely increasing, and many companies have already opted for Big Data systems deployed in cloud environments, then the process of generating association rules becomes very hard. To deal with this issue, we propose an approach using ontology with rule patterns to integrate users' knowledge early in the preprocessing step before searching or generating any rule.

Because the existing three categories of cloud computing business mode are partially overlapped, the customary SPI model as a basis for patent analysis is unable to grasp the development status of cloud computing correctly. The aims of this study are to obtain clustering of cloud patent with overlapping claims and to identify the intellectual structure of different research themes in the development of cloud computing. This study first proposes an ontology-based compound retrieval policy to retrieve three non-overlapped cloud patents. We then propose a new overlapping cluster algorithm using the patents with the highest degree centralities as the initial central points for clustering, and utilizing the Taguchi and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution methods for integrating the clustering quality-related indices. Based on the database of the three overlapped clusters of cloud computing patents, we propose a group technology-based co-word analysis, incorporating with the visual methods of social network analysis and multivariate analysis, to investigate the R&D themes in each service mode of cloud computing.

The existing achievements are mainly focused on keyword-based search schemes, and almost all of them depend on predefined keywords extracted in the phases of index construction and query. However, keyword-based search schemes ignore the semantic representation information of users' retrieval and cannot completely match users' search intention. Therefore, how to design a content-based search scheme and make semantic search more effective and context-aware is a difficult challenge. In this paper, for the first time, we define and solve the problems of semantic search based on conceptual graphs (CGs) over encrypted outsourced data in clouding computing (SSCG). We first employ the efficient measure of sentence scoring in text summarization and Tregex to extract the most important and simplified topic sentences from documents. We then convert these simplified sentences into CGs. To perform quantitative calculation of CGs, we design a new method that can map CGs to vectors. Next, we rank the returned results based on text summarization score. Furthermore, we propose a basic idea for SSCG and give a significantly improved scheme to satisfy the security guarantee of searchable symmetric encryption (SSE). Finally, we choose a real-world dataset, i.e., the CNN dataset to test our scheme. The results obtained from the experiment show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","813-823","","5","12","","IEEE Trans.

Maintenance knowledge of historic buildings has extensive and specific knowledge, but a small number of experts provide most of experience. With the rapid development of building information modelling (BIM), it can facilitate maintenance management of historic buildings. Recently, research on connecting ontology and BIM was discussed to promote building knowledge management (BKM). However, BKM is less applied in historic buildings and connection strength is also less discussed. Connection strength of knowledge mapping can increase the performance of knowledge retrieval. Therefore, this study aims to build connection between maintenance ontology of historic buildings and BIM, and also proposes a cloud model-based knowledge mapping method to evaluate the connection strength. This study uses FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis) to connect ontology and BIM, and the grey relational analysis to evaluate the connection strength. Meanwhile, cloud model is integrated into FMEA to better deal with uncertain information to increase the reliability. This study adopts a real case to valid the practicability. The results show the proposed method can evaluate the connection strengths with uncertain information and obtain the maintenance knowledge more efficiently. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","3285-3296","","8","23","","KSCE J.

Skilled management and reuse of snippets can improve programming efficiency in practice. However, we find that most snippets are posted to online blogs or snippet management systems with little description and tagging, which leads to an embarrassing situation in which existing snippets are difficult to reuse. This occurs because snippets are usually hastily pushed to online services or saved in text files by programmers and also because existing management systems do not provide efficient labeling and reusing frameworks. In this paper, we propose to annotate snippets with a well-formed domain-specific ontology—programming ontology. With a thorough investigation of real world snippets, we designed a programming ontology to annotate and recommend snippets. We show how to annotate a snippet with ontology terms based on text classification models. In addition, we built a snippet management system that stores user snippets in the cloud and automatically recommends snippets, so that the retrieval of snippets becomes trivial in popular integrated developing environments, such as Eclipse and Visual Studio. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the ontology annotation algorithm is able to automatically annotate a snippet with a high degree of accuracy. The shared domain knowledge also makes it possible to share snippets among programmers and systems. As the number of labeled snippets increases, deep learning models can be trained and used to annotate code snippets with high accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:31","2025-11-10 09:29:31","","2971-2985","","8","10","","J.

Users share these resources in large-scale environments over the Internet. Stringent access control must be implemented in a cloud storage system for protecting sensitive information. Access control models in the current literature such as Discretionary Access control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control model (MAC), Role-Based Access Model (RBAC) or Attribute Access Control Model (ABAC) consider the entities of access control in isolation and thus leading to incorrect access control decisions. In this paper, Ontology-Based Access Control is proposed. This proposal uses an ontology to model the entities associated with access control and their interrelationships among them, which could be effortlessly adjusted to Cloud environments. Ontology promises to streamline knowledge sharing among the entities. Subsumption property is exploited over concepts, properties and individuals. The experimental results show that the number of rules to be stored in Policy Base is reduced and reasoning time is also considerably reduced because of applying subsumption property and hence access decision is made faster. Also, our work is compared with the existing works against the state of art models with the help of access control metrics provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Our work answers the queries related to metric effectively than the existing works. Hence the performance of the system is increased and suitable for securing cloud data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","","","3","12","","Int.

This has allowed devices such as smartphones, tablets, and personal digital assistants to perform increasingly complex tasks, up to the point of efficiently replacing traditional options such as desktop computers and notebooks. However, due to their portability and size, these devices are more prone to theft, to become compromised, or to be exploited for attacks and other malicious activity. The need for investigation of the aforementioned incidents resulted in the creation of the Mobile Forensics (MF) discipline. MF, a sub-domain of digital forensics, is specialized in extracting and processing evidence from mobile devices in such a way that attacking entities and actions are identified and traced. Beyond its primary research interest on evidence acquisition from mobile devices, MF has recently expanded its scope to encompass the organized and advanced evidence representation and analysis of future malicious entity behavior. Nonetheless, data acquisition still remains its main focus. While the field is under continuous research activity, new concepts such as the involvement of cloud computing in the MF ecosystem and the evolution of enterprise mobile solutions-particularly mobile device management and bring your own device-bring new opportunities and issues to the discipline.

To this aim, an ontology based on a conceptual map derived from the data-to-information transformation is here proposed to support the design of a new generation of Farm Information Systems (FIS) able to fit the production needs of agri-environmental enterprises. The data-to-information cycle is split into four phases: A) Data collection, B) Data processing, C) Data analysis and evaluation, and D) Use of information. Phases A and D comprise tools of ""light digitization"" typically referring to OLTP components (On Line Transactional Processes). On their turn, phases B and C are typically formed by ""heavy digitization"" components (On Line Analytical Processes), generally more complicated to be managed by the farmers directly. The conceptual map defined by the ontology is firstly useful to plan the composition of the FIS according to a modular approach, possibly following a strategy that starts to consider the introduction of OLTP components, for then evolving gradually towards more articulated solutions that include also OLAP component and related functions. In this way, decision makers can manage practical planning instrument able to show clearly the level of complexity a FIS can reach, thus evaluating its sustainability with respect to the financial, cultural and professional resources available at the farm. Finally, after having underlined the opportunities offered by Cloud Computing and widespread connectivity, that provide an easier adoption of OLAP tools, some application cases are presented and discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","","","","275","","","","","","","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 1 Journal Abbreviation: IOP Conf.

Additionally, it does not require a predefined keyword set and support keywords in arbitrary languages. However, due to the pattern of exact matching of keywords in the new MRSE scheme, multilingual search is limited to each language and cannot be searched across languages.

However, privacy is the major concern in the cloud, as it is essential to manage the confidentiality in the data shared. In the first work, the privacy preservation model was developed by newly designed Kronecker product based Bat algorithm. Here, the previous work is extended by developing the classification algorithm for classifying the privacy preserved database. Initially, the Kronecker product based Bat algorithm finds the privacy preserved database from the original medical data. Then, the ontology based features are extracted from the privacy preserved database and given to the data classifier. Here, a classifier, named Whale based Sine Cosine Algorithm with Support Vector Neural Network (WSCA-SVNN), is newly developed for the data classification. The proposed WSCA algorithm helps in optimally choosing the weights for SVNN classifier, and finally, the WSCA-SVNN classifier classifies the medical data. The simulation of the proposed privacy preserved data classification network is done by utilizing the heart disease database. The analysis shows that the proposed WSCA-SVNN classifier scheme achieved an accuracy value of 90.29% during medical data classification. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","","","3","28","","Int.

Although cloud technology has characteristics that distinguish it from other technologies, unfortunately, services in this technology suffer from the heterogeneity issue. As a result, cloud services have many challenges, such as service description, interoperability, and service discovery. Many studies have contributed dealing with such challenges using ontology, as it can participate as a mapping layer to present such services in a unified description. Cloud ontologies included in these studies can be classified into three types of ontologies; ontologies that focus on representing functional features of cloud services, ontologies that focus on non-functional features, and ontologies that focus on both function and non-function features. These ontologies are not unified in representing such features, where they agree in some features and differ in others. By using techniques developed to evaluate ontologies related to the other technologies, it is difficult to decide which cloud ontology captures cloud services in the right way. We have noticed that there is not a framework or a benchmark to evaluate the cloud ontologies. In this survey, the current cloud ontologies are analyzed to identify a set of observations that represent their strengths and weaknesses. According to these observations, a set of suggested rules are introduced and verified to be considered during the construction or the evaluation of cloud ontologies.

The tasks involved in making cloud services available, such as matchmaking, selection and composition, are essential and closely related to each other. Integration of these tasks is critical for optimal composition and performance of the cloud service platform. More efficient solutions could be developed by considering cloud service tasks collectively, but the research and academic community have so far only considered these tasks individually. The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated QoS-based approach for cloud service matchmaking, selection and composition using the Semantic Web. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a new approach using the Semantic Web and quality of service (QoS) model to perform cloud service matchmaking, selection and composition, to fulfil the requirements of an end user. In the Semantic Web, the authors develop cloud ontologies to provide semantic descriptions to the service provider and requester, so as to automate the cloud service tasks. This paper considers QoS parameters, such as availability, throughput, response time and cost, for quality assurance and enhanced user satisfaction. Findings: This paper focus on the development of an integrated framework and approach for cloud service life cycle phases, such as discovery, selection and composition using QoS, to enhance user satisfaction and the Semantic Web, to achieve automation. To evaluate performance and usefulness, this paper uses a scenario based on a Healthcare Decision-Making System (HDMS). Results derived through the experiment prove that the proposed prototype performs well for the defined set of cloud-services tasks. Originality/value: As a novel concept, our proposed integrated framework and approach for cloud service matchmaking, selection and composition based on the Semantic Web and QoS characterisitcs (availability, response time, throughput and cost), as part of the service level agreement (SLA) will help the end user to match, select and filter cloud services and integrate cloud-service providers into a multi-cloud environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","63-89","","1","21","","J.

Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) provides a set of best design principles to create interoperable REST management APIs. Although OCCI is the only standard addressing the management of any kind of cloud resources, it does not support a range of best principles related to REST design. This often worsens REST API quality by decreasing their understandability and reusability. Objective: We aim at assisting cloud developers to enhance their REST management APIs by providing a compliance evaluation of OCCI and REST best principles and a recommendation support to comply with these principles. Method: First, we leverage patterns and anti-patterns to drive respectively the good and poor practices of OCCI and REST best principles. Then, we propose a semantic-based approach for defining and detecting REST and OCCI (anti)patterns and providing a set of correction recommendations to comply with both REST and OCCI best principles. We validated this approach by applying it on cloud REST APIs and evaluating its accuracy, usefulness and extensibility. Results: We found that our approach accurately detects OCCI and REST(anti)patterns and provides useful recommendations. According to the compliance results, we reveal that there is no widespread adoption of OCCI principles in existing APIs. In contrast, these APIs have reached an acceptable level of maturity regarding REST principles. Conclusion: Our approach provides an effective and extensible technique for defining and detecting OCCI and REST (anti)patterns in Cloud REST APIs. Cloud software developers can benefit from our approach and defined principles to accurately evaluate their APIs from OCCI and REST perspectives. This contributes in designing interoperable, understandable, and reusable Cloud management APIs. Thank to the compliance analysis and the recommendation support, we also contribute to improving these APIs, which make them more straightforward. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","65-82","","","107","","Inf Software Technol","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: H.

The methods described earlier suffer to achieve higher result in public auditing. To overcome the challenges in public auditing, the author propose a hierarchical attribute based encryption based modular padding scheme. The method organizes the cloud data in hierarchical manner and each level of attributes has been stored in semantic manner. The semantic relations of the attributes are used to select the key parameter and the same is used to encrypt or decrypt the cloud data. The semantic ontology maintains the category of data attributes and for each data attribute the ontology refers a secret key. The key from the semantic ontology is selected and the same is used to perform verification. Again the encrypted data is performed with modular padding, which selects the random number and based on the value of random number, a padding of 1 or 0 is performed.

Software and hardware are now commodities leased on demand. Because computer systems leased from a cloud service provider, virtual machines, are typically connected to internet, they can host web services, which are frequently components of service oriented architectures (SOAs). Such architectures have recently been adopted in factory automation, as they allow systems to reach high levels of decentralization and loose-coupling. SOA-based Factory automation systems combine physical production equipment with web services that belong to the information processing (cyber) domain, and they are therefore highly cyber-physical. When some of the services are deployed on cloud resources, SOA-based factory automation systems can be classified cloud-based cyber-physical systems. Each service in such a system is typically able to perform rather simple, atomic operations, whereas achievement of complex goals requires that the services be composed to collaboratively carry out workflows. This article investigates the use of cloud resources in automatic service workflow composition. To facilitate the acquisition and utilization of cloud resources, a system of two specialized web services is proposed. The system includes a web service that dynamically deploys virtual machines to carry out planning processes, thereby exhibiting artificial intelligence. Finally, this paper demonstrates the integration of the system with a previously proposed semantic web service composition framework. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","687-700","","2","30","","J Intell Manuf","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 20; Correspondence Address: A.

In this scenario, ontologies not only serve as common message exchange structure among distributed agents but also provide reasoning capability to extract implicit knowledge from explicit information already stored in the knowledge base. Foundation ontologies (upper-level), comprised of most general concepts of a domain, provide a common semantic structure to the domain-level ontologies, which capture details of multi-disciplinary manufacturing knowledge. In this paper, novel upper-level ontology, called SIMPM (Semantically Integrated Manufacturing Planning Model), is proposed in order to model three fundamental constraints of manufacturing process planning: variety, time, and aggregation. The philosophical underpinning of the proposed ontology – presented as OWL-DL axioms – is derived from a three dimensional planning model, developed during our past research on computer-aided process planning. As part of the evaluation of SIMPM ontology, we first expound on the interoperability issues with other upper-level manufacturing ontologies. Next, we present a case study on process planning for prismatic part design. In this way, we demonstrate how the generic set of proposed axioms may be used to address various manufacturing process planning concerns, such as alternative manufacturing resources, the temporal order among operations and granularity in the details of a process plan. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","183-198","","","55","","Rob Comput Integr Manuf","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 54; Correspondence Address: D.

In all phases of disaster risk management including forecasting, emergency response and post-disaster reconstruction, the need for interconnected multidisciplinary open data for collaborative reporting as well as study and analysis are apparent, in order to determine disaster impact data in timely and reportable manner. The extraordinary progress in computing and information technology in the past decade, such as broad local and wide-area network connectivity (e.g. Internet), high-performance computing, service and cloud computing, big data methods and mobile devices, provides the technical foundation for connecting open data to support disaster risk research. A new generation of disaster data infrastructure based on interconnected open data is evolving rapidly. There are two levels in the conceptual model of Linked Open Data for Global Disaster Risk Research (LODGD) Working Group of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA), which is the Committee on Data of the International Council for Science (ICSU): data characterization and data connection. In data characterization, the knowledge about disaster taxonomy and data dependency on disaster events requires specific scientific study as it aims to understand and present the correlation between specific disaster events and scientific data through the integration of literature analysis and semantic knowledge discovery. Data connection concepts deal with technical methods to connect distributed data resources identified by data characterization of disaster type. In the science community, interconnected open data for disaster risk impact assessment are beginning to influence how disaster data are shared, and this will need to extend data coverage and provide better ways of utilizing data across domains where innovation and integration are now necessarily needed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","45-58","","1","22","","Geo-Spatial Inf.

The bag-of-words model also ignores the semantic information between keywords and documents, which could return non-relevant search results to users. The neutral-network based natural language processing method - Doc2Vec model use word's and paragraph's context information to extract documents' features. The features contain latent semantics information and can measure the similarity between documents. In this paper, we adopt the Doc2Vec model to achieve a semantic-aware multikeyword ranked search scheme. Doc2Vec model uses the distributed representation of words and documents with a modest dimensionality of vectors while trained on a dataset with a few hundred of millions of words. Documents' distributed representations are extracted as documents feature vector by Doc2Vec model and utilized as the search index. The features of the queried keywords are also extracted as the query feature vector, and the secure inner product operation is adopted to achieve privacy-preserving semantic search with the query feature vector and index. Our scheme can support dynamic update on the document set with Doc2Vec model. The experiment on a real-world dataset shows that the fixed-length feature vector can improve the time and space efficiency on the semantic-aware search. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:32","2025-11-10 09:29:32","","142855-142865","","","7","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 14; Correspondence Address: H.

Robotics technology can accomplish these demands, but programming and re-configuration of robots are associated with high costs, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The use of digital twins can significantly reduce these costs by providing monitoring and simulation capabilities for the robot and its environment using real-time data. The integration with an ontology as a knowledge base to describe the robot and its 3d-environment enables an automatic configuration of the digital twin and the particular robot. In this paper, this concept is coupled with cloud-computing to enable an effortless integration as service in existing cloud architectures and easy access using the common web-technology-stack for the end-users. A novel architecture is presented and implemented to incorporate the real system with its digital twin, the ontology and a planner to infer the actual operations from the knowledge base.

According to the model attributes (such as model name, domain, type, time scale, model granularity, etc.) and the model correlation (such as equipment model carrying relationship, etc.) set by users, the initial set of simulation models satisfying the requirements is found based on semantic search. Then, an optimization selection mechanism based on QoS is proposed to support users in customizing the weights of the QoS indices.

Even though the SLA is used to specify the level of services provided and the guarantee where negotiated conditions are specified, customers are not always satisfied. In order to promote the use of SLA without any ambiguities in quality requirements definitions, it is useful to develop an ontology-based support tool that automate the process of generating SLA regarding the interaction among the ISO 25010 quality characteristics. We propose an approach that uses ontology to semantically classify the quality requirements into the quality characteristics such as described by ISO 25010 and define their relationships. Taking into account customer requirements and considering their interactions before using cloud service is one of the most important and difficult tasks of SLA establishment. Ontology is used to semantically define diverging quality requirements and their relationships. In order to show the applicability of our approach, a tool for SLA generation is implemented and tested. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:33","2025-11-10 09:29:33","","663-675","","","11683 LNAI","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The implementation of crosscutting concerns could potentially lead to a significant impact on the integrity of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), as well as code quality. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) encapsulates the crosscutting concerns to improve the overall quality of software development by reducing the required code to implement collection modules. In this paper, we propose an AOP-based novel approach to improve the elasticity of cloud-based EHR services. We propose an abstract framework for cloud-based HIS, which provides EHR interoperability through incorporating crosscutting concerns. The proposed framework eliminates the need to change the core code by adding high-level abstractions to complex cloud applications.

Yet, due mainly to security and privacy concerns, many enterprises are reluctant to migrate the storage and processing of their critical assets to the cloud. One way to alleviate these concerns, hence bolster the adoption of cloud computing, is to infuse suitable access control policies in cloud services. Nevertheless, the complexity inherent in such policies, stemming from the dynamic nature of cloud environments, calls for a framework capable of providing assurances with respect to the effectiveness of these policies. The work presented in this paper elaborates on such a framework. In particular, it proposes an approach for generically checking potential subsumption relations between access control policies that incorporate the contextual knowledge that characterises an access request and which needs to be taken into account for granting, or denying, the request. The proposed framework is expressed ontologically hence enabling automated reasoning, through semantic inferencing, about policy subsumption. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:33","2025-11-10 09:29:33","","355-362","","","","","","","","","","","SciTePress","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CLOSER - Proc.

MicroRNA s (miRNA s or miRs) serve important roles in the physiological and pathological process of PCO S. To identify PCO S-associated miRNA s, the dataset GSE84376 was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed miRNA s (DE- miRNA s) were obtained from Gene-C loud Biotechnology Information and potential target genes were predicted using TargetScan, DIANA- microT-CD S, miRD B and miRTarBase tools. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape. Transcription factors were obtained from FunRich. DE-miRNAs were verified by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR . At the screening phase, there were seven DE- miRNA s in the PCO S group not present in the control group. In total, 935 target genes were identified, which are involved in the development and maturation of oocytes. Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, phosphatase and tensin homolog, cAMP responsive element binding protein 1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, interferon γ, Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1, transcription factor p65, insulin receptor substrate 1, DnaJ homolog superfamily C member 10 and casein kinase 2 a 1 were identified as the top 10 hub genes in the protein-protein interaction network. Specificity protein 1 was the most enriched transcription factor. At the validation phase, the levels of Homo sapiens (hsa)-miR- 3188 and hsa-miR-3135b were significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group. In addition, the expression level of hsa-miR-3135b was significantly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved, the fertilization rate and the cleavage rate (P<0.05). The present bioinformatics study on miRNA s may offer a novel understanding of the mechanism of PCO S, and may serve to identify novel miRNA therapeutic targets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:33","2025-11-10 09:29:33","","281-291","","1","20","","Mol.

A Cloud provider delivers Cloud services to businesses or individuals. However, each Cloud provider uses its own techniques to describe their Cloud services. It is therefore difficult to compare Cloud offers and then provide the appropriate service to the user. Especially that the Cloud services can provide the same functionalities, but they differ by their quality of service, price, Cloud characteristics, service credibility, and so on. The variety of these techniques is due to the lack of Cloud service description standardization. To deal with such issues, we propose in this paper a Cloud service description ontology that assists the Cloud service publication, discovery and selection processes. The proposed description will be extended from the Linked USDL language to describe Cloud services thanks to its expressiveness by covering four aspects namely technical, operational, business and semantic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:33","2025-11-10 09:29:33","","359-373","","","11496 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Objectives Compare documentation of relevant clinical information in electronic health record (EHR) provider note to computed tomography (CT) order requisition, prior to ordering of head CT for emergency department (ED) patients presenting with headache. Methods In this institutional review board-approved retrospective observational study performed between April 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014 at an adult quaternary academic hospital, we reviewed data from 666 consecutive ED encounters for patients with headaches who received head CT. The primary outcome was the number of concept unique identifiers (CUIs) relating to headache extracted via ontology-based natural language processing from the history of present illness (HPI) section in ED notes compared with the number of concepts obtained from the imaging order requisition. Results Our analysis was conducted on cases where the HPI note section was completed prior to image order entry, which occurred in 23.1% (154/666) of encounters. For these 154 encounters, the number of CUIs specific to headache per note extracted from the HPI (median = 3, interquartile range [IQR]: 2-4) was significantly greater than the number of CUIs per encounter obtained from the imaging order requisition (median = 1, IQR: 1-2; Wilcoxon signed rank p < 0.0001). Extracted concepts from notes were distinct from order requisition indications in 92.9% (143/154) of cases. Conclusion EHR provider notes are a valuable source of relevant clinical information at the time of imaging test ordering. Automated extraction of clinical information from notes to prepopulate imaging order requisitions may improve communication between ordering physicians and radiologists, enhance efficiency of ordering process by reducing redundant data entry, and may help improve clinical relevance of clinical decision support at the time of order entry, potentially reducing provider burnout from extraneous alerts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2019","2025-11-10 09:29:33","2025-11-10 09:29:33","","189-198","","2","10","","Appl.

Taking advantages from both semantic expression in dependence record types (DRT) and completeness of service description in session types (ST), this paper presents a novel method for service composition verification at semantic level. Based on the characteristics of DRT, an ontology approach is proposed to enrich DRTs semantic description and establish a set of subtyping rules to characterize relationships of transmitted messages among services. As a general service composition description and semantic verification method, message DRT extended multiparty session types (MDRT-MST) are then constructed. A theoretical justification on the main patterns of service composition models is given through the extended reduction rules. As a case study, an online payment system is implemented for evaluating the system performance in practice. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in service reduction and verification for the real-world SaaS applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:33","2025-11-10 09:29:33","","101-118","","","469","","Inf Sci","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: D.

The main components of any biometric system, such as biometric sensing, data gathering, feature extraction, identification, verification, recognition, and analytics, are now handled over distributed networks. Many of the biometric system services are presented over such networks which are followed by the creation of a new concept ‘biometric-as-a-service (BaaS)’. Recent BaaS approaches usually focus on identifying the effective distributed architectures, policies, and use case recommendations. However, there is a strong need to focus on developing a semantic framework which should rely on a biometric ontology. This study presents such an ontology covering the uses of different biometric modalities, evaluation and assessment of biometric systems, modelling biometric processes, and analyses through interlinked relations with biometric stakeholders. In order to shed light on how such an ontology is useful for BaaS solutions, a case study focusing on the various uses of biometric modalities is presented. The selected use case addresses the asylum seeker or immigrant identification problems regarding the border security challenges where facial biometrics are benefited. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:33","2025-11-10 09:29:33","","510-518","","6","7","","IET Biom.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institution of Engineering and Technology journals@theiet.org","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: A.

The incorporation of heterogeneous resources to traditional homogeneous infrastructures is supported by specific resource managers cohabiting with traditional resource managers. This blend of resource managers raises interoperability issues in the Cloud management domain as customer services are exposed to disjoint mechanisms and incompatibilities between APIs and interfaces. In addition, deploying and configuring HPC workloads in such environments makes porting HPC applications, from traditional cluster environments to the Cloud, complex and ineffectual. Many efforts have been taken to create solutions and standards for ameliorating interoperability issues in inter-cloud and multi-cloud environments and parallels exist between these efforts and the current drive for the adoption of heterogeneity in the Cloud. The work described in this paper attempts to exploit these parallels; managing interoperability issues in Cloud from a unified perspective. In this paper the mOSAIC ontology, pillar of the IEEE 2302 — Standard for Intercloud Interoperability and Federation, is extended towards creating the CloudLightning Ontology (CL-Ontology), in which the incorporation of heterogeneous resources and HPC environments in the Cloud are considered. To support the CL-Ontology, a generic architecture is presented as a driver to manage heterogeneity in the Cloud and, as a use case example of the proposed architecture, the internal architecture of the CloudLightning system is redesigned and presented to show the feasibility of incorporating a semantic engine to alleviate interoperability issues to facilitate the incorporation of HPC in Cloud. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:33","2025-11-10 09:29:33","","373-384","","","88","","Future Gener Comput Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: G.G.

Much research has been carried out to create cloud service registries to help users select cloud services for eventual consumption, especially within the field of semantic web services. Through analyzing real-world requirements of six use cases we identified a gap in research for user-centric technologies. We fill this gap by creating a business vocabulary reflecting common service selection criteria, defining a textual domain specific language to let any user describe services easily, and implementing a novel brokering and matchmaking component to support users in their selection process. As a combination of those technologies, we create the Open Service Compendium (OSC), a crowd-sourced cloud service registry. Our evaluation activities highlight how these developments solve real-world challenges in diverse near-production settings. All of this implies that a substantial benefit for service registry users can be created by following a simple architecture that is focused on their concrete needs — instead of aiming for highest sophistication and broadest applicability as observed in many of the related works. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","846-867","","","87","","Future Gener Comput Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: M.

To preserve privacy, the datasets are usually encrypted before outsourcing. However, the common practice of encryption makes the effective utilization of the data difficult. For example, it is difficult to search the given keywords in encrypted datasets. Many schemes are proposed to make encrypted data searchable based on keywords. However, keyword-based search schemes ignore the semantic representation information of users' retrieval, and cannot completely meet with users search intention. Therefore, how to design a content-based search scheme and make semantic search more effective and context-aware is a difficult challenge. In this paper, we propose ECSED, a novel semantic search scheme based on the concept hierarchy and the semantic relationship between concepts in the encrypted datasets. ECSED uses two cloud servers. One is used to store the outsourced datasets and return the ranked results to data users. The other one is used to compute the similarity scores between the documents and the query and send the scores to the first server. To further improve the search efficiency, we utilize a tree-based index structure to organize all the document index vectors. We employ the multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data as our basic frame to propose two secure schemes. The experiment results based on the real world datasets show that the scheme is more efficient than previous schemes. We also prove that our schemes are secure under the known ciphertext model and the known background model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","2359-2371","","9","13","","IEEE Trans.

Data classification is a widely used data mining technique for big data analysis. It helps the learners to discover hidden data patterns by training massive data collected from the real world. Because this trained model is the private asset of an entity, it should be protected from all other noncollaborative entities. Therefore, it is essential to take effective measures to preserve the confidential data. The objective of this paper is to preserve the privacy of the confidential data in the cloud environment by introducing the medical data classification method. In view of that, this paper presents a method for medical data classification using a novel ontology and whale optimization-based support vector machine (OW-SVM) approach. Initially, privacy-preserved data are developed adopting Kronecker product bat approach, and then, ontology is built for the feature selection process. Ontology and whale optimization-based support vector machine is then proposed by integrating ontology and whale optimization algorithm into SVM, in which ontology and whale optimization algorithm is used for the feasible selection of kernel parameters. The experiment is done using 3 heart disease datasets, such as Cleveland, Switzerland, and Hungarian. In a comparative analysis, the performance of the OW-SVM approach is compared with that of K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, decision tree, SVM, and OW-SVM, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and fitness, as the evaluation metrics. The OW-SVM approach could achieve maximum performance with accuracy of 83.21%, the sensitivity of 91.49%, specificity of 73%, and fitness of 81.955, outperforming existing comparative techniques. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","","","12","31","","Int J Commun Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd vgorayska@wiley.com Southern Gate Chichester, West Sussex PO19 8SQ","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 49; Correspondence Address: N.P.

Methods: We propose a method called circular resolution that utilizes a combination of semantic annotators to map UMLS concepts to DBpedia resources. A set of annotators annotate definitions of UMLS concepts returning DBpedia resources while another set performs annotation on DBpedia resource abstracts returning UMLS concepts. Our pipeline aligns these 2 sets of annotations to determine appropriate mappings from UMLS to DBpedia. Results: We evaluate our proposed method using structured data from the Wikidata knowledge base as the ground truth, which consists of 4899 already existing UMLS to DBpedia mappings. Our results show an 83% recall with 77% precision-at-one (P@1) in mapping UMLS concepts to DBpedia resources on this testing set. Conclusions: The proposed circular resolution method is a simple yet effective technique for linking UMLS concepts to DBpedia resources.

Searching for SLA templates from the provider's place is considered as a cumbersome process for the consumer. Also, it is not guaranteed that retrieved SLAs always match with the consumer requirements. Hence, semantic search engine platforms for cloud SLA using a novel architecture are introduced here. SLA agreements are crawled from the web and annotation is performed in the agreement terms using SLA ontologies to fasten and improve the accuracy of the search process. In the proposed architecture, 3 ontologies are developed for SaaS, PaaS and IaaS as well as 140 SLA documents are gathered. Results revealed that the search efficacy is almost 90% in finding the desired SLA for the consumer to ease negotiation. Moreover, the performance is compared with similar search engine GoNTogle, and it was observed that proposed model produced good results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","70-98","","3","14","","Int.

This approach could guide cancer management thanks to machine learning application to large-scale data. Aim of the Thyroid CoBRA (Consortium for Brachytherapy Data Analysis) project is to develop a standardized web data collection system, focused on thyroid cancer. The Metabolic Radiotherapy Working Group of Italian Association of Radiation Oncology (AIRO) endorsed the implementation of a consortium directed to thyroid cancer management and data collection. The agreement conditions, the ontology of the collected data and the related software services were defined by a multicentre ad hoc working-group (WG). Six Italian cancer centres were firstly started the project, defined and signed the Thyroid COBRA consortium agreement. Three data set tiers were identified: Registry, Procedures and Research. The COBRA-Storage System (C-SS) appeared to be not time-consuming and to be privacy respecting, as data can be extracted directly from the single centre's storage platforms through a secured connection that ensures reliable encryption of sensible data. Automatic data archiving could be directly performed from Image Hospital Storage System or the Radiotherapy Treatment Planning Systems. The C-SS architecture will allow “Cloud storage way” or “distributed learning” approaches for predictive model definition and further clinical decision support tools development. The development of the Thyroid COBRA data Storage System C-SS through a multicentre consortium approach appeared to be a feasible tool in the setup of complex and privacy saving data sharing system oriented to the management of thyroid cancer and in the near future every cancer type. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","73-78","","","53","","Eur.

Note that the outsourced data may be private and contain sensitive information, such as financial trading files, electronic health records, private secret logs and individual sensitive multimedia data. To minimize the probability of the risk of sensitive data leakage, it is desirable for the data owners to encrypt sensitive data before sending them to cloud. However, it also hinders the usability of outsourced data, such as data retrieval operation. Searchable encryption (SE) technology is an important approach to deal with this problem, which enables the users to search over encrypted data to realize effective data utilization. In searchable encryption schemes, the cloud storage server is assumed honest-but-curious (or say, semi-trusted), who is honest to execute the required storage and retrieval operations, but also curious to discover the plaintext keyword or file of users. The security requirement of SE should guarantee that only authorized users can decrypt encrypted data with decryption keys and then obtain plaintext files. In recent years, diverse SE schemes are proposed, which pay attention to both privacy and practicability of the system. However, most of the existing multi-keyword searchable encryption schemes have neither taken into consideration the location information of the keywords nor measured the similarity of the synonym keywords. At the same time, the search efficiency is low and the index construction time is too long. In this paper, we propose a fast multi-keyword semantic ranked search scheme. Firstly, for the first time, the concept of weighted domain scoring is introduced to searchable encryption to calculate the document relevance scores. The keywords in different domains (title, abstract, etc.) are measured by different weighted domain score. Secondly, the retrieved keywords are semantically expanded to their synonym sets and the semantic similarities of the synonyms are calculated. Combining the semantic similarity, the weighted domain score and the relevance scores, we construct the encrypted document index with higher accuracy. To improve the efficiency of MRSE (multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data), we partition the document index vector into several pieces and generate mark vector according to these pieces. Comparing the document mark vector and the query mark vector, we effectively filter a large number of irrelevant documents. The time for calculating the relevance scores and ranking is greatly reduced. Finally, document index vectors are partitioned into several sub-vectors, which are encrypted by the matrices with smaller dimensions. The method greatly reduces the computation overhead of generating encrypted indices and further improves the system efficiency. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the multi-keyword semantic ranked search with high efficiency. It improves the retrieval efficiency, reduces the encrypted index generation time and returns more accurate ranking results. It also guarantees the privacy and security of data. Both the basic and enhanced schemes proposed in this paper are proved secure in known background model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","1346-1359","","6","41","","Jisuanji Xuebao","云计算中保护数据隐私的快速多关键词语义排序搜索方案","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Science Press","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: J.

To realize innovative value services of 'Internet plus' applications in the context where networking interaction exists everywhere, the supply-demand interaction and its semantic interoperability techniques become the golden key to facilitate on-demand business collaboration, construct 'Supply-Side' services oriented towards software models, and finally resolve the 'Information Islands' crisis of deep Web resources (e.g. services) in Cloud Computing. From the perspective of service-oriented software engineering, this paper explores the nature that Model Driven Architecture (MDA) evolves into Model-interaction Driven Architecture (MiDA), and proposes three core techniques in MiDA, including RGPS requirements metamodel framework, O-RGPS construction metamodel for 'Supply-Side' services, and their international standardization on Metadmodel framework for interpretability, i.e. MFI(O-RGPS). In detail, RGPS requirements metamodel framework intends to characterize diverse and personalized service requirements at different levels of granularity, and then it can support requirements directed interaction between models. O-RGPS construction metamodel can facilitate domain knowledge or topic mining for the subjects of 'Supply-Side' service. In addition, it introduces the semantics enhanced ontology and metamodeling approach to construct an interoperable structure for 'Supply-Side' services, in terms of RGPS annotations, semantic annotations and inherent associations between them. Considering MFI(O-RGPS), it provides a series of standard registration metamodels for different types of models, including ontology, role and goal models, process models, and service models. With these metamodels, semantic interoperation between heterogeneous models can be conducted by sharing registration information in a unified way. Furthermore, this paper reveals two types of relationships between these three core techniques in MiDA. One is the basic relationships derived from the joint action of multiple meaning triangle patterns; the other is the virtual-reality interaction and interoperation between software models. Moreover, the authors conclude that as the evolution of MDA, MiDA is compatible with MDA. In the end, this paper discusses the ISO international standard series named MFI(O-RGPS), which was proposed by the authors and aims at semantic interoperability governance and management of software models. In order to evaluate the interoperability capability of MFI(O-RGPS) standards, this paper takes MFI-5, Metamodel for process model registration, as an example and proposes a method to measure the semantic interoperability capability of MFI-5 for heterogeneous business process models. More specifically, we define the mappings from specified process modeling languages or specifications (e.g. BPEL and EPC) to the metamodel in MFI-5 to register administrative information and selected metadata of process models. Based on these mapping rules, for each specific process modeling language, the proportion of mapped elements in the total number of elements can be used to quantify the interoperability degree of MFI-5 to the process models described with this modeling language. The results suggest that our proposed interoperability theory and method can enhance the innovation and service ability of 'Internet plus' enterprises in cloud computing and big data analysis, and satisfy the requirements for both dynamic business collaboration across enterprises and personalized services recommendation oriented towards multiple tenants. This implies that our method can provide interoperable construction for 'Supply-Side' services to support supply-demand interaction in practice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:34","2025-11-10 09:29:34","","1314-1331","","6","41","","Jisuanji Xuebao","化解""信息孤岛""危机的软件模型按需服务互操作技术","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Science Press","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: K.-Q.

Often, these services appear identical in terms of their functionality though they differ in pricing models, computational power, storage policies and Quality-of-Service parameters making the process of service discovery and selection an intricate task. In the absence of any standard specifications, cloud service providers continue to use their own vocabulary and this further complicates the selection process. Even popular search engines like Google and MSN are not efficient enough to properly identify the most appropriate cloud service that can meet customer requirements. Thus, in the presence of multiple selection parameters and constraints, selecting a required cloud service is a daunting task. In order to address this issue, we work toward developing a reasoning mechanism to optimally resolve the similarities across cloud services by using cloud ontology.

This cloud-based integration poses crucial security issues related to the data protection from unauthorized access to the outsourced data, which calls for a proper access control solution. However, the heterogeneity among the organizations exacerbates this problem, demanding an interoperable authorization scheme, where multiple access control models must co-exist. The current literature is rich of academic solutions and standards to have an interoperable exchange of security policies and definition of authorization rules, but lacks an effective support to let different access control models to fully coexist. Moreover, the possibility of stealing authentication credentials and authorization claims paves the way to conducting masquerading attacks that cannot be treated by traditional static authorization solutions, but more dynamic approaches are needed. Last but not least, the continuous interaction of users with the cloud over the time has the vulnerability of exposing personal information to malicious adversaries and to let them trace the user activities.

If the similarity between dengue infected users can be identified, it can help government’s health agencies to manage the outbreak more effectively. To find similarity between cases affected by Dengue, user’s personal and health information are the two fundamental requirements. Identification of similar symptoms, causes, effects, predictions and treatment procedures, is important. In this paper, an effective framework is proposed which finds similar patients suffering from dengue using keyword aware domain thesaurus and case base reasoning method. This paper focuses on the use of ontology dependent domain thesaurus technique to extract relevant keywords and then build cases with the help of case base reasoning method. Similar cases can be shared with users, nearby hospitals and health organizations to manage the problem more adequately. Two million case bases were generated to test the proposed similarity method. Experimental evaluations of proposed framework resulted in high accuracy and low error rate for finding similar cases of dengue as compared to UPCC and IPCC algorithms.

In this paper, we first define the smart factory as a cloud-assisted and self-organized manufacturing system in which physical entities such as machines, conveyors, and products organize production through intelligent negotiation and the cloud supervises this self-organized process for fault detection and troubleshooting based on data analysis. Then, we propose a scheme to integrate knowledge reasoning and semantic data where the reasoning engine processes the ontology model with real time semantic data coming from the production process.

It is the basis for realizing the information exchange in the intelligent cloud-computing environment. This paper proposes a natural language semantic construction method based on cloud database, mainly including two parts: natural language cloud database construction and natural language semantic construction. Natural Language cloud database is established on the CloudStack cloud-computing environment, which is composed by corpus, thesaurus, word vector library and ontology knowledge base. In this section, we concentrate on the pretreatment of corpus and the presentation of background knowledge ontology, and then put forward a TF-IDF and word vector distance based algorithm for duplicated webpages (TWDW). It raises the recognition efficiency of repeated web pages. The part of natural language semantic construction mainly introduces the dynamic process of semantic construction and proposes a mapping algorithm based on semantic similarity (MBSS), which is a bridge between Predicate-Argument (PA) structure and background knowledge ontology. Experiments show that compared with the relevant algorithms, the precision and recall of both algorithms we propose have been significantly improved.

It can conduct search functions over encrypted cloud data and protect the data privacy meanwhile. There are many searchable encryption schemes that support basic search functions like single keyword search, multi-keyword search, similiarity search and so on. To enrich the search functionality, several searchable encryption schemes that support semantic search have been proposed recently. However, these schemes only focus on the existence of keywords during the search process. They have not considered the semantic relation between keywords, which have significant influence on the search results. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a new co-occurrence matrix based Semantic Multi-keyword Ranked Search scheme (SMRS) which considers both the semantic relation of keywords and keyword weight for more accurate search results over encrypted cloud data. We design a term co-occurrence matrix to quantize the semantic correlation of keywords and adopt the widely-used TF-IDF rule to measure the keyword weight. In particular, our scheme can effectively retrieve data items that match the users’ intention better. The indexes and queries are encrypted by the secure kNN algorithm. We also add some randomness in the encryption process for stronger protection. Security analysis prove that SMRS is secure under the known background model. The performance evaluation shows that our scheme achieves high search accuracy and practical search efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:35","2025-11-10 09:29:35","","36-49","","","11063 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

More technically, this concern is related to the classical data integration problem, i.e. how to universally map information from heterogeneous data sources. Adoption of CM may become possible if collaborative agents can automatically discover a set of suitable CM services, and invoke them in a particular order to achieve a certain manufacturing task. Cloud computing community suggested semantic web services in order to enable automatic discovery, invocation and orchestration of web services. In this paper, we describe a novel multi-agent framework, where agents are configured based on Belief, Desire, and Intention (BDI) formalism. In this proposed framework, agents are capable of autonomously discovering and orchestrating manufacturing services based on their intrinsic and extrinsic awareness of the manufacturing knowledge at its most contemporary state. The internal structure of agents are constructed by Horn-DL rules, arguing such DL-safe rules will be able to extract and analyze manufacturing knowledge bases, built with OWL-DL. This chapter also introduces a novel method of selecting suitable services, from the intrinsic semantic in Horn-DL rule.

Beside the traditional hypervisor-based virtualization, another concept co-exists – container-based virtualization. In container-based virtualization, the virtualization layer runs as an application within the operating system, which is much lighter compared to hypervisor. However, in recent times, there is also tendency to apply a virtualization approach of network resources, due to growth of quantity of data that has to be transmitted and increasing number of mobile and wearable devices, which requires more robust and flexible network management. In networking, two important new concepts have emerged: Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). Both of them enable novel ways of design, implementation, configuration and management of computer networks and show potential of network performance improvement and cost reduction in previously mentioned conditions. In this paper, we focus on Network Functions Virtualization and present a model-driven, semantics-enabled framework for automated, (re-)deployment of containerized Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and generation of SDN OpenFlow and network overlay rules as a result. We decide to use container-based virtualization approach in order to decrease the overhead induced by the hypervisor layer, speed-up the deployment and increase the overall flexibility which is crucial in many novel use cases, especially when it comes to Edge Computing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:35","2025-11-10 09:29:35","","90-100","","","","","","","","","","","IADIS Press","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

It is a methodology to efficiently manage the relationship between development and operations in order to automate applications lifecycle. Spurred by its popularity, it is used today to manage applications in the PaaS level of the Cloud. However, it becomes very challenging when it comes to deploying an application in multi-PaaS environments. The first challenge is to discover and select services taking into account the application requirements and on the PaaS capabilities. Indeed, PaaS providers do not use the same mechanisms to describe and expose their services. Added to that, there is no standard way to describe application requirements. To tackle these anomalies, we propose an automatic and declarative approach to discover and select services offered by PaaS providers. It enables developers to express their requirements and PaaS providers to expose their offers in manifests. To do so, a matching algorithm selects the most appropriate offer in terms of PaaS capabilities to deploy the application. An offer may involve either a single or multi-PaaS provider(s). The key ingredients of our solution are threefold: (1) manifests to describe application requirements and the offers, (2) an ontology to remove semantic ambiguities in PaaS providers capabilities, and (3) a matching algorithm to elect the most appropriate offer to the application.The solution is proposed as a REST API and is delivered with a Web client. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:35","2025-11-10 09:29:35","","182-190","","","","","","","","","","","SciTePress","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: WEBIST - Proc.

Several tools for the design and execution of business processes have been proposed, together with standards for their formal representation, such as BPMN. Despite the expressivity of such tools and representations, there is still a lack of integration with cloud services, mostly due to the high variety of currently available offers, which creates confusion among customers. Moreover, portability and interoperability issues tend to hinder the adoption of cloud solutions for the immediate deployment of business processes. In order to overcome such issues and support the adoption of cloud services for the deployment of business processes, in this paper, a semantic approach is proposed.

Benchmarking and simulation are two techniques that have long been practiced towards reliable estimation. Benchmarking involves (potentially) high cost and time consumption, but oftentimes yields more reliable estimates than simulation, while the simulation is much cheaper and faster than benchmarking, but less reliable. In order to deal with this dichotomy, we propose a complementary approach to estimating the performance of Cloud-based systems, whereby performance estimates can be obtained in a fast, inexpensive, and also reliable way. In this approach, the ontological concepts of a benchmark model, whose benchmark results have already been obtained, are mapped into those of a simulation model, while the mismatches and similarities between the two models are taken care of, through measures of similarity between the two. This ontology-driven construction of simulation models is intended not only to yield more reliable simulation results but also to help better explain why the simulation results may, or may not, be reliable. To validate our complementary approach, simulation models are constructed using CloudSim, and the simulation results are compared against the corresponding benchmark results, by using our prototype tool, collected from Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Compute Engine (GCE) by using the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) tool. These experiments show that the simulation results show about 90% accuracy with respect to the benchmark results, and additionally we feel we could better explain why this happens. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:35","2025-11-10 09:29:35","","576-591","","","11236 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

It plays a vital role in understanding user context in order to determine patients' safety, situation identification accuracy, and provide personalized comfort. The smart health domain contains a huge number of different types of context profiles related to interactive devices, linked health objects, and smart-home. The key role of context profiles is to deduce urgent situations that are needed to run adaptation components on a specific smarthealth Fog. Existing platforms and middlewares lack support to efficiently analyze a large number of heterogeneous specific profiles and continuous context changing in near real time. In this paper, we focus on data and dissemination of information from services related to the field of e-health. This paper aims to provide a new generic user situation-aware profile ontology (GUSP-Onto) for a semantic description of heterogeneous users' profiles with efficient patients' situation management and health multimedia information dissemination related to smart health services. Based on the users' situation management ontology, a two-layered architecture was proposed. The first layer is used to achieve a quality diagnosis of urgent situations including a smart fog computing enhanced with semantic profile modeling that offers efficient situation management. The second layer allows a more in-depth situation analysis for patients and enhanced rich services using cloud computing that provides good scalability. The most innovative of this architecture is the potential benefits from the semantic representation to conduct emergency situation knowledge reasoning and ultimately realize early service selection and adaptation process. The experimental results show a decreased time response and an enhanced accuracy of the proposed approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:35","2025-11-10 09:29:35","","537-567","","4","17","","J.

In this paradigm, there are many cloud service providers involved to offer different level of services and the effectiveness of the service specification, identification of services is always a challenging one. Hence, we propose a broker based cloud computing framework for enabling the cloud user to specify their service requirements in terms of numerical representation. The infrastructure type of services such as computing and storage are considered for this proposal. With respect to the user specification, the proposed broker constructs the cloud ontology to represent the available services from the service repository. With the aid of ontological representation, the proposed broker discovers the infrastructure services from the available vendor.

Efficient text mining of such maintenance data plays an important role in discovering the best-practice repair knowledge from millions of repair verbatims, which help to conduct accurate fault diagnosis and predication. This paper presents a text case-based reasoning framework by cloud computing, which uses the diagnosis ontology for annotating fault features recorded in the repair verbatim. The extracted fault features are further reduced by rough set theory. Finally, the case retrieval is employed to search the best-practice repair actions for fixing faulty parts. By cloud computing, rough set-based attribute reduction and case retrieval are able to scale up the Big Data records and improve the efficiency of fault diagnosis and predication.

As such, it can really support performing different kinds of analysis tasks over business process (BP) execution related information. When moving BPs in the cloud, giving rise to Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) concept, the first main challenge is to collect and link, based on a certain structure, information originating from different systems. To this end, two main ontologies are proposed in this paper to enable this structuring: a KPI and a Dependency one. Then, via exploiting these well-connected ontologies, an innovative Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis system is built that offers two main analysis capabilities: KPI assessment and drill-down, where the second can enable finding root causes of KPI violations. This system advances the state-of-the-art by exhibiting the capability, through the LD usage, of the flexible construction and assessment of any KPI kind, allowing experts to better explore the possible KPI space. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:35","2025-11-10 09:29:35","","237-261","","","864","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

Currently, the performance of information system is considered a problem, we must intervene to make them more agile and responsive to better support the strategy of the company. The exchange and communication is a must between information systems to address these issues and new requirements, businesses are looking to integrate and interact even their information systems to interconnect applications. Interoperability is essential between information systems, it promotes alignment between the company's business strategy and IT strategy while respecting the existing technical heritage of the company. The interoperability solutions between information systems face major problems since the SI is independently developed and designed differently and that solutions must meet certain criteria, namely, autonomy, scalability and resolve trade problems of data. The MDA approach is the most suitable solution to our problem because it ensures a degree of independence between the logic the company's business and technology platform. Moreover, oriented architecture SOA service is used in this sense, it encapsulates the components of the information system into editable and reusable service. We want through this article to contribute to the development of a model for interoperability of several different IS, founded on a middleware layer compound of services according to the architecture SOA. The special feature of our model is that it uses an ontological database in the Cloud that will store concepts exchanged among interconnected IS and uses several transformation layers, integration, homogenization and adapting services. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:35","2025-11-10 09:29:35","","230-235","","4","9","","Intl.

As an emerging novel technical paradigm, cloud computing is becoming an efficient mechanism that has been broadly implemented in multiple fields with using Internet-enabled devices. Telehealth system is one of the crucial domains in applications of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), which is also considered an important component in smart city. However, Personalized Cloud-based Telehealth (PCTH) is still facing a great challenge due to restrictions deriving from various perspectives, such as cloud resource allocations and real-time information transfers. This paper concentrates on the issue of optimizing the performance of the resource allocation for achieving smart tele-health with obtaining and analyzing real-time data within the dynamic application environment in cloud computing. The dynamic data environment is mainly associated with social connections generated by physicians or health organizations. Along with this focus, we propose a novel approach, entitled Smart Cloud-based Telehealth Cyber Physical Social Systems (SCT-CPSS), to enable mobile CPSS to offer users a real-time health information service based on the social networking behaviors and inputs. Main algorithms used in this proposed mechanism include Real-Time Matching with Dynamic Programming Algorithm (RTM-DPA) and Monte Carlo-based Real-Time Analysis Algorithm (MC-RTAA).

A growing number of pay-peruse cloud services are now available on the web in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). With the increase in the number of services, there has also been an increase in demand and adoption of cloud services making cloud service identification and discovery a challenging task. This is due to varied service, descriptions, non-standardised naming conventions, heterogeneity in type and features of cloud services. Thus, selecting an appropriate cloud service according to consumer requirements is a daunting task, especially for applications that use a composition of different cloud services. In this paper, we have designed an ontology-based cloud infrastructure service discovery and selection system that defines functional and non-functional concepts, attributes and relations of infrastructure services. We have shown how the system enables one to discover appropriate services optimally as requested by consumers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:35","2025-11-10 09:29:35","","108-119","","2","9","","Int.

This API allows objects and collections of objects to be stored and retrieved uniformly across a range of cloud-based storage providers. This in turn realizes improved portability and easy migration of software systems between providers and services. Our multi-cloud storage abstraction is implemented as a Java-based multi-cloud storage API and supports a range of storage providers including GoogleDrive, DropBox, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services as sample service providers. We focus on the architectural aspects of the broker in this paper. The abstraction provided by the broker is based on a layered ontological framework. While many multi-cloud applications exist, we investigate in more detail the mapping of the layered ontology onto a design pattern-based organisation of the architecture.

SMEs are reluctant to enter the growing PaaS market due to the possibility of being locked in to a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants. The PaaSport Marketplace aims to avoid the provider lock-in problem by allowing Platform provider SMEs to roll out semantically interoperable PaaS offerings and Software SMEs to deploy or migrate their applications on the best-matching offering, through a thin, non-intrusive Cloud broker. In this paper, we present the PaaSport semantic model, namely an OWL ontology, extension of the DUL ontology. The ontology is used for semantically representing (a) PaaS offering capabilities and (b) requirements of applications to be deployed. The ontology has been designed to optimally support a semantic matchmaking and ranking algorithm that recommends the best-matching PaaS offering to the application developer. The DUL ontology offers seamless extensibility, since both PaaS Characteristics and parameters are defined as classes; therefore, extending the ontology with new characteristics and parameters requires the addition of new specialized subclasses of the already existing classes, which is less complicated than adding ontology properties. The PaaSport ontology is evaluated through verification tools, competency questions, human experts, application tasks and query performance tests. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:36","2025-11-10 09:29:36","","81-115","","","113","","Data Knowl Eng","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: N.

In the last decade number of cloud-based services has grown intensely and rapidly. The diversification of cloud service providers has generated the diversification of their offers. Therefore, end-users face a huge challenge while choosing the appropriate cloud provider. Furthermore, the battle for dominance between the big vendors, like Amazon, Google and Salesforce, makes them reluctant to agree on widely accepted standards promoting their own incompatible formats, thus increases the lock-in effect and affects the competition. Interoperability is the missing element that will recover this situation and allows switch between cloud providers whenever needed without setting data and applications at risk. In this paper, we present an approach that will help strengthen semantic and technical interoperability of services. The approach presents a Cloud Community that acts as a broker to mediate between service providers and service consumers based on web ontology language OWLS. This concept would enable end users to select the right services and compose services across multiple Clouds. It would, also, to provide cloud arbitration services that allow users to shift and to choose between existing platforms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2018","2025-11-10 09:29:36","2025-11-10 09:29:36","","222-231","","","639","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Adv.

Yet, the shared and on-demand nature of the cloud paradigm introduces a new breed of security threats that generally deter stakeholders from relinquishing control of their critical assets to third-party cloud providers. One way to thwart these threats is to instill suitable access control policies into cloud services that protect these assets. Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of cloud environments calls for policies that are able to incorporate a potentially complex body of contextual knowledge. This complexity is further amplified by the interplay that inevitably occurs between the different policies, as well as by the dynamically-evolving nature of an organisation’s business and security needs. We argue that one way to tame this complexity is to devise a generic framework that facilitates the governance of policies. This paper presents a particular aspect of such a framework, namely an approach to determining the repercussions that policy retirement actions have on the overall protection of critical assets in the cloud. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:36","2025-11-10 09:29:36","","21-28","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: UCC Companion - Companion Proc.

By relying on an ontology-based representation of policies and services, the SC3 achieves a proper separation of concerns between policy definition and policy enforcement.

In addition, such keywords may have a certain grammatical relationship among them, which reflect the importance of keywords from the user's perspective intuitively. However, the existing search techniques regard the search keywords as independent and unrelated. In this paper, for the first time, we take the relation among query keywords into consideration and design a keyword weighting algorithm to show the importance of the distinction among them. By introducing the keyword weight to the search protocol design, the search results will be more in line with the user's demand. On top of this, we further design a novel central keyword semantic extension ranked scheme. By extending the central query keyword instead of all keywords, our scheme makes a good tradeoff between the search functionality and efficiency. To better express the relevance between queries and files, we further introduce the TF-IDF rule when building trapdoors and the index. In particular, our scheme supports both data set and keywords updates by using the sub-matrix technique. Our work first gives a basic idea for the design of the central keyword semantic extension ranked scheme, and then presents two secure searchable encryption schemes to meet different privacy requirements under two different threat models. Experiments on the real-world data set show that our proposed schemes are efficient, effective, and secure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:36","2025-11-10 09:29:36","","2986-2997","","12","12","","IEEE Trans.

Traditional resource service models focus on modeling the attributes, interfaces, and descriptions of the resources into resource information services. Such resource services are suitable for local environment but suffer semantic heterogeneities in open cloud environment. Recently, well-designed ontologies are applied in resource service models to unify the schema and eliminate the semantic heterogeneities among the services. However, the effectiveness of ontology-based models mainly depends on the expertise of the ontology experts in ontology designing. Moreover, it is difficult to catch the dynamic changes in the cloud once the ontology has been embedded. In this paper, a semantic model is presented for information resource service modeling that uses semantic links instead of ontologies. The model takes advantage of semantic links to enable automated integrating and distributed updating in resource service cloud. In the experiment, the model is applied on practical manufacturing resources from a wheel manufacturing company. The case study and experimental results show that the proposed model is suitable for modeling manufacturing resources into cloud services and enables the flexible and distributed manipulation on resource services in the cloud environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:36","2025-11-10 09:29:36","","3338-3349","","6","13","","IEEE Trans.

Discovering of the appropriate resources or services is a major challenge in the cloud computing. Therefore, many methods are proposed to tackle this problem. Also, in the cloud environments, ontology is a description of the concepts and relationships that can exist for a cloud service or group of services. On the other hand, for a certain item, user's interest according to the information of their profiles are predicted by collaborative filtering. It uses a collection of users with similar interests to predict interesting information for target users. However, despite the importance of the semantic relations among the cloud services, a few papers consider these relations to discover the proper resources. Therefore, this paper aims at proposing a method to discover the cloud services via semantic concepts and collaborative filtering.

Typically, cloud providers advertise cloud service descriptions in various formats on the Internet. On the other hand, cloud consumers use available search engines (Google and Yahoo) to explore cloud service descriptions and find the adequate service. Unfortunately, general purpose search engines are not designed to provide a small and complete set of results, which makes the process a big challenge. This paper presents a generic-distrusted framework for cloud services marketplace to automate cloud services discovery and selection process, and remove the barriers between service providers and consumers. Additionally, this work implements two instances of generic framework by adopting two different matching algorithms; namely dominant and recessive attributes algorithm borrowed from gene science and semantic similarity algorithm based on unified cloud service ontology. Finally, this paper presents unified cloud services ontology and models the real-life cloud services according to the proposed ontology. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a cloud services marketplace where cloud providers and cloud consumers can trend cloud services as utilities. In comparison with existing work, semantic approach reduced the execution time by 20% and maintained the same values for all other parameters. On the other hand, dominant and recessive attributes approach reduced the execution time by 57% but showed lower value for recall. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:36","2025-11-10 09:29:36","","569-576","","6","8","","J.

This paper presents a workflow-net-based mechanism for mobile edge node cooperation in fog-cloud networks to form guaranteed SSOs. The proposed solution uses a mathematical cooperation operator to turn the SSO composition problem expressed as workflow nets into algebraic representations. In turn, the minimal cost cooperative path from the workflow net is determined such that it guarantees the delivery of the requested composite media services to clients.

In this paper, we propose a novel semantic keyword searchable proxy re-encryption scheme for secure cloud storage. A highlight of this work is that the scheme is quantum attack resistant, while most of the available searchable encryption schemes are not. It supports not only exact keyword search but also synonym keyword search. Moreover, the data owner is capable to delegate his search right to another user using the proxy re-encryption mechanism. In the generation process of re-encryption key, the delegator and delegatee do not need to be interactive with each other. The scheme is also collusion resistant.

However, each cloud provider uses its own techniques (languages, standards, ontologies, or models, etc.) to describe cloud services. The diversity of these techniques leads to the vendor lock-in problem, and thus, the lack of a cloud service description standardization. In addition, existing service descriptions cover only particular aspects and neglect others. For example, WSDL covers only technical aspect and does not cover business and semantic ones. Our objective is to define a standardized cloud service description that covers technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. In this paper, we introduce different approaches that have dealt with cloud service description, and thus, we adopt USDL language as an appropriate technique to describe cloud services thanks to its expressivity by covering three perspectives (technical, operational, and business). But, USDL is still limited because it cannot cover semantic aspect and it is not intended for cloud computing domain. After that, we highlight USDL limitations that can appear in cloud computing domain and that should be taken into consideration in our research work. This paper will focus on establishing a WSMO-based ontology to define semantically cloud services. This new cloud service description is based on USDL and we will enhance it by taking into consideration some USDL limitations. Finally, we test our proposed cloud service description model on a case study to prove its applicability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:36","2025-11-10 09:29:36","","1-20","","","132","","J Syst Software","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: S.

This is usually done by addition of newer hardware, whose configuration might differ from the existing nodes. As a result, clusters are becoming heterogeneous in nature. For many real world machine learning and data mining applications, data is represented in the form of graphs. Most of the existing distributed graph processing frameworks such as Pregel and Graphlab assume that the computational nodes are homogeneous. These frameworks split the graph into approximately equal subgraphs, which is appropriate for homogeneous clusters. In heterogeneous clusters, these frameworks perform poorly in most of the scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, GraphIVE is the only heterogeneity-aware graph processing framework. It learns the relative capabilities of the nodes based on runtime metrics of previous jobs and partitions the graph proportionally. However, it may not perform well if a new job differs drastically in terms of resource requirements when compared to previous jobs executed on the cluster. To overcome this limitation, we propose GraphSteal, a dynamic graph re-partitioning policy for vertex-cut based graph processing frameworks on heterogeneous clusters. GraphSteal dynamically re-partitions the graph based on the runtime characteristics of the job. To avoid computational skew in the cluster, it migrates edges from slow nodes to fast nodes. To demonstrate our approach, we modify the source code of Graphlab to incorporate dynamic graph re-partitioning strategy.

Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:36:15","","482-494","","Specialissue","2017","","Int.

However, most existing efficient and reliable ciphertext search schemes are based on keywords or shallow semantic parsing, which are not smart enough to meet with users' search intention. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a content-aware search scheme, which can make semantic search more smart. First, we introduce conceptual graphs (CGs) as a knowledge representation tool. Then, we present our two schemes (PRSCG and PRSCG-TF) based on CGs according to different scenarios. In order to conduct numerical calculation, we transfer original CGs into their linear form with some modification and map them to numerical vectors. Second, we employ the technology of multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data as the basis against two threat models and raise PRSCG and PRSCG-TF to resolve the problem of privacy-preserving smart semantic search based on CGs. Finally, we choose a real-world data set: CNN data set to test our scheme. We also analyze the privacy and efficiency of proposed schemes in detail.

This situation is due to the high number of cloud services currently available on the market, which either expose non-standard interfaces or implement different standards, according to their specific objective. As in the past design patterns have been applied to software design to bring order and help developers in better building, composing and reusing their application, nowadays cloud patterns offer the opportunity to leverage best practices in services composition to ease the design and deployment of cloud-oriented applications. However, due to differences in semantics which affect services’, operations’ and parameters’ descriptions, cloud patterns alone cannot solve the cloud service composition problem. In this paper a methodology for the discovery and composition of cloud services, guided by cloud patterns, is presented. Such a methodology is supported by semantic Web technologies, such as OWL, OWL-S and SPARQL, to solve incongruence between interfaces’ and parameters’ descriptions, and to automatize the whole composition process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","4557-4570","","16","21","","Soft Comput.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Verlag service@springer.de","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 36; Correspondence Address: G.

We need to search and retrieve all the files which are semantically linked to the query in addition to the precise identical file in a secured manner. But for protecting sensitive information like military information, personal health documents etc, these documents have to be shielded before moving to cloud; which prevents conventional search methodologies using plain text keyword search. It is essential to use multi k-words in searching and retrieve the documents based on their significance order of k-word by considering the ever rising number of data possessor and documents in cloud. Meanwhile existing approaches only support fuzzy keyword based search but not semantic based search. There are works based on multi keyword ranked search using synonymous queries but not based on semantics. For securing the data in the cloud, we use (Advanced Encryption Standard) AES algorithm to encrypt the data and (Reverse Advanced Encryption Standard) RAES to decrypt the same. We use secured (k-Nearest Neighbour) KNN algorithm to achieve secured search. In order to provide semantic based search we include a tool called wordnet where we perform semantic based analysis of the files and then include secured KNN over the documents and rank them according to their order of relevance primarily using the term and inverse document frequency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","570-576","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

This makes the Cloud resource scheduling a complex optimization problem. None of existing Cloud systems is both being an automated scheduling and considering the optimal usage of resources. To address above problems, we propose a Cloud computing resource scheduling strategy using improved Semantic Search Engine (ISSE). SSE is a new type of service search engine developed by Semantic Computing laboratory in University of California, Irvine. It provides Cloud users with a friendly problem-driven interface to automatically schedule resources that would be used to build a solution according to users' requirementsin the aid of semantic information from resources and user requirements. Further we adopt improvedgenetic algorithm(IGA) in SSE to optimize the scheduling so as to obtain the optimal usage of resources. In our proposed IGA there should be a code distant between the selected parents to retain the population diversity and obtain the valid solution. The architecture of our proposed ISSE is presented as well as the process and implementation of IGA. The experiment results show our proposed ISSE is feasible and can reduce about 16% average tasks execution time comparing to the traditional Cloud resource scheduling (TCRS). © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","","","","Part F131840","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

Risk identification is the first major step in the risk management process that determines possible risks in a software project and dictates how effective the risk management process will be. However, there are several approaches used to identify risk. The approaches depend on subjective decisions of risk or domain experts which increase cost and workload. Therefore, to make the risk identification more effective, a systematic and automated approach is necessary. In this paper, we propose an alternative risk identification scheme using knowledgeable ontology representing risk taxonomy and CMMI project planning guideline. The ontology provides the relations among risk factors and software project risks according to the structure of risk taxonomy and the relevant process areas in CMMI.

Thus, a need to organize these services and to express relations between them arises. To answer this need, ontologies are used. To query these services, the authors use query languages, such as SPARQL, that return two types of results: either a list of required services, or an empty list. However, the second result is not desired. In fact, if the required service is not available, users want to be offered by a list of similar ones instead of the empty list. It is in this sense that the similarity, which provides more results ranked according to their utilities, is used. This paper first presents the Cloud ontology on which the authors’ work is based. It then defines and compares between two Cloud service discovery methods which are: the discovery based on query languages and the discovery based on similarity. To show the efficiency of the search based on similarity, the authors propose a search engine that allows the users to query services using a simple to use interface. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","60-78","","3","8","","Int.

Linked data is essentially a very simplistic format for representation of knowledge in that all the knowledge is represented as triples which can be linked using one or more components from the triple. To date, most of the efforts has been towards either creating linked data by mining the web or making it available for users as a source of knowledgebase for knowledge engineering applications. In recent times there has been a growing need for these applications to interact with users in a natural language which required the transformation of the linked data knowledge into a natural language. The aim of the RealText project described in this paper, is to build a scalable framework to transform Linked Data into natural language by generating lexicalization patterns for triples. A lexicalization pattern is a syntactical pattern that will transform a given triple into a syntactically correct natural language sentence. Using DBpedia as the Linked Data resource, we have generated 283 accurate lexicalization patterns for a sample set of 25 ontology classes. We performed human evaluation on a test sub-sample with an inter-rater agreement of 0.86 and 0.80 for readability and accuracy respectively. This results showed that the lexicalization patterns generated language that are accurate, readable and emanates qualities of a human produced language. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","30-35","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

H3ABioNet, a pan-African bioinformatics network, was established to build capacity specifically to enable H3Africa (Human Heredity and Health in Africa) researchers to analyze their data in Africa. Since the inception of the H3Africa initiative, H3ABioNet's role has evolved in response to changing needs from the consortium and the African bioinformatics community. Objectives H3ABioNet set out to develop core bioinformatics infrastructure and capacity for genomics research in various aspects of data collection, transfer, storage, and analysis. Methods and Results Various resources have been developed to address genomic data management and analysis needs of H3Africa researchers and other scientific communities on the continent. NetMap was developed and used to build an accurate picture of network performance within Africa and between Africa and the rest of the world, and Globus Online has been rolled out to facilitate data transfer. A participant recruitment database was developed to monitor participant enrollment, and data is being harmonized through the use of ontologies and controlled vocabularies. The standardized metadata will be integrated to provide a search facility for H3Africa data and biospecimens. Because H3Africa projects are generating large-scale genomic data, facilities for analysis and interpretation are critical. H3ABioNet is implementing several data analysis platforms that provide a large range of bioinformatics tools or workflows, such as Galaxy, the Job Management System, and eBiokits. A set of reproducible, portable, and cloud-scalable pipelines to support the multiple H3Africa data types are also being developed and dockerized to enable execution on multiple computing infrastructures. In addition, new tools have been developed for analysis of the uniquely divergent African data and for downstream interpretation of prioritized variants. To provide support for these and other bioinformatics queries, an online bioinformatics helpdesk backed by broad consortium expertise has been established. Further support is provided by means of various modes of bioinformatics training. Conclusions For the past 4 years, the development of infrastructure support and human capacity through H3ABioNet, have significantly contributed to the establishment of African scientific networks, data analysis facilities, and training programs. Here, we describe the infrastructure and how it has affected genomics and bioinformatics research in Africa. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:37","2025-11-10 09:29:37","","91-98","","2","12","","Glo.

First, we utilize AHP to establish vulnerability severity multi-level index system. Then, the cloud theory is used to set up the remark set cloud, the scale set cloud and the membership function cloud to respectively confirm the quantification cloud graph of remark set, factor weights and membership fuzzy matrix. Combining with vulnerability ontology value and vulnerability correlation value, we can achieve the evaluation of vulnerability severity.

In a previous work, the authors proposed a class of models, the Unary Resource Description Framework Petri Nets (U-RDF-PN), which integrated Petri nets and (RDF-based) semantic information. The work also proposed a model checking approach for the analysis of system behavioural properties that made use of the net reachability graph. Computing such a graph, specially when dealing with high-level structures as RDF graphs, is a very expensive task that must be considered. This paper describes the development of a parallel solution for the computation of the reachability graph of U-RDF-PN models. Besides that, the paper presents some experimental results when the tool was deployed in cluster and cloud frameworks. The results not only show the improvement in the total time required for computing the graph, but also the high scalability of the solution, which make it very useful thanks to the current (and future) availability of cloud infrastructures.

The reference architecture has been designed by leveraging information structuring approaches and by using well-known architecture design principles and patterns. The RA has been documented using view-based approach and has been presented in terms of its context, goals, the RA meta-model, information structuring and relationship models using ontologies and components of the RA. We have demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the RA with the help of a prototype and have used the prototype to provision software architecting tools. We have also evaluated the RA in terms of effectiveness of the design decisions and the RA's completeness and feasibility using scenario-based architecture evaluation method.

To assess the energy efficiency of DC operation, we have defined a novel ontological model for representing its energy and performance characteristics and a new metric for aggregating Green and Key Performance Indicators and calculating at run-time the DC Greenness Level. Workload balancing and consolidation is achieved by means of an automated reinforcement learning-based decision process targeting to increase the workload density and to scale down the unused computing resources. Evaluation results show that up to 15.6 % energy savings are obtained on our test bed DC. Tests conducted in a simulated environment show that the time and space overhead of our methodology are within reasonable limits and that by organizing the servers in hierarchical clusters, the methodology can manage highly dynamic workload in large DCs with thousands of servers.

One of the key issues is to model the SoS requirements and automate the verification procedure. To solve the problem of modeling and verification, meta-models are proposed to refine both functional and non-functional characteristics of the SoS requirements. A domain-specific modeling language is defined by extending Unified Modeling Language (UML) class and association with fuzzy constructs to model the vague and uncertain concepts of the SoS quality requirements. The efficiency evaluation function of the cloud model is introduced to evaluate the efficiency of the SoS quality requirements. Then a concise algorithm transforms the fuzzy UML models into the description logic (DL) ontology so that the verification can be automated with a DL reasoner. This method implements modeling and verification of high-level SoS quality requirements. A crisp case is used to facilitate and demonstrate the correctness and feasibility of this method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:38","2025-11-10 09:29:38","","346-361","","3","18","","Front.

Furthermore, the modules of the framework, which are Cloud Storage and Multiple Tenants Access Control Layer, Healthcare Data Annotation Layer, and Healthcare Data Analysis Layer, are discussed. In the data storage layer, a multiple tenant access method is designed to protect patient privacy. In the data annotation layer, linked open data are adopted to augment health data interoperability semantically. In the data analysis layer, the process mining algorithm and similarity calculating method are implemented to support personalised treatment plan selection.

In an effort to standardize cloud service descriptions, several works propose to use ontologies. Nevertheless, the adoption of any of the proposed ontologies calls for an evaluation to show its efficiency in cloud service discovery. Indeed, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services by proposing ontologies. Since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology (CSO), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. To this end, this paper has a three-fold contribution. First, we specify a set of patterns and anti-patterns in order to evaluate our CSO. Second, we define an anti-pattern detection algorithm based on SPARQL queries which provides a set of correction recommendations to help ontologists revise their ontology. Finally, tests were conducted in relation to: (i) the algorithm efficiency and (ii) anti-pattern detection of design anomalies as well as taxonomic and domain errors within CSO. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:38","2025-11-10 09:29:38","","4231-4240","","","2017-January","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Pharmacovigilance methods are used to detect unanticipated DDIs and ADRs by mining Spontaneous Reporting Systems, such as the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). However, these methods do not provide mechanistic explanations for the discovered drug-ADR associations in a systematic manner. In this paper, we present a systems pharmacology-based approach to perform mechanism-based pharmacovigilance. We integrate data and knowledge from four different sources using Semantic Web Technologies and Linked Data principles to generate a systems network. We present a network-based Apriori algorithm for association mining in FAERS reports. We evaluate our method against existing pharmacovigilance methods for three different validation sets. Our method has AUROC statistics of 0.7-0.8, similar to current methods, and event-specific thresholds generate AUROC statistics greater than 0.75 for certain ADRs.

It consists of a generic data model and a series of corresponding generic services, e.g. for the provision of master data, metrics, spatial data, digital assets, metadata, and links between them. The main objectives are the efficient provision of data as well as the use of the same data by a wide range of applications. In addition, the used technologies and services should enable data supplyasopen (government) data or as linked data in the sense of the Semantic Web. In a first version, these services are used exclusively for read access to the data. For this purpose, the data are usually extracted from their original systems, possibly processed and then stored redundantly in powerful backend systems (“Web Cache”). Generic microservices provide uniform REST interfaces to access the data. Each service can use different backend systems connected via adapters. In this way, consuming components such as frontend modules in a Web portal can transparently access various backend systems via stable interfaces, which can therefore be selected optimally for each application. A number of tools and workflows ensure the updating and consistency of the data in the Web Cache. Microservices and backend systems are operated on the basis of container virtualization using flexible cloud infrastructures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:38","2025-11-10 09:29:38","","360-371","","","507","","","","","","","","Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.

In this paper, we propose SSLAC, where we combine the capabilities of two prominent service specification and SLA languages: OWL-Q and SLAC. These languages have different scopes but complementary features. SLAC is domain specific with validation and verification capabilities. OWL-Q is a higher level language based on ontologies and well defined semantics. Their combination advances the state of the art in many perspectives. It enables the SLA's semantic verification and inference and, at the same time, its constraint-based modelling and enforcement. It also provides a complete formal approach for defining non-functional terms and an enforcement framework covering real-world scenarios.

Currently, there exist many discovery schemes that separately handle such discovery tasks. When a company needs to build a discovery service, it manually selects the suitable discovery schemes, encapsulates them as services, then invokes them as a composite web service. However, when different discovery tasks/schemes are needed, such composite discovery service needs to be manually reconfigured, and different versions of the discovery service are created and managed. To overcome such problems, we propose to build a dynamic self-configuring discovery service (i.e., DISCO), that takes the required discovery policy from users, then automatically finds the suitable discovery schemes in a context-sensitive manner, and finally arranges them as a collection of executable BPEL processes. This is done by adopting different types of knowledge regarding the services' aspects, discovery schemes, and the adopted software ontologies. Such different knowledge types are captured and managed by the previously proposed JAMEJAM framework. Experimental results show that DISCO successfully managed to reconfigure itself for different discovery policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","307-314","","","","","","","","","","","SciTePress","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CLOSER - Proc.

The respective technology can also be exploited to perform inferencing for deriving added-value knowledge. As such, LD technology can really assist in performing various analysis tasks over information related to business process execution. In the context of Business Process as a Service (BPaaS), the first real challenge is to collect and link information originating from different systems by following a certain structure. As such, this paper proposes two main ontologies that serve this purpose: A KPI and a Dependency one. Based on these well-connected ontologies, an innovative Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis system is then built which exhibits two main analysis capabilities: KPI assessment and drill-down, where the second can be exploited to find root causes of KPI violations. Compared to other KPI analysis systems, LD usage enables the flexible construction and assessment of any KPI kind allowing experts to better explore the possible KPI space. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","63-74","","","","","","","","","","","SciTePress","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CLOSER - Proc.

This paper focuses on the semantic discovery of N2Sky services through a human-centered querying mechanism termed as N2Query. N2Query allows N2Sky users to specify their problem statement as natural language queries. In response to the natural language queries, it delivers a list of ranked neural network services to the user as a solution to their stated problem.

The use of new technologies allowing it to reach a far greater level of effectiveness: the audience can join in the storytelling process, thus impacting positively on engagement and facilitating the development of long lasting relationships. Our contribution is a revisited digital storytelling approach to discovery cultural heritage and tourism. Some of the benefits which digital storytelling brings to the tourism industry are that it enriches tourist destinations and attractions, it preserves and explores local culture and it shows the authentic experience of cultural tourism. Furthermore, digital storytelling develops cross-cultural understanding. In particular, we have chosen to employ an ontological model in order to realize a dynamic digital storytelling system, able to collect and elaborate social information and contents about the users giving them a personalized story based on the place they are visiting.

This issue calls for two requirements to be satisfied. First, data should be handled in accordance with both owners’ preferences and regulations policies whenever it exists in the cloud and throughout its lifetime. Second, a consistent data flow tracking should be maintained to follow up the data derivation. Toward addressing these issues, we propose in this paper a hybrid approach to protect private data in the cloud. We propose the PriArmor data content for self-defending data when stored or transferred in the cloud and the PriArmor agent that acts as an armor for its privacy protection when processed by the cloud-based services. To facilitate the policy specification, we propose a novel privacy ontology model that drives the data owner to express his privacy requirements and to consider the regulations policies. Finally, we present the implementation details as well as a demonstration that shows flexibility and efficiency of our approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","23-37","","","10232 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Taking into consideration that most of the “killer” applications require a graph-based representation (e.g., the Web, social network management, protein-protein interaction networks), efficient query processing and analysis techniques are required, not only because these graphs are massive but also because the operations that must be supported are complex, requiring significant computational resources. In many cases, each graph edge e is annotated by a probability value p(e), expressing its existential uncertainty. This means that with probability p(e) the edge will be present in the graph and with probability 1 − p(e) the edge will be absent. This gives rise to the concept of probabilistic graphs (also known as uncertain graphs). Formally, a probabilistic graph G is a triplet (V, E, p) where V is the set of nodes, E is the set of edges and p: E → (0, 1]. The main challenge posed by this formulation is that problems that are relatively easy to solve in exact graphs become very difficult (or even intractable) in probabilistic graphs. In this paper, we perform an overview of the algorithmic techniques proposed in the literature for uncertain graph analysis. In particular, we center our focus on the following graph mining tasks: clustering, maximal cliques, k-nearest neighbors and core decomposition. We conclude the paper with a short discussion related to distributed mining of uncertain graphs which is expected to achieve significant performance improvements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","87-116","","","10230 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Annotation results are difficult to reproduce across study sites due to shifting software versions and a lack of a unified hardware interface between study sites. Cloud computing offers a promising solution by integrating hardware and software into reproducible virtual appliances which may be utilized on-demand and shared across institutions. We developed ENSEMBL VEP on EC2 (EVE), a cloud-based virtual appliance for annotation of human genetic variants built around the ENSEMBL Variant Effect Predictor. We integrated virtual hardware infrastructure, opensource software, and publicly available genomic datasets to provide annotation capability for genetic variants in the context of genes/transcripts, Gene Ontology pathways, tissue-specific expression from the Gene Expression Atlas, miRNA annotations, minor allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Exome Aggregation Consortium, and deleteriousness scores from Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion. We demonstrate the utility of EVE by annotating the genetic variants in a case-control study of glaucoma. Cloud computing can reduce the difficulty of replicating complex software pipelines such as annotation pipelines across study sites. We provide a publicly available CloudFormation template of the EVE virtual appliance which can automatically provision and deploy a parameterized, preconfigured hardware/software stack ready for annotation of human genetic variants (github.com/epistasislab/EVE). This approach offers increased reproducibility in human genetic studies by providing a unified appliance to researchers across the world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","83-95","","","10199 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a context-aware system for the SLA in order to guarantee the QoS. We create a contextual ontology to introduce the semantic meaning of the cloud consumer contextual parameters. In addition, using reasoning techniques, we (1) predict SLA violations and we (2) choose and apply the corrective actions in autonomous manner.

This paper presents the railway power consumption simulator model (RPCS), a cloud-based model for the design, simulation and evaluation of railway electric infrastructures. This model integrates the parameters of an infrastructure within a search engine that generates and evaluates a set of simulations to achieve optimal designs, according to a given set of objectives and restrictions. The knowledge of the domain is represented as an ontology that translates the elements in the infrastructure into an electric circuit, which is simulated to obtain a wide range of electric metrics. In order to support the execution of thousands of scenarios in a scalable, efficient and fault-tolerant manner, this paper introduces an architecture to deploy the model in a cloud environment, and a dimensioning model to find the types and number of instances that maximize performance while minimizing the externalization costs.

We define code2brain (C2B) interfaces as maps in compilers and brains between meaning and naming syntax, which help to understand executable code. While working toward an Evolvix syntax for general-purpose programming that makes accurate modeling easy for biologists, we observed how names affect C2B quality. To protect learning and coding investments, C2B interfaces require long-term backward compatibility and semantic reproducibility (accurate reproduction of computational meaning from coder-brains to reader-brains by code alone). Semantic reproducibility is often assumed until confusing synonyms degrade modeling in biology to deciphering exercises. We highlight empirical naming priorities from diverse individuals and roles of names in different modes of computing to show how naming easily becomes impossibly difficult. We present the Evolvix BEST (Brief, Explicit, Summarizing, Technical) Names concept for reducing naming priority conflicts, test it on a real challenge by naming subfolders for the Project Organization Stabilizing Tool system, and provide naming questionnaires designed to facilitate C2B debugging by improving names used as keywords in a stabilizing programming language.

The workflow for remote sensing quantitative retrieval plays an important role in remote sensing Grid and Cloud computing services, which can support the modelling, construction and implementation of large-scale complicated applications of remote sensing science. The validation of workflow is important in order to support the large-scale sophisticated scientific computation processes with enhanced performance and to minimize potential waste of time and resources. To research the semantic correctness of user-defined workflows, in this paper, we propose a workflow validation method based on tacit knowledge research in the remote sensing domain. We first discuss the remote sensing model and metadata. Through detailed analysis, we then discuss the method of extracting the domain tacit knowledge and expressing the knowledge with ontology.

The primary disadvantage for an SME to enter the emerging PaaS market is the possibility of being locked into a certain platform, mostly provided by the market's giants. The PaaSport project focuses on facilitating SMEs to deploy business applications on the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering and to seamlessly migrate these applications on demand, via a thin, non-intrusive Cloud-broker, in the form of a Cloud PaaS Marketplace. PaaSport enables PaaS provider SMEs to roll out semantically interoperable PaaS offerings, by annotating them using a unified PaaS semantic model that has been defined as an OWL ontology. In this paper we focus on the recommendation algorithm that has been developed on top of the ontology, for providing the application developer with recommendations about the best-matching Cloud PaaS offering. The algorithm consists of: a) a matchmaking part, where the functional parameters of the application are taken into account to rule out inconsistent offerings, and b) a ranking part, where the non-functional parameters of the application are considered to score and rank offerings. Τhe algorithm is extensively evaluated showing linear scalability to the number of offerings and application requirements. Furthermore, it is extensible upon future semantic model extensions, because it is agnostic to domain specific concepts and parameters, using SPARQL template queries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","203-227","","","67","","Expert Sys Appl","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 33; Correspondence Address: N.

We aim to extract basic emotions from short sentences with emotional content (e.g. news titles, tweets, captions), performing a web-based quantitative evaluation of semantic proximity between each word of the analyzed sentence and each emotion of a psychological model (e.g. Plutchik, Ekman, Lovheim). The phases of the extraction include: text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine automated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of semantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The main idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under the assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search engines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through tags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions. Training results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative tests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g. Kendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to each single word. Different from sentiment analysis, our approach works at a deeper level of abstraction, aiming to recognize specific emotions and not only the positive/negative sentiment, in order to predict emotions as semantic data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","327-332","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

Distributed environments, such as multi-cloud environments, can be exploited by users belonging to different organizations. Companies are realizing that they can achieve significant cost savings by outsourcing some of their information technology environments to specialized service companies. This rapid transition has introduced a number of security risks and challenges. The resulting environment cannot succeed at addressing them without the use of access control policies and the definition of trust mechanisms. Access control ontologies, as a structured way to represent real word elements, are widely employed for making the security interoperable and understandable. Ontologies that have been built for this aim suffer from the lack of crucial elements for distributed environments. In this paper, we tackle the problem of trust-based access control models. We define a list of trust elements that should be integrated into any access control ontology. We also provide a mapping technique that permits the exchange of trust information. Based on these two contributions, our reputation mechanism, that builds upon the organization-based access control model (OrBAC), is created. To prove the efficiency of our proposal, we test it in a multi-cloud environment. Then, we conduct a set of experiments that show the high accuracy level of our system.

In this paper, two main kinds of common fuzzy knowledge are sorted out, and there is a great significance for ontology representation of common fuzzy knowledge in semantic web. In addition, searching knowledge in ontology is the most common operation of semantic web, but heterogeneous ontologies seriously affect accuracy of information retrieval, and ontology mapping is the key to solve the problem. Therefore, in this paper, firstly an ontology representation method of common fuzzy knowledge is presented. Common fuzzy knowledge is polytypic and includes most commonly used fuzzy knowledge in reality. So fuzzy sets and Cloud Model are used to reflect and represent these 2 types of common fuzzy knowledge in ontology. Then, based on the ontology representation method of common fuzzy knowledge mentioned above, a corresponding algorithm of ontology mapping is presented, which is based on similarity calculation of concepts and Support Vector Machine. The proposed methods extend the scope of ontology application and are significant for information retrieval of fuzzy knowledge in the semantic web. The experiments show that the proposed methods are practicable and effective. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:39","2025-11-10 09:29:39","","184-195","","","215","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: J.

An example is semantic searching algorithms, which require the user to input one or two real world concepts. Systems that implement mobile learning approaches like ambient learning can use semantic searching algorithms to support research supervision services through mobile phones. However, there is low adoption of such approaches in some of the African universities. This has been attributed to limited technical limitations of mobile devices that include mobile phones. For instance, complex interfaces, restricted input and small screens on mobile phones make it difficult to enter search keywords when the user is in a hurry. As an attempt to address these limitations, this paper describes dynamic heuristics - greedy search algorithm that automatically generate search keywords.

However, many enterprises are reluctant to adopt cloud services for supporting their critical operations due to security and privacy concerns. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise a set of policies that infuse adequate security controls in cloud services. However, the heterogeneous nature of these services, together with the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, hinders the formulation of an effective and interoperable set of policies that is suitable for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work proposes an approach to the construction of ontological templates for the semantic representation of policies. These templates are capable of capturing the knowledge that must be infused into a policy in order for it to adequately take into account the needs of the underlying domain of application in which it is to be enforced.

In addition, the dynamic nature of the cloud could lead to severe SLA violations.

However, a single manufacturing cloud (MC) has limited MR/Cs, due to both economic and technical constraints, and can only provide limited manufacturing services in terms of function, price, and reliability, etc. Using the aggregated MR/Cs or services of multiple MCs is a natural evolution, i.e., MCs can satisfy peak demands for MR/Cs through collaboration, while users can have a wider selection of services from multiple MCs. To address such requirements, we propose a hybrid framework for integrating multiple MCs. The key functional modules and the business models of the proposed framework are presented to guide future integration of MCs. The enabling technologies, such as semantic web and ontologies, intelligent agents, service-oriented architecture, and materials handling and logistics technologies are also discussed.

Banks are likely to enter the cloud computing field because of abundant advantages offered by cloud like reduced IT costs, pay-per-use modeling, and business agility and green IT. Main challenges to be addressed while moving bank to cloud are security breach, governance, and Service Level Agreements (SLA). Banks should not give prospect for security breaches at any cost. Access control and authorization are vivacious solutions to security risks. Thus we are proposing a knowledge based security model addressing the present issue. Separate ontologies for subject, object, and action elements are created and an authorization rule is framed by considering the inter linkage between those elements to ensure data security with restricted access. Moreover banks are now using Software as a Service (SaaS), which is managed by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Banks rely upon the security measures provided by CSPs. If CSPs follow traditional security model, then the data security will be a big question. Our work facilitates the bank to pose some security measures on their side along with the security provided by the CSPs. Banks can add and delete rules according to their needs and can have control over the data in addition to CSPs. We also showed the performance analysis of our model and proved that our model provides secure access to bank data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:29:40","","","","","25-26-August-2016","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

Intelligent tutoring systems are needed to improve the cyberlearning quality. One of the major difficulties is knowledge representation. The current industry standard is to use Web Ontology Language (OWL) forrepresenting knowledge structure. But OWL only supports one ""first-class"" relation, ""is-a"", between the concepts, and different knowledge areas usually need different custom relations to describe the relations among the concepts. For example ""part-of"" and time dependency are important relations torepresent most engineering knowledge bodies. OWL has to use object properties to emulate such custom relations, leading to awkward knowledge representation hard for domain experts to code, validate and use such knowledge bases. This research uses Pace University's extension to OWL, named Knowledge Graph (KG), to support knowledge representation with custom relations. The instructors can use Pace University extended Protege IDE to declare and apply custom relations in a single document. The instructor teaching experience is also coded in the KG to better support custom learning order by students with different backgrounds. The prototype of a knowledge-driven tutoring system was designed and implemented to illustrate how the KG supports integrated assessments, using assessment results to custom student learning order or material, and let the students freely navigate in the knowledge space from general to specific or the opposite, and following various custom relations. A web technology tutorial is used to validate the design and effectiveness of this approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:29:40","","261-266","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

The system manufacturer typically uses these to determine faults in the system. The outcome of this troubleshooting can also assist end-users and clients in solving problems, and provide the production team valuable information that can be used to improve future versions of the product. A Company merger could lead to the same team processing diagnostic messages from similar but different products, in different syntax, leading to complexity explosion of specifying and maintaining diagnostic message pattern specification and recognition for many different syntaxes. This research reduces the above complexity by extending ISO Schematron, the industry standard language for XML semantic constraints specification and validation, with conceptual rules. Pace University Knowledge Graphs are used to describe the concepts or classes relevant to the diagnostic messages of a system, and the new conceptual Schematron rules are introduced to specify diagnostic patterns on these concepts. Such conceptual diagnostic patterns are then converted automatically into concrete Schematron rules based on the syntax of the specific diagnostic messages.

Therefore Doctors and caregivers often rely on human interpretation to check prescriptions which can be error-prone.

The same time period has also seen marked growth in corporate structural complexity. This combination has lead to information management challenges, as the data moving across a multitude of systems lends itself to a higher likelihood of impacting dependent processes and systems, should something go wrong or be changed. Many enterprise data projects are faced with low success rates and consequently subject to high amounts of scrutiny as senior leadership struggles to identify return on investment. While there are many tools and methods to increase a companies' ability to govern data, this research is based on the premise that you can not govern what you do not know. This lack of awareness of the corporate data landscape impacts the ability to govern data, which in turn impacts overall data quality within organizations. This paper seeks to propose a tools and techniques for companies to better gain an awareness of the landscape of their data, processes, and organizational attributes through the use of linked data, via the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and ontology. The outcome of adopting such techniques is an increased level of data awareness within the organization, resulting in improved ability to govern corporate data assets, and in turn increased data quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:29:40","","279-284","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

In this paper we discuss in detail the challenges in automating cloud services management and present our preliminary work in extraction of knowledge from SLAs of different cloud services. We extracted two types of information from the SLA documents which can be useful for end users. First, the relationship between the service commitment and financial credit. We represented this information by enhancing the existing Cloud service ontology proposed by us in our previous research.

However, the existing Resource Description Framework (RDF) database engines are not scalable and are less reliable in heterogeneous clouds. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Acacia-RDF which is a scalable distributed RDF graph database engine developed with X10 programming language to solve this issue. Acacia-RDF partitions the RDF data sets into subgraphs following vertex cut paradigm. The partitioned data sets are persisted on secondary storage across X10 places. We developed a scalable SPARQL (an RDF query language) processor for Acacia-RDF which operates on top of partitioned RDF data. Furthermore, we designed and implemented a replication based fault tolerance mechanism for Acacia-RDF. We present performance results gathered from Acacia with different scales of LUBM (Lehigh University Benchmark) RDF benchmark data sets. We make a comparison of Acacia-RDF's performance against Neo4j graph database server. From the scalability experiments conducted upto 16 X10 places, we observed that Acacia-RDF scales well with LUBM data sets. Acacia-RDF reported less than ten seconds elapsed times on 16 places for running the first and the third queries of the LUBM benchmark on LUBM 160 universities data set with 3.6 million vertices and 28.5 million edges which was 1.7GB in size. Through this work we describe and demonstrate the use of X10 language for development of scalable RDF graph data management systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:29:40","","521-528","","","0","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

This has recently gained a great attention because of cloud pay-as-you-go model which drastically reduces actual IT infrastructure with high performance and continuous availability. In order to effectively utilize existing cloud resources, organizations may look for available cloud resources from different cloud providers. However, cloud resources are heterogeneous and described by different standards which prevents an easy and dynamic interoperability between organizations. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework tackling this heterogeneity issue. We develop a set of ontologies to semantically represent cloud resources by looking at three cloud resource description standards: Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA), Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), and Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI). Hence, our framework promotes the creation of a common semantic knowledge base of cloud resources described using these different standards. This knowledge base allows a seamless translation of cloud providers' resource descriptions. We developed an application to validate our approach as a proof of concept. We also evaluated the feasibility and completeness of our semantic framework on use cases obtained from standard specifications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:29:40","","585-592","","","0","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

In this paper we explain a workflow and the results of a benchmark that examines which Linked Data storage solution and setup should be chosen for different dataset sizes to optimize the cost-effectiveness of the entire ETL process. The benchmark executes diversified stress tests on the storage solutions. The results include an in-depth analysis of four mature Linked Data solutions with commercial support and full SPARQL 1.1 compliance. Whereas traditional benchmarks studies generally deploy the triple stores on premises using high-end hardware, this benchmark uses publicly available cloud machine images for reproducibility and runs on commodity hardware. All stores are tested using their default configuration. In this setting Virtuoso shows the best performance in general. The other tree stores show competitive results and have disjunct areas of excellence. Finally, it is shown that each store's performance heavily depends on the structural properties of the queries, giving an indication of where vendors can focus their optimization efforts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:36:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Wider adoption of this service model is impeded by multiple inhibitors, one of which is a lack of interoperability between proprietary services of public PaaS providers. The paper presents the state-of-the-art of PaaS interoperability initiatives from industry and academia. Although these initiatives evidence interest in solving the issue, they are focused either on system infrastructure services or on enabling application portability. PaaS service interoperability has not received much attention yet. Aim: The paper proposes a Semantic-Agent framework as an effective solution for spanning multiple public PaaSs and integrating differentiated application infrastructure services. The proposed interoperability framework will be independent of specific offerings and targeted at the needs of developers. Methodology: This PhD (of which the current study is a subset) encompasses three primary tasks. First, an OWL-S based ontology for semantic annotation of PaaS services will be designed. Second, a multi-agent mechanism will be devised to enable semantic matching and composition of services. Third, a proof-of-concept solution that is able to span multiple public PaaSs and establish service interoperability will be developed. Contribution: The two main contributions of this research are: i) establishing a comprehensive ontology for PaaS services supporting Cloud application development, and ii) devising a novel framework enabling their interoperability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:29:40","","","","","01-03-June-2016","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

The citizen engagement platform is the outcome of a 3-year Italian national project called PRISMA (Interoperable cloud platforms for smart government; http://www.ponsmartcities-prisma.it/). The aim of the project is to constitute a new model of digital ecosystem that can support and enable new methods of interaction among public administrations, citizens, companies, and other stakeholders surrounding cities. The platform has been defined by the media as a flexible (enable the addition of any kind of application or service) and open (enable access to open services) Italian “cloud” that allows public administrations to access to a vast knowledge base represented as linked open data to be reused by a stakeholder community with the aim of developing new applications (“Cloud Apps”) tailored to the specific needs of citizens. The platform has been used by Catania and Syracuse municipalities, two of the main cities of southern Italy, located in the Sicilian region. The fully adoption of the platform is rapidly spreading around the whole region (local developers have already used available application programming interfaces (APIs) to create additional services for citizens and administrations) to such an extent that other provinces of Sicily and Italy in general expressed their interest for its usage. The platform is available online and, as mentioned above, is open source and provides APIs for full exploitation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:29:40","","388-412","","2","7","","J.

The standard sequential approach used for implementing OQA methods can take weeks if not months for exhaustive analyses for large biomedical ontological systems. With OQA methods newly implemented using massively parallel algorithms in the MapReduce framework, several orders of magnitude in speed-up can be achieved (e.g., from three months to three hours). Such dramatically reduced time makes it feasible not only to perform exhaustive structural analysis of large ontological hierarchies, but also to systematically track structural changes between versions for evolutional analysis. As an exemplar, progress is reported in using MapReduce to perform evolutional analysis and visualization on the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), a prominent clinical terminology system. Future opportunities in three areas are described: one is to extend the scope of MapReduce-based approach to existing OQA methods, especially for automated exhaustive structural analysis. The second is to apply our proposed MapReduce Pipeline for Lattice-based Evaluation (MaPLE) approach, demonstrated as an exemplar method for SNOMED CT, to other biomedical ontologies. The third area is to develop interfaces for reviewing results obtained by OQA methods and for visualizing ontological alignment and evolution, which can also take advantage of cloud computing technology to systematically pre-compute computationally intensive jobs in order to increase performance during user interactions with the visualization interface. Advances in these directions are expected to better support the ontological engineering lifecycle. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:40","2025-11-10 09:29:40","","","","4","10","","ACM Trans.

On the one hand, PSSRC works on a structured P2P overlay which is organized by using Pastry in multiple registration nodes, where each registration node is composed of seven modules namely system configuration, schedule and distribution, P2P communication, access and control, UDDI, resources monitoring, and semantic process. On the other hand, a semantic ontology database named WordNet is used to process semantic queries in PSSRC. PSSRC inherits the advantage of UDDI in that the registration and discovery of Web services are transparent to Web services providers.

In spite of its seemingly simple data model, RDF actually encodes rich and complex graphs mixing both instance and schema-level data. Sharding such data using classical techniques or partitioning the graph using traditional min-cut algorithms leads to very inefficient distributed operations and to a high number of joins. In this paper, we describe DiploCloud, an efficient and scalable distributed RDF data management system for the cloud. Contrary to previous approaches, DiploCloud runs a physiological analysis of both instance and schema information prior to partitioning the data. In this paper, we describe the architecture of DiploCloud, its main data structures, as well as the new algorithms we use to partition and distribute data. We also present an extensive evaluation of DiploCloud showing that our system is often two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art systems on standard workloads. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:41","2025-11-10 09:29:41","","659-674","","3","28","","IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 29; CODEN: ITKEE</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Information management; Data handling; RDF; BigData; Classical techniques; Distributed operations; Min-cut algorithm; Orders of magnitude; Schema information; State-of-the-art system; Triplestores","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the accessibility technologies that we have up to date are meeting the needs of only some, at a very high cost and, as a consequence, accessible ICT for all people still remains a major research and development goal. This work presents an integrated ontological framework for the semantic representation of terms and concepts (i.e., related to user needs and preferences (N&P) with respect to ICT use, as well as solutions, platforms and devices) that are required for addressing the universal accessibility in the scope of the Cloud4all project and the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII). Cloud4all aims at advancing and building upon the concept of GPII through the development of the necessary tools and models for making ICT accessible for all by exploiting the cloud computing paradigm. The main goal of the proposed framework lays in the separation between generalized accessibility concepts, user interaction mechanisms and N&P with the particular details of different ICT artifacts. Thus, the framework aims at integrating concepts related with user N&P, as well as ICT solutions, platforms, devices and their customizable settings along with information concerning their vendors or implementers, in order to (a) offer the necessary expressiveness for defining/representing personal N&P across applications, platforms and devices, (b) link N&P with the conditions/context according to which these shall be applicable for (e.g., considering the user activity and the physical environment), (c) link interaction requirements (originated from user characteristics) with N&P and (d) support the Cloud4all matchmaking process through the mapping between N&P and application-specific settings based on semantic rules and automatic reasoning techniques. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:41","2025-11-10 09:29:41","","49-62","","1","15","","Univers.

However, due to the inadequately described service information, users often feel confused while trying to find the optimal services. Although some approaches are proposed to deal with cloud service retrieval and recommendation issues, they would only work for certain restricted scenarios in dealing with basic service specifications. Indeed, the missing extent is that most of the cloud services are ""agile"" whilst there are many vague service terms and descriptions. This paper proposes an agility-oriented and fuzziness-embedded cloud service ontology model, which adopts agility-centric design along with OWL2 (Web Ontology Language) fuzzy extensions. The captured cloud service specifications are maintained in an open and collaborative manner, as the fuzziness in the model accepts rating updates from users on the fly. The model enables comprehensive service specification by capturing cloud concept details and their interactions, even across multiple service categories and abstraction levels. Utilizing the model as a knowledge base, a service recommendation system prototype is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the approach can outperform existing practices by achieving effective service search, retrieval and recommendation outcomes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:41","2025-11-10 09:29:41","","11-26","","","56","","Future Gener Comput Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 38; CODEN: FGCSE</p>","","","Cloud computing; Semantics; Knowledge based systems; Distributed database systems; Service discovery; Fuzzy set theory; Specifications; Fuzzy systems; Semantic Model; Knowledge retrieval; Ontology evolution; Semantic model; Service agility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Security becomes even a much bigger concern when services built on top of many commercial clouds have to interoperate. Among others, the value of the service delivered to end customers is strongly affected by the security of network which providers are able to build in typical SOA contexts. Currently, every provider advertises its own security strategy by means of proprietary policies, which are sometimes ambiguous and very often address the security problem from a non-uniform perspective. Even policies expressed in standardized languages do not appear to fit a dynamic scenario like the SOA's, where services need to be sought and composed on the fly in a way that is compatible with the end-to-end security requirements. We then propose an approach that leverages on the semantic technology to enrich standardized security policies with an ad-hoc content. The semantic annotation of policies enables machine reasoning which is then used for both the discovery and the composition of security-enabled services. In the presented approach the semantic enrichment of policies is enforced by an automatic procedure. We further developed a semantic framework capable of matchmaking in a smart way security capabilities of providers and security requirements of customers, and tested it on a use case scenario. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:41","2025-11-10 09:29:41","","176-185","","","55","","Future Gener Comput Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: O.

Non-uniform naming conventions, varied types and features of services make cloud service discovery a grueling problem. With the proliferation of cloud services, it has been laborious to find services, especially from Internet-based service repositories. To address this issue, services are crawled and clustered according to their similarity. The clustered services are maintained as a catalogue in which the data published on the cloud provider’s website are stored in a standard format. As there is no standard specification and a description language for cloud services, new efficient and intelligent mechanisms to discover cloud services are strongly required and desired. This paper also proposes a key-value representation to describe cloud services in a formal way and to facilitate matching between offered services and demand. Since naïve users prefer to have a query in natural language, semantic approaches are used to close the gap between the ambiguous user requirements and the service specifications. Experimental evaluation measured in terms of precision and recall of retrieved services shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:41","2025-11-10 09:29:41","","38-57","","1","10","","KSII Trans.

The model is taken as the basis for risk evaluation of information system. After the data to be evaluated were mapped to the same semantic space, they are calculated with the prototype vector of each category, so as to obtain the similarity of the category, and the cumulative sum of the similarity with the weight of the corresponding category comes out. Finally, a mean value is calculated to obtain the risk value of the data to be evaluated, namely, the risk value of the occasion when the data is obtained. In this paper, the safety risk information is obtained from the operating system log and Web application server log of a virtual host; the Latent Semantic Analysis-based Generalized Cluster Classifier (LSA-GCC) is adopted and the MapReduce-based LSA-GCC and LSA-SAM parallel acceleration experiment is conducted. The experimental results show that in a cloud computing environment of large-scale parallel processing, the method used in this paper can identify the log events of a cloud computing system and conduct risk prompt rapidly. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:41","2025-11-10 09:29:41","","227-244","","2","9","","Int.

In this study, we propose OntSaaS, an ontology-based system for SaaS publication and discovery. Ont SaaS standardizes the advertisement process, serves as a semantic-based catalogue for the service offerings and provides competent search capabilities for the user. The main building blocks of the proposed system are the unified SaaS ontology and a semantic business-oriented matchmaking technique that maps requests and offers of cloud SaaS services. The proposed request-service matchmaking algorithm merges semantic-based services metadata with ontology-based hierarchical matching. Prototypical implementation and evaluation of the system proved its performance enhancement in respect of the service utility and success rate. Results showed that the concept recommendation approach employed decreased the service registration process time.

Design/methodology/approach: Guided by a conceptual framework, underpinned by a quantitative approach, the paper uses the survey approach, to address the digital preservation strategies deployed across public sector organisations in Ghana. It underscores the link between the conceptual framework and the literature to analyse the various digital preservation strategies. Findings: Backup strategy, migration, metadata and trusted repositories were noted as the most widely implemented preservation strategies across the ministries and agencies. On the other hand, cloud computing, refreshing and emulation were the least implemented strategies used to address the digital preservation challenges. Research limitations/implications: The paper adds to the existing conceptual underpinnings that have dominated the debate about data management, archival storage, preservation strategies, challenges and best practices of digital preservation of e-government. Originality/value: This study draws its originality from the evidence of studies on digital preservation in Ghana as most studies have rather focussed on the preservation of documentary heritage, preservation and security of microfilms, preservation practices in the public records (Akussah, 2002; Ampofo, 2009; Festus, 2010). The emergence of this study addresses the knowledge gap in the preservation of digital records in a country where little attention has been accorded to digital preservation. The study also feeds into Ghana’s vision 2020 and the information communication technology policy document of the ministry of communication which aims at ensuring that Ghanaians have access to information and communication technology products and services. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:41","2025-11-10 09:29:41","","748-763","","4","34","","Libr.

Many searchable encryption schemes are proposed to allow users make effective search over encrypted data. But there is no tolerance of fuzzy and semantic keyword search in one scenario, which greatly affects the search usability. This weakness makes user’s searching experiences very low. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving fuzzy and semantic keyword search scheme over encrypted data in cloud computing. Fuzzy keyword search ability can allow users input search keyword with small typos, and semantic keyword search ability enable returns the matching documents when users’ search keyword has the semantic relation with the keywords in the documents.

Although semantic web technologies provide the solution to web data interoperability by storing the semantic web standard in relational databases for processing and analyzing of web-accessible heterogeneous digital data, web data storage and retrieval via the predefined schema of relational / SQL databases has become increasingly inefficient with the advent of big data. In response to this problem, the Hadoop Ecosystem System is being adopted to reduce the complexity of moving data to and from the big data cloud platform. This paper proposes a novel approach in a set of the Hadoop tools for information integration and interoperability across hyperconnected manufacturing collaboration systems. In the Hadoop approach, data is ""Extracted"" from the web sources, ""Loaded"" into a set of the NoSQL Hadoop Database (HBase) tables, and then ""Transformed"" and integrated into the desired format model with Hive's schema-on-read. A case study was conducted to illustrate that the Hadoop Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) approach for the syntax and semantics web data integration could be adopted across the global smartphone value chain. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","18-23","","","52","","","","","","","","Elsevier B.V.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Procedia CIRP","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: H.-K.

A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google's Knowledge Graph, although no official documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a definition that is free from ambiguity.

In order to manage the complexity inherent in such ecosystems, VEs are expected to increasingly depend upon policies that regulate the deployment and delivery of these services. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity inherent in cloud services hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable such policies. This calls for a policy validation mechanism that is able to automatically evaluate the correctness of these policies.

The diversity of provided services resulted in interoperability and portability issues. This paper discusses how semantic web and semantic web services can support the hybrid cloud model. It uses semantic web to provide a dynamic integration of in-house resources with the public resources, i.e. hybrid cloud. Different ontologies are proposed to describe the different scenarios of using the third party resources, i.e. infrastructure resources, services and composite services. A new framework, ShClS, is presented for that purpose. While the majority of the other works in the hybrid clouds concentrate on optimizing the cost and/or the response time, this paper proposes the usage of the risk of using resources in addition to the cost considering the privacy requirements of the owner.

To this end, a proliferation of web services is being increasingly available. To exploit such services, an accurate service discovery process is required with a suitable performance focusing both on functional and quality of service (QoS) aspects. In fact, QoS is the main distinguishing factor for the plethora of functionally-equivalent services available in the internet. Accuracy in service discovery comes via exploiting formal techniques and ontologies in particular. Satisfactory performance levels can be reached via using smart methods that intelligently organise the service advertisement space. In this paper, we propose smart ontology-based QoS-aware service discovery algorithms that exploit ontology subsumption as a means of matching QoS requests and offers. These algorithms exploit a variety of methods to structure the service advertisement space. Based on the empirical evaluation conducted, our proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art in certain circumstances. To this end, ontology-based subsumption is indeed a promising technique to realise QoS-based service matchmaking. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","87-101","","","9846 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

However, cloud users (tenants) have limited or no control over the underlying network resources and services. Network as a Service (NaaS) is emerging as a novel model to bridge this gap. However, NaaS requires an approach capable of modeling the underlying network resources and capabilities in abstracted and vendor-independent form. In this paper we elaborate on SemNaaS, a Semantic Web based approach for supporting network management in NaaS systems. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt and improve the Network Markup Language (NML) ontology for describing NaaS infrastructures. Second, based on that ontology, we develop a network modeling system that is integrated with the existing OpenNaaS framework.

The aim is to take advantage from the power of storage and processing offered by such technology. However, in order to preserve data privacy, it is crucial that all data must be encrypted before being outsourced into the cloud. Moreover, authorized users should be able to recover their outsourced data. This process can be complicated due to the fact that data are encrypted. The traditional information retrieval systems only work over data in the clear. Therefore, dedicated information retrieval systems were developed to deal with the encrypted cloud data. Several kinds of search over cloud data have been proposed in the literature such as Boolean search, multi-keyword ranked search and fuzzy search. However, the semantic search is little addressed in the literature.

Access control is the indispensable requirement for protecting cloud resource. A cloud service provider is responsible for enforcing access control and they normally rely upon conventional access control mechanisms. Methods: These access control policies, consider the access control primitives in separation which may lead to abuse of access control. These aforesaid problems motivated our research to center around the provision of access control by considering the association among the three access control primitives namely the user making access request, resource upon which access is requested and operation performed by the user on the resource. Hence Ontology Centric Access Control (OCAC) is being proposed in this paper. Findings: This OCAC circulates authorization rules among the primitives of access control say subject, object and action by reducing the various associations among the associations among the access control elements; it is observed that there is less chance for security violation. Ontology is used since it reduces the times of agreement while exchanging the authorization policies across the security domains. For reducing the number of statements and rules in policy base, subsumption property is used. This reduces the space and time complexity. Applications/Improvements: We are applying our work to protect bank data as banks are embracing clouds to store huge data by cutting their IT costs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","","","23","9","","Indian J.

Multiple stakeholders can capture and map knowledge in a flexible and efficient manner. The major contribution of the paper is the definition and development of an ontology for cloud computing requirements. The approach views each user requirement as a semantic intelligence task that maps and delivers it as cloud services. Requirements are modelled as tasks designed to meet specific requirements, problem domains that the requirements exist in, and problem-solving methods which are generic mechanisms to solve problems. A meta-ontology for cloud computing is developed and populated with ontology fragments on to which cloud computing requirements can be mapped. A critical analysis of the usage of ontologies in the requirements process is made and a case study is described that demonstrates the approach in a real-world application. The conclusion is that problem-solving ontologies provide a useful mechanism for the specification and reuse of requirements in the cloud computing environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","121-128","","","1","","","","","","","","SciTePress","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CLOSER - Proc.

In its essence, distributed intelligent managed element (DIME) network architecture extends the conventional computational model of information processing networks, allowing improvement of the efficiency and resiliency of computational processes. This approach is based on organising the process dynamics under the supervision of intelligent agents. The DIME network architecture utilises the DIME computing model with non-von Neumann parallel implementation of a managed Turing machine cluster with a signalling network overlay and adds cognitive elements to evolve super-recursive information processing, for which it is proved that they improve efficiency and power of computational processes. In this paper, we model the DIME network architecture using grid automata. A grid automaton provides a universal model for computer, sensor, and many other networks. We introduce different types of grid automata and study constructive operations with grid automata, which are oriented at the network construction, generation and development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","352-366","","4","8","","Int.

Furthermore, in the emergent context of Cloud Federations providers need to share knowledge to improve interoperability when negotiating SLA (Service Level Agreements). Intelligent software agents are capable of supporting activities related to SLA negotiation, as well as sharing knowledge into large-scale distributed environments. Since they are usually provided with different ontologies, understanding the meaning of the messages requires the availability of common, global ontologies among customers and providers. In order to deal with this issue, we discuss a multi-agent SLA negotiation protocol which does not need a common global agent ontology. The protocol takes into account different concerns related to the understanding of semantic and technical terms, and the knowledge about the agent abilities on semantic and technical terms are shared among the Cloud Federation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","101-112","","","7","","","","","","","","Inderscience Publishers","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 2 Journal Abbreviation: Int.

This is a geoprocessing service that operates on geospatial datasets and provides geostatistical interpolation (a specific variant called Kriging). This service is based on existing service implementation standards in the geospatial domain (namely WPS standard from OGC). Additionally our service can query and retrieve information that is integrated following the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative. This is a unique capability that allows the service to rely on data, besides the existing ones and the ones provided by the user, that can be retrieved from the integrated information space that is being built on the web.

In open and complex environments such as the Internet or cloud computing, the decision to grant access to a resource must ensure a secure management with a specific attention to privacy and data protection regulations. In recent years, many access control models and languages were proposed. Despite increasing legislative pressure, few of these propositions take care of privacy requirements in their specifications. In this paper we propose to enforce privacy compliance in access control policies.

But the rate of defects in semantic annotations was found to be very high due to the need for human interaction and expertise. The purpose of this work is to verify the semantic annotation of web services. The verification is based on the conventional testing process. In this paper, emphasis is laid on automation of semantic annotations to increase the efficiency and accuracy to provide useful web service through which the required data can be reproduced according to the specification defined by the services. In particular, the study proposed a technique from software testing to address the problem of semantic annotation verification. A software testing has been well proven to be effective for verification of software program behavior according to its specifications. By using a test suite which consists of test cases with specific data values for feeding the execution, therefore the expected outputs are generated as per the specification. As specified by the test cases, the software is executed using the input values. In this way, there is a possibility to identify a defect due to the inconsistency between the output delivered and expected by a test case. The advantages of proposed model are: (1) ease of use when information, (2) automatic compliance to system requirements and specification, (3) improved accuracy, (4) use of ontology based partitioning, (5) efficient defect detection mechanisms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","399-415","","","49","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH info@springer-sbm.com","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Smart Innov.

A multi-agent robot system (MARS) that utilizes reinforcement learning and transfer learning methods has recently been deployed in real-world situations. In MARS, autonomous agents obtain behavior autonomously through multi-agent reinforcement learning and the transfer learning method enables the reuse of the knowledge of other robots’ behavior, such as for cooperative behavior. These methods, however, have not been fully and systematically discussed. To address this, KCF leverages the transfer learning method and cloud-computing resources. In prior research, we developed a hierarchical transfer learning (HTL) method as the core technology of knowledge co-creation and investigated its effectiveness in a dynamic multi-agent environment. The HTL method hierarchically abstracts obtained knowledge by ontological methods. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of HTL with two types of ontology: action and state. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","389-403","","","112","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Springer Tracts Adv.

A key challenge faced by these systems is providing an efficient way to retrieve the information segments descriptor, composed of its metadata and video segments, distributed among the cloud nodes and the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. In this paper, we propose a novel Cloud Computing and P2P hybrid architecture for multimedia information retrieval on VoD services that supports random seeking while providing scalability and efficiency. The architecture comprises Cloud and P2P layers. The Cloud layer is responsible for video segment metadata retrieval, using ontologies to improve the relevance of the retrieved information, and for distributing the metadata structures among cloud nodes. The P2P layer is responsible for finding peers that have the physical location of a segment. In this layer, we use trackers, which manage and collect the segments shared among other peers. We also use two Distributed Hash Tables, one to find these trackers and the other to store the information collected in case the tracker leaves the network and another peer needs to replace it. Unlike previous work, our architecture separates cloud nodes and peers responsibilities to manage the video metadata and its segments, respectively. Also, we show via simulations, the possibility of converting any peer to act as a tracker, while maintaining system scalability and performance, avoiding using centralized and powerful servers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","73-92","","1-2","98","","Comput.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer-Verlag Wien michaela.bolli@springer.at","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: V.

Business Process as a Service (BPaaS), a new cloud service model, has recently gained a great importance for outsourcing cloud-based business processes constructed for multi-tenancy. In such a multi-tenant environment, using configurable business process models enables the sharing of a reference process among different tenants that can be customized according to specific needs. With a large choice of configurable process modeling languages, different providers may deliver configurable processes with common functionalities but different representations which makes the process discovery and configuration a manual tedious task. This in turn creates cloud silos and vendors lock-in with non-reusable configurable BPaaS models. Therefore, with the aim of enabling the interoperability between multiple BPaaS providers, we propose in this paper a semantic framework for BPaaS configurable models. Taking advantage of Semantic Web technologies and data mining techniques, our framework allows for (1) an ontology-based high level abstract representation of BPaaS configurable models enriched with configuration guidelines and (2) an automated approach for extracting the configuration guidelines from existing process repositories. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we extend Signavio with our semantic framework and conduct experiments on a dataset from SAP reference model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2016","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","168-184","","","59","","J Network Comput Appl","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Academic Press","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 20</p>","","","Cloud Computing; Semantic Web; Cloud computing; Data mining; Semantic technologies; Outsourcing; Business Process; Modeling languages; BPaaS; Business Process as a Service; Configurable process model; Configurable process models; Green IT; Semantic technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, heterogeneous services and cloud resources are usually utilized and managed through diverse service portals. This significantly limits the effectiveness and efficiency for tasks implementation. Fundamentally, it is due to the lack of adequate specifications for service concepts, operations and interfaces from diverse cloud service models and types. This paper proposes a service management operation semantic description framework for comprehensive cloud service operation specification. Relying on ontological modelling techniques, cloud service operations are specified via entity classification, attribute assertion, relationship assertion and annotation assertion. Further, the proposed framework benefits from operation reasoning application. It enables intelligent assistance for multiple operation preparation and remote execution tasks. Based on the approach, a cloud service operation ontology and a unified service access and manipulation system prototype are implemented. Extensive experiments are conducted over different cloud service providers and for distinct service models. Obtained results demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing practices by facilitating reliable and effective service access, manipulation and interaction tasks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:42","2025-11-10 09:29:42","","","","1","4","","J.

The lack of metadata describing these resources complicates their classification, search and recovery. To overcome this drawback, it was decided to semantically annotate the available educational resources using the ADEGA algorithm. For this objective, we selected the DBpedia, a cross-domain linked data composed of more than 3.77 million ‘things’ with 400 million ‘facts’, in order to make sure that the wide range of Universia topics are covered by the ontology. However, this kind of process is extremely expensive from a computational point of view: more than 1600 years of CPU time was estimated to achieve it. In this paper, parallel programming techniques and distributed computing paradigms are combined in order to achieve this semantic annotation in a reasonable time. The cornerstone of this proposal is a resource management and execution framework able to integrate heterogeneous computing resources at our disposal (grid, cluster and cloud resources).

Hence, this study designs and proposes a Golf Swing Injury Detection and Evaluation open service platform with Ontology-oritened clustering case-based reasoning mechanism, which is called GoSIDE, based on Arduino and Open Service Gateway initative (OSGi). GoSIDE is a three-tier architecture, which is composed of Mobile Users, Application Servers and a Cloud-based Digital Convergence Server. A mobile user is with a smartphone and Kinect sensors to detect the user's Golf swing actions and to interact with iDTV. An application server is with Intelligent Golf Swing Posture Analysis Model (iGoSPAM) to check a user's Golf swing actions and to alter this user when he is with error actions. Cloud-based Digital Convergence Server is with Ontology-oriented Clustering Case-based Reasoning (CBR) for Quality of Experiences (OCC4QoE), which is designed to provide QoE services by QoE-based Ontology strategies, rules and events for this user. Furthermore, GoSIDE will automatically trigger OCC4QoE and deliver popular rules for a new user. Experiment results illustrate that GoSIDE can provide appropriate detections for Golfers.

Therefore, we propose a dynamic access control model for preserving the privacy of personal healthcare data in a cloud environment. The proposed model considers context information for dynamic access. According to the proposed model, access control can be dynamically determined by changing the context information; this means that even for a subject with the same role in the cloud, access permission is defined differently depending on the context information and access condition.

To facilitate the real-time sharing of data and services in distributed environments, a GIS platform that is open, integrative, reconfigurable, reusable and elastic would represent an indispensable tool. The purpose of this paper is to develop a geological cloud-computing platform for integrating and sharing geological information based on a cloud architecture. Thus, the geological cloud-computing platform defines geological ontology semantics; designs a standard geological information framework and a standard resource integration model; builds a peer-to-peer node management mechanism; achieves the description, organization, discovery, computing and integration of the distributed resources; and provides the distributed spatial meta service, the spatial information catalog service, the multi-mode geological data service and the spatial data interoperation service. The geological survey information cloud-computing platform has been implemented, and based on the platform, some geological data services and geological processing services were developed. Furthermore, an iron mine resource forecast and an evaluation service is introduced in this paper. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:43","2025-11-10 09:29:43","","","","12","10","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","<p>Export Date: 10 November 2025; Cited By: 10; CODEN: POLNC</p>","","","procedures; cloud computing; controlled study; Article; data analysis; information dissemination; Information Dissemination; information processing; workflow; Information Storage and Retrieval; information retrieval; Geology; Internet; information technology; mining; remote sensing; mathematical computing; Models, Theoretical; theoretical model; Automatic Data Processing; geographic information system; Geographic Information Systems; geographic mapping; Geographic Mapping; geography; Geography; geology; spatial analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It provides high-efficiency and intelligent manufacturing services by organizing isolated manufacturing resources in a collaborative manner. Since the proposition of this concept in 2010, relevant research has mainly focused on theoretical frameworks of the CMfg system. However, actual applications of the machining service, which is a key part in the CMfg service platform, are hardly ever studied. In order to explore a feasible machining service mode, prime granularities of machining services are analyzed based on the current state of the manufacturing industry. Then a novel part manufacturing service combined with working procedure manufacturing service (PMS + WPMS) prime collaboration mode is proposed, followed by research of machining resource integration methods. To facilitate prospective implementations, information models of machining services are constructed using Web ontology language (OWL). The prime collaboration mode is expanded to a complete CMfg machining service platform. Furthermore, a working procedure priority-based algorithm (WPPBA) is designed for resource selection in CMfg. Finally, simulation experiments based on actual manufacturing data are conducted, in which the test results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed service mode and the effectiveness of WPPBA compared with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO).

A plethora of heterogeneous devices and services appear and disappear, which expose different behavior with the changing contexts in these environments. Therefore, a service matchmaking mechanism that attempts to identify relevant services in order to fulfill the user needs, has to deal with the heterogeneity of devices and services along with their dynamic behavior. Existing service specifications, such as semantic web services, are often used to abstract the environment’s functionalities and the user tasks without incorporating context-aware properties, which makes them unsuitable for service matchmaking in pervasive and ambient environment.

According to this perspective, the federation is a collection of interacting clouds that collaborate with one another through the instantiation and management of shared subsets of resources (computation and storage resources as well as sensors and actuators). This idea could be profitably used in those scenarios in which different organizations have to share several resources (e.g., emergency response or disaster management scenario). On the other hand, when different independent organizations share their resources, several issues arise. One of them is related to interoperability problems. As a consequence, this work also introduces a framework for an ontology-based resource life cycle management and provisioning in a federated cloud infrastructure. Therefore, The main contributions of this work consists of redesigning a cloud infrastructure architecture from the ground up, leveraging Semantic Web and Semantic Web Service Technologies, and natively supporting a federated provisioning of any kind of resource.

With the objective of enhancing the automation capability of virtual screening process a robust portal termed MegaMiner has been built using the cloud computing platform wherein the user submits a text query and directly accesses the proposed lead molecules along with their drug-like, lead-like and docking scores. Textual chemical structural data representation is fraught with ambiguity in the absence of a global identifier. We have used a combination of statistical models, chemical dictionary and regular expression for building a disease specific dictionary. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, a case study on malaria has been carried out in the present work. MegaMiner offered superior results compared to other text mining search engines, as established by F score analysis. A single query term 'malaria' in the portlet led to retrieval of related PubMed records, protein classes, drug classes and 8000 scaffolds which were internally processed and filtered to suggest new molecules as potential anti-malarials. The results obtained were validated by docking the virtual molecules into relevant protein targets. It is hoped that MegaMiner will serve as an indispensable tool for not only identifying hidden relationships between various biological and chemical entities but also for building better corpus and ontologies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:43","2025-11-10 09:29:43","","591-603","","6","18","","Comb.

In simple term, RS theory work or analysis on the basis of information associated with objects or events. Rough set theory is promising theory that work on intelligent analysis of imperfect data and produce meaningful information related to data according to requirement of application. Other theories like Bayesian inference or Fuzzy set theory are complementary theory that work parallel with Rough set theory on rough data or imperfect data, which is important and basic processing step of many application like search engine, data mining, web mining etc. In image retrieval, rough set theory play important role in classification, clustering, feature selection, feature extraction, rule learning etc. Our interest is to study its various combinational hybridized methods used in image retrieval to address semantic gap. We are proposed content based image retrieval framework with rough set theory for addressing semantic gap by using semantic classifier with semantics decision rule based on image information system. This framework also improves precision, recall and accuracy of image retrieval. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:43","2025-11-10 09:29:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Previous work on evaluating SPARQL queries with Hadoop mainly focus on reducing the number of joins through careful split of HDFS files and algorithms for generating Map/Reduce jobs. However, the way of partitioning RDF data could also affect system performance. Specifically, a good partitioning solution would greatly reduce or even totally avoid cross-node joins, and significantly cut down the cost in query evaluation. Based on HadoopDB, this work processes SPARQL queries in a hybrid architecture, where Map/Reduce takes charge of the computing tasks, and RDF query engines like RDF-3X store the data and execute join operations. According to the analysis of query workloads, this work proposes a novel algorithm for automatically partitioning RDF data and an approximate solution to physically place the partitions in order to reduce data redundancy. It also discusses how to make a good trade-off between query evaluation efficiency and data redundancy. All of these proposed approaches have been evaluated by extensive experiments over large RDF data sets. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:44","2025-11-10 09:29:44","","919-933","","6","9","","Front.

How to quickly locate desired Web service for developers, however, is still a challenging problem that needs to be addressed. Most existing related work employed keyword-based method to search services and focused on matching users' queries with semantic or syntactic Web service description. They seldom took advantage of relationships between services to improve the performance of service searching. This paper presents a correlation search method by making use of several relationships between Web services, to recommend a user with services that are similar, composable or potentially composable to a target service. One important advantage of this method is that it can guide users to find desired services promptly, and thus improves efficiency of the service discovery process. To mine the different relationships between services, several efficient algorithms are presented. Case studies and experiments show, the above correlation search method not only can recommend Web services to users that are relevant to the users' interest, but also can predict composable relationships between services with high performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:44","2025-11-10 09:29:44","","107-114","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Asia-Pac.

And since the cloud infrastructure is complex, the applications on the cloud are therefore complex, which makes monitoring in cloud more difficult. Rich monitors that contain composite and heterogeneous probes are often used in service-oriented system monitoring. These rich monitors often involve multiple entities, and the interpretation may require expert opinions from multiple domains. This paper proposes a knowledge-based collaborative monitoring approach to find out minimal cost monitor deployment in a cloud environment. The approach contains two main phases. In the knowledge acquisition phase, three acquisition tables, monitor-probe relationship matrix, cost of monitoring, and probe-problem dependence matrix, are generated according to diagnosis ontology and monitor ontology acquired from domain experts. And then based upon the three acquisition tables and three consensus building strategies, we formulate the problem of optimizing the cost of monitoring as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, which is NP-Complete. In the monitor deployment phase, the proposed algorithm applies two heuristic rules to address the problem. Three experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results from the experiments show that our approach is effective and produce quality approximate solutions in monitor deployment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:44","2025-11-10 09:29:44","","935-960","","6","25","","Int.

Software Product Line (SPL) employs the concept of reuse considering that it is defined as a set of systems that are developed from a common set of base artifacts. In some contexts, such as in bioinformatics applications, it is advantageous to develop a collection of related software products, using SPL approach. If software products are similar enough, there is the possibility of predicting their commonalities, differences and then reuse these common features to support the development of new applications in the bioinformatics area. Objectives: This paper presents the PL-Science approach which considers the context of SPL and ontology in order to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, and to specify a workflow that encompasses bioinformatics applications of a given experiment. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to enable the use of Software Product Line in biological domains. Method: In the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Line (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Line due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and using this abstract workflow model the products (scientific applications/algorithms) are instantiated. Results: Through the use of ontology as a knowledge representation model, we can provide domain restrictions as well as add semantic aspects in order to facilitate the selection and organization of bioinformatics workflows in a Scientific Software Product Line. The use of ontologies enables not only the expression of formal restrictions but also the inferences on these restrictions, considering that a scientific domain needs a formal specification. Conclusions: This paper presents the development of the PL-Science approach, encompassing a methodology and an infrastructure, and also presents an approach evaluation.

We defined a new model named VRBAC in which authorized users can migrate or copy virtual machines from one domain to another without causing a conflict. Domain users or groups are allowed to share permissions of not only resources like shared files but also virtual machines with others either from the same or a different domain. Three kinds of VRBAC policy conflicts are defined in forms of ontologies, which provide extra access to description logic reasoning and facilitate the policy conflict detection. The experimental results based on Microsoft Active Directory and VMware vSphere suggest that all policy conflicts can be detected effectively and efficiently. Moreover, the generated reports can provide conflict details such as conflict types, positions, and causes, which will serve as guidance for further resolution of the improper authorizations and access violations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:44","2025-11-10 09:29:44","","1904-1925","","10","8","","Secur.

In a public cloud, the cloud service provider manages the infrastructure and it is situated in the provider's control. The documents are encrypted before outsourcing in order to protect the privacy of sensitive data. When the number of encrypted documents is exponentially increased, the search service and retrieval, becomes critical. The process of retrieving files consisting of queried keyword leads to unnecessary network traffic. In this paper, a secure scheme with multi key word search is proposed for encrypted cloud data. A searchable index is generated for the data that has to be outsourced to the cloud. Encryption of data is performed using Association Based Cryptography (ADC). The encrypted data is wrapped with index and then outsourced. The searched result is ranked by the cloud, server according to Robust Searchable Symmetric Encryption (R.SSE) ranking criteria in order to enhance the document retrieval accuracy. This approach provides high security by using ADC.

However, one of the drawbacks of the existing SaaS services is that they offer limited or no personalization of the services provided according to the users profile. Personalization as mentioned in the literature has been a key driver in the adoption and usage of various applications and in providing better service experience to the users. However, overwhelming majority of such personalized services rely extensively on the server side, without embracing fast-developing client-side technologies. In SaaS-based cloud services, utilizing this technology is necessary considering their limited processing specifications. Approaches have been proposed in the literature that focus on cloud-based personalization using client-side technologies but none of them actually address all the different components that are required for a scalable and holistic personalization framework for SaaS-based cloud services.

There are challenges with large and complex amount of data generated every day by social networks, wikis, blogs, emails, traffic system, bridges, airplanes and engine, satellites and weather sensors. 90% of current data in the world has been created in the last two years. Our smart planet becomes more and more intelligent. Besides the challenges posed by such vast amount of data including storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization, there are also much opportunities for the world as it becomes more and more digitalized. This study presents Big Data and highlights its key concepts and state-of-the-art implementation as well as research challenges and suggests research directions for future. IT log analytics, Fraud detection pattern, social media pattern and modeling and management patterns are some of opportunities. Hadoop is a cloud based and open source solution for Big Data Analytics which has been written by java. Hadoop solution is currently still immature.

Philosophers of technology and information technologists alike who wrestle with ontological and epistemological questions of digital information tend to emphasize, as Floridi does, information as our new ecosystem and human beings as interconnected informational organisms, inforgs at home in ambient intelligence. But the linguistic and conceptual representations of Big Data—the massive volume of both structured and unstructured data—and the real world practice of data-mining for patterns and meaningful interpretation of evidence reveal tension and ambiguity in the bold promise of data analytics. This paper explores the tacit epistemology of the rhetoric and representation of Big Data and suggests a richer account of its ambiguities and the paradox of its real world materiality. We argue that Big Data should be recognized as manifesting multiple and conflicting trajectories that reflect human intentionality and particular patterns of power and authority. Such patterns require attentive exploration and moral appraisal if we are to resist simplistic informationist ontologies of Big Data, and the subtle forms of control in the political ecology of Big Data that undermine its promise as transformational knowledge. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:44","2025-11-10 09:29:44","","1-9","","1","17","","Ethics Inf.

They provide proprietary solutions through inflexible pricing and SLA schemes. On the research side, the community is working to define specifications and standards on several aspects of the cloud technology. When standards will get mature, interoperability among clouds will be a reality. Customers will be no more locked-up to any proprietary technology and new players will have the chance to enter the market. The competition challenge will be played on the real capability of providers to accommodate customers’ requests in a flexible way and to supply high and differentiated QoS levels. In this market scenario a mechanism must be devised to support the matchmaking between what providers offer and what customers’ applications demand. In this work we propose the definition of a semantic model that helps customers and providers to characterize their demands/offers, and provide semantic tools performing the matchmaking in such a way to maximize both the provider’s profit and the customer’s utility.

Such methods often rely on statistical tools to project and estimate the reputation of services and of some of their characteristic. However, they usually fail to completely describe the inner complexity of reputation's context.

The experiment results revealed that the average question classification accuracy of QAS when combined with artificial neural network and ontology was 98.76%. Moreover, the perceived media richness was found to be positively related to self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, user attitude, and use intention. Furthermore, this study reveals that combining the TAM and media richness theory provides a stronger explanation than does the TAM alone.

Resource Management is the challenging task between different private cloud because of the interoperability issues since the private clouds are managed by different type of cloud middleware's and each of them has their own mechanism and protocols. To manage the resource efficiently and to increase the resource availability it is essential to overcome the interoperability issues between the private clouds. In this paper a common mechanism called Semantic Cloud Resource Broker (SCRB) is introduced between the Eucalyptus and Open Nebula based private clouds.

Each concern brings diverse effects on discrete assets while analyzing the security issues in Cloud Computing. In spite of various studies, we still fail to define the needs of security, resulting in a slow pace in cloud adoption. Accordingly, a fresh approach is required to facilitate end-users and service providers to better understand the domain so that they can easily address their security requirements and find their solutions. Out of different security measures used by related stakeholders one is 'ontology-based security approach,' which creates a conceptual relationship among entities representing information, having systematic review for the purpose of identifying, analyzing and eliciting security countermeasures. Previous studies reveal a variety of security ontologies that can be used by the service providers, which have different approaches to assess the security; still, cloud service providers and end users find it complicating and lacking in security sphere as there is no specification, which ontology should be used at what condition. Hence, there is an emergent need for a critical review of prior studies related to Cloud Security Ontology. This paper presents a brief discussion on five major ontologies namely: Cloud Ontology, Takeshi Takahashi et al.'s Ontology, CoCoOn, Subramani Keerthana et al.'s Ontology and Nelson Gonzalez et al.'s Taxonomy dwelling upon their strengths and weaknesses. A comparative study is also accomplished using various attributes, which are identified based on the well-known practices with similar studies in security domain. Further, future research directions based on comparative study and the weaknesses sections have also been explored to facilitate the researchers in related areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:44","2025-11-10 09:29:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Int.

Managing large volumes of RDF data is challenging, due to the sheer size, the heterogeneity, and the further complexity brought by RDF reasoning. To tackle the size challenge, distributed storage architectures are required. Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm massively adopted in many applications for the scalability, fault-tolerance, and elasticity feature it provides, enabling the easy deployment of distributed and parallel architectures.

The proposed cloud architecture has semantic middleware for data storage. It is designed for a cloud based environment where client interacts with cloud which is comprised of peers. The private cloud will be available to clients through internet. Each peer in the network contributes its resources to form private cloud. The client can store whole file without dividing into chunks. The various modules in middleware performed different tasks to store and retrieve files from cloud.

A specific field of application is the experimental evaluation of Future Internet related research within federated facilities. Testbeds that want to offer support for this experiment life cycle have to expose multiple interfaces along with mechanisms to allow handovers between them. Existing work rest upon self-contained software components that are bound to specific protocols and schematic data models that aggravate such handovers. As a result, for a testbed the process of joining one or multiple federations is an expensive process. We propose an approach that reutilizes insights of the Semantic Web research to address parts of this issue. In this paper, we describe a framework which abstracts from specific protocols and functionalities by managing heterogeneous resources based on a semantic information model. As a result, different API calls relate to the semantically same resources which allows theses handovers and further makes this approach applicable to related fields such a federated cloud computing.

Ontology quality assurance (OQA) is an indispensable part of the ontology engineering cycle. Most existing OQA methods are based on the knowledge provided within the targeted ontology. This paper proposes a novel cross-ontology analysis method, Cross-Ontology Hierarchical Relation Examination (COHeRE), to detect inconsistencies and possible errors in hierarchical relations across multiple ontologies. COHeRE leverages the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge source and the MapReduce cloud computing technique for systematic, large-scale ontology quality assurance work. COHeRE consists of three main steps with the UMLS concepts and relations as the input. First, the relations claimed in source vocabularies are filtered and aggregated for each pair of concepts. Second, inconsistent relations are detected if a concept pair is related by different types of relations in different source vocabularies. Finally, the uncovered inconsistent relations are voted according to their number of occurrences across different source vocabularies. The voting result together with the inconsistent relations serve as the output of COHeRE for possible ontological change. The highest votes provide initial suggestion on how such inconsistencies might be fixed. In UMLS, 138,987 concept pairs were found to have inconsistent relationships across multiple source vocabularies. 40 inconsistent concept pairs involving hierarchical relationships were randomly selected and manually reviewed by a human expert. 95.8% of the inconsistent relations involved in these concept pairs indeed exist in their source vocabularies rather than being introduced by mistake in the UMLS integration process. 73.7% of the concept pairs with suggested relationship were agreed by the human expert. The effectiveness of COHeRE indicates that UMLS provides a promising environment to enhance qualities of biomedical ontologies by performing cross-ontology examination.

It is characterized by its elasticity, its on demand services and the unlimited resources provided to end users. However, the increase of services number offered by different providers causes sometimes ambiguity problems. So, ontology must be used to relate between different services in order to facilitate their access. Many languages expressing ontology have been proposed namely RDF, OWL, etc. To access them, queries should be expressed using SPARQL. However, generally, users are not familiar with this query language. Therefore, there is a need to an interface allowing them to express their requirements without any expertise in SPARQL language. Besides, given the increase of complex service requirements, it is sometimes necessary to compose services to meet final user requirements.

It allows researchers to construct experiments with data from a variety of sources and execute cloud computing processes for rapid and remote simulation and analysis. The service currently includes tools for the simulation of three major hazards affecting the Asia-Pacific region: earthquakes, tsunamis and tropical cyclones. For scientific results, the establishment of provenance is key to reproducibility and trust. Thus the need for any virtual laboratory to provide provenance information for the tasks it manages is obvious, but the appropriate way to report and manage provenance information is not always so straightforward. Many virtual laboratories and workflow systems provide bespoke provenance management with a focus on internal system use. This has clear benefits for reproducibility within the system, but it limits the interoperability of systems. For VHIRL, a provenance solution was required that was as interoperable with other, external, provenance systems as possible. A related common issue facing workflow tools and virtual laboratories is the need to manage software code. With this comes well-known issues associated with code sharing: licensing, source code management, version management and dependency resolution. There are a wide selection of commonly used tools to help solve these problems, for example Git and Subversion. A key goal of VHIRL was to externalise as much information management as was reasonable. VHIRL is a virtual laboratory: it is not designed to be a data store, software repository, or records management system. A solution was required that could hand off the management of provenance records and code to external services, with links between them, other data services and VHIRL jobs where appropriate. Scientific software can be quite complicated and systems for managing dependencies and source vary from system to system. In order to provide the least friction for authors of software, we designed a system called the Scientific Software Solution Centre (SSSC) to manage solutions to scientific problems and deliver the solution templates, code and dependencies that enable them for use in VHIRL and other Virtual Laboratories and applications. We discuss our integration of the PROMS provenance toolkit into VHIRL in order to generate standardised provenance reports according to the W3C's PROV ontology. We describe the collection of provenance information through the VHIRL service and the submission of that information to an external provenance system. We also present the SSSC design as an example of how to meet the disparate requirements of managing scientific codes and solutions while dealing with publishing, discovery, licensing and versioning. We show how the SSSC assists in provenance report generation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:45","2025-11-10 09:29:45","","634-640","","","","","","","","","","","Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand Inc.

This presented concept goes far beyond traditional approaches and pertinent state-of-the-art software solutions by focusing on business analyses based on knowledge creation and domain-independent knowledge sharing. The proposed approach is based on profound analyses of related work as well as modern service oriented design and business analyses paradigms. It provides semantic complexity handling, structured and multi-layered service interaction, cloud-enabled scalability management as well as predictive business analyses based on semantic reasoning, decision-making support and pattern recognition.

Electric railways are also concerned about these issues, and simulators have been traditionally used to test such infrastructure deployments. The main goal of this paper is to present the Railway electric Power Consumption Simulator, a simulation model and tool for the railway energy provisioning problem. This simulator aims to propose electric railway infrastructure deployments, optimizing the quality of the electric flow supplied to train, as well as saving as much energy as possible. The paper describes the simulator structure, as well as the ontology used to translate railway infrastructure elements into an electric circuit. Because these two objectives are conflicting, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved. Finally, a standard railway scenario is used to illustrate the capabilities of the tool, trying to find the best electric substation placements in order to optimize such objectives. The evaluation shows how the tool can handle hundreds of simulated scenarios using Cloud Computing techniques. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:45","2025-11-10 09:29:45","","428-438","","","","","","","","","","","SciTePress","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: SIMULTECH - Int.

Cloud services are on demand over the network as a service style of cloud computing. How can we meet users’ access to a shared pool of resources? So this work focuses on proposing a method for annotation and searching the services over an open cloud computing source environment, that is constituting group communication entities using an open source platform. To access the services more intelligently, therefore we should explore the availability of machine readable and web service semantics expressed by ontology.

Usually many regulatory frameworks intervene to reflect diverse privacy wishes from several stakeholders. This includes data owners, data and services providers and also the end users. Focusing mainly on medical domains, this issue is particularly important due to the sensitivity of health related data in international data protection law. It is therefore essential to integrate heterogeneous privacy requirements in a semantic model and rules. Thereafter, overlaps, contradictions and similarities of privacy wishes could be detected and a final access control context would be captured before it is finally mapped to clouds operational policies. This paper describes a ontology-based semantic model of privacy requirements along with a logical formalism for mapping SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) privacy rules to a policy language that is implementable on clouds environments namely XACML.

We report our experiments on structural properties of the graph using two crawls, each with about 10 million documents. We find that the DocGraph is scale-free, and with small average distance. Its structure in 2012 is close to that of the Hyper-text Web in the years around 2001-2002, and is not as good as the structure of the Hypertext Web in later years.

To understand the underlying meaning and characteristics of large RDF data, and to reuse popular domain terms when publishing data, capturing emerging pragmatic patterns is critical. In this paper, we propose the notion of term co-instantiation graph (TIG) and a method to build a TIG for a given RDF dataset. We also describe a clustering-based approach to distill a set of pragmatic patterns from a TIG, which reveal the pragmatic custom of highly-correlated terms. Through extensive experiments on a real big dataset containing 21 M RDF documents, we analyze the macroscopic structure of the term co-instantiation graph and pragmatic patterns from the complex network point of view, and demonstrate our approach can not only give an elaborated ontology partitioning from the pragmatic perspective to ease the ontology reuse, but also provide a new way to explore the Linked Data. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:45","2025-11-10 09:29:45","","247-260","","","9106","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

As the growth and complexity of public and private clouds increases, novel solutions are needed, enabling vendors to effectively manage the cloud-based distribution of their services. To this end, this paper presents a novel semantic framework with the main aim to support providers in the overall cloud-based service provision process, in terms of service ownership, licensing, and usage monitoring. The base of our framework is an ontological schema that models service business rules definition and license agreements registration, as well as service usage monitoring, with a special focus on web service and software applications cloud-based distribution. Our proposed ontology supports complex distribution schemas, related to multiple vendor-based service distribution, as well as personalized discount schemas, facilitating the deployment of marketing strategies during cloud-based service provision. On top of this ontological schema, we have further developed service and provider reputation and trust inference mechanisms, which operate on the basis of both service usage statistics and subjective end user feedback. Taking a step forward from the state of the art, our mechanisms also provide personalized discount suggestions, further facilitating providers in defining marketing strategies. Apart from supporting providers, our mechanisms also facilitate users in service and provider selection. In order to examine the application of our framework in practice, we have developed a user interface that provides basic features of our framework, within the context of a real cloud, oriented toward personalized cloud service provision; our framework has been integrated in the ""Cloud4All"" Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII). © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:45","2025-11-10 09:29:45","","142-173","","1","20","","Int.

While deploying Semantic Web into e-learning offers a broader spectrum of pervasive knowledge acquisition to enrich users' experience in learning. In conventional learning practices, a student is perceived as a recipient of information and knowledge. However, nowadays many institutions involve students in learning processes that play an active role in improving collaborative learning platform and knowledge sharing as well as participation. For education provider, choosing a collaborative learning platform is becoming more important than choosing a tool in the new paradigm. Implementing collaborative learning through Web 2.0 is attributed to e-learning 2.0 as an approach for an online learning solution. Researchers have employed contents analysis for reviewing literatures in peer-reviewed journals. In fact, researchers found e-learning 2.0 is not only addressing the need redefining technologies like cloud computing in e-learning but also the need of redefining value added through pervasive knowledge generated from Semantic Web and Social networks.

So the choice among the possible cloud offers, with a strong focus on the choice of services that enable better processes and projects of the business lines, is gaining importance. Nevertheless the heterogeneity of the Cloud services, resources, technology and service levels offered by the several providers make difficult to decide. Besides the inconveniences caused by the “lock-in”, give rise to the need for developers to be able to develop an application regardless of where it is released, structuring and building it in a vendor agnostic way so that it is possible to deploy on the provider that best fits them at the moment. The mOSAIC project aims at designing and developing an innovative open-source API and platform that enables applications to be Cloud providers’ neutral and to negotiate Cloud services as requested by their users, allowing automatic discovery, matchmaking, and thus supporting selection, brokering, interoperability end even composition of Cloud Services among multiple Clouds. In this paper, we illustrate the interoperation of the two components, the Semantic Engine and the Cloud Agency for the agnostic retrieval, discovery and brokering of cloud services. The focus will be put on the way to support the Cloud Application Developer to express the requirements and services/resources in vendor agnostic way and to translate automatically these requirements into a neutral format in order to compare it with the different offers of providers and to broker the best one according to defined policies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:45","2025-11-10 09:29:45","","8-25","","","8993","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The present research conceptualizes, designs and implements a cloud computing-based platform that enables global merchants to maintain a collaborative Electronic Product Catalog (EPC) known as Productpedia. This collaborative EPC platform addresses numerous shortcomings of prior researches by (1) maintaining a single centralized EPC database; (2) negating the need to synchronize and convert data; (3) creating an integrated meta-model ontology for merchants to define previously unclassified product information without the involvement of domain experts; and (4) enabling an Open Application Programming Interface based on RESTful web services to facilitate direct modification of the EPC database by even third-party applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:45","2025-11-10 09:29:45","","370-381","","","9191","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Since cloud computing represents a category of distributed system, negotiation should be established between service providers and consumers in a faster and reliable manner. Automated Negotiation is such a process that is closely associated with Multi-agent Systems. We propose A Negotiation system using fuzzy ontology is addressed by us in this research work where the cloud service specification and consumer requirements with vagueness are stored on cloud ontology. Here, each party needs to choose its own agent in order for negotiation. Agents have both consumer’s and provider’s details and their hard and soft preferences for a particular service. Agents need to negotiate on the basis of a set of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like duration, availability, price etc. as required by the user. On completion of the negotiation process, user receives a feedback from the agent regarding the probability of negotiation. This negotiation framework is dynamic and efficient in nature. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:45","2025-11-10 09:29:45","","432-444","","","8947","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Since that time, developments in information technology (e.g., cloud computing, applications, and multimedia) have altered the role of the analyst. Data production has outpaced the analyst; however the analyst still has the role of data refinement and information reporting. In this paper, we highlight three examples being addressed by the DFIG model. One example is the role of the analyst to provide semantic queries (through an ontology) so that vast amount of data available can be indexed, accessed, retrieved, and processed. The second idea is reporting which requires the analyst to collect the data into a condensed and meaningful form through information management. The last example is the interpretation of the resolved information from data that must include contextual information not inherent in the data itself.

These requirements have to be guaranteed in order to avoid costly SLA violations. However, elasticity strategies, which have not been deeply considered yet in SLA documents, may significantly ameliorate the QoS. Therefore, in this paper, our aim is to guarantee the QoS by introducing the semantic meaning of the elasticity strategies in SLA. In this regard, we propose an ontology-based elasticity approach which allows getting an elastic cloud service by dynamically apply corrective actions. These corrective actions present the elasticity strategies applied following a violation or in prediction of a violation.

To do this, the development of an efficient semantic web collaborative editor for mobile devices is needed. However, collaboratively editing a shared semantic web document in real-time through ad-hoc peer-to-peer mobile networks requires increasing amounts of computation, data storage and network communication. In this paper, we propose a new cloud service-based model that allows a real-time co-authoring of Linked-Data (LD) as a RDF (Resource Description Framework) graph using mobile devices. Our model is built upon two layers: (i) cloning engine that enables users to clone their mobile devices in the cloud to delegate the overload of collaborative tasks and provides peer-to-peer networks where users can create ad-hoc groups; (ii) Collaborative engine that allows updating freely and concurrently a shared RDF graph in peerto- peer fashion without requiring a central server.

The service is non-inheritable on associate as-needed basis and might be termed as service on demand. Typically, the service is hosted on a cloud or a computing grid and is delivered to the organization via the net or mobile devices. Maintaining a conventional IT infrastructure is progressively unable to accommodate the growing range of private devices such as tablets, good phones, and laptops that students bring into the field. To resolve this drawback the projected system presents a brand new integrated methodology for the life cycle of IT services delivered on the cloud and repair necessities then automatism, service acquisition and consumption from the cloud. The IT services life cycle is divided into five phases as requirements, discovery, negotiation, composition, and consumption. The IT service lifecycle is developed and demonstrated by using a semantic web technology which includes a cloud storage service prototype. The archetype allows cloud consumer to discover and acquire disk storage on the cloud by specifying the service attributes, security policies and compliance policies. The proposed methodology will enable the practitioners to plan, create and deploy virtualized services successfully. The key reason to have a semantically rich approach is to automate the process of acquisition and consumption of cloud services. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:46","2025-11-10 09:29:46","","18628-18632","","20","10","","Int.

This inexorable shift in demographics is already starting to place significant economic burdens on those still in the workforce and on society as a whole. To mitigate the negative effects of rapidly ageing populations, societies must act early to plan for the welfare, medical care and residential arrangements of their senior citizens, and for the manpower and associated training needed to execute these plans. A key aspect of these efforts is developments of information technology to automatically provide personal care services with comprehensive real-time data on the charges. This article describes the development of a “RESTful driven Ambient Intelligent Care Services Platform” (RACS) for aging-in-place in the Cloud, which creates an environment of Ambient Intelligence through the use of Ontology, Restful Web Services, Sensor Networks and Mobile Agent technologies.

In order to overcome this burden the recent trend is to effectively use cloud computing, supporting resource sharing, with many services. The goal is to aggregate idle network and to preserve resources such as CPU cycles and storage spaces to facilitate effective utilization and computing. For the above mentions, we need to find an efficient method for identifying the services based on all the results from a cloud based search engine. The assignment and choosing of a cloud service should facilitate efficient problem solving and promote optimal use of resources. One such solution must be able to apply in a large array of information processing units. This project proposes to address the above problem using the Multi-Agent Brokering Approach, for the identification of services from the results of a cloud based search engine in a cloud environment. The Multi-Agent Approach ensures that the agents can specialize in identification of services made to process the requests. It also orders the results of the search with various ordering options such as CPU speed, memory and storage. For achieving this, the proper representation of provider capabilities and ontology relationships are essential. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:46","2025-11-10 09:29:46","","2082-2087","","5","10","","ARPN J.

An ontology is designed to define a common vocabulary for cloud archives, and define the roles and responsibilities for data creation and transfer, including the registration of cloud-based content creation systems. We define the classes, object properties, data properties and annotations necessary to describe the agents, objects, events and rights that comprise a cloud archive. We evaluated the ontology with a prototype system, using real-world examples of cloud systems, digital objects and metadata. We found that the ontology was able to describe the chosen components successfully, and that it improved metadata interoperability between content creating applications and the services providing preservation metadata. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:46","2025-11-10 09:29:46","","1-11","","1","10","","Int.

Deploying software as services is one of possible ways to support better access to research algorithms, test collections and third party components as well as their easier distribution. While provisioning software to computing clouds researchers often face difficulties in process of software deployment. Most research software programs utilize different types of unified interface; among them there are many desktop command-line console applications which are unsuitable for execution in networked or distributed environments. This significantly complicates the process of distributing research software via computing clouds. As a part of knowledge driven approach to provisioning CLI software in clouds we introduce a novel subject domain ontology which is purposed to describe and support processes of software building, configuration and execution. We pay special attention to the process of fixing recoverable build and execution errors automatically. We study how ontologies targeting specific build and runtime environments can be defined by using the software provisioning ontology as a conceptual core. We examine how the proposed ontology can be used in order to define knowledge base rules for an expert system controlling the process of provisioning applications to computing clouds and making them accessible as web services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:46","2025-11-10 09:29:46","","84-111","","","8999","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Ideally, such activities must be performed in a generic and platform-agnostic manner, one which demands an ontology-based approach for the specification and enforcement of the relevant governance policies and the service-level objectives that they entail. At the same time, such governance policies must be expressed in a suitable serialisation format in order to be exposed to the relevant stakeholders and, ultimately, form the basis of Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

Nonetheless, recent developments from service management (e.g., ITIL and COBIT) and cloud computing (e.g. Software-as-a-Service) have brought new requirements to service descriptions languages: the need to also model business services and account for the multi-faceted nature of services. Business-orientation, co-creation, pricing, legal aspects, and security issues are all elements which must also be part of service descriptions. While ontologies such as e3service and e3value provided a first modeling attempt to capture a business perspective, concerns on how to contract services and the agreements entailed by a contract also need to be taken into account. This has for the most part been disregarded by the e3 family of ontologies.

We designed an ontological model for a semantic description of the problem and developed a novel utility-based genetic matching algorithm for selecting the Cloud services with respect to the user requirements and the properties of the Clouds.

These services appear to be similar in their approaches excepting that they vary in their key attributes such as price, computational power, and storage policy. As of now, there are no standardized specifications defined for a cloud service provider. Different cloud service providers use different vocabulary to specify similar operations. A number of quality of service (QoS) parameters may be associated with a service, and thus, identification of the appropriate parameter and its management is the vital issue that needs to be addressed by the service provider. In this context, the search engines such as Google, MSN, etc., do not represent the most effective and most efficient tools in order for determining the appropriate cloud service that could optimally meet the service requirements of a customer. It remains as a challenging issue for a customer requesting for a cloud service. Thus, there arises the necessity of a reasoning mechanism for service discovery that is capable of resolving the similarities among variety of services. In this paper, we address a semantic-based service description and discovery framework using multi-agent approach, where the cloud service descriptions that are automated based on shared ontology, contribute to optimal discovery of appropriate services as requested by consumers. © Springer India 2015. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2015","2025-11-10 09:29:46","2025-11-10 09:29:46","","337-348","","","308 AISC","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: VOLUME 1 Journal Abbreviation: Adv.

On a daily basis, healthcare services deal with different kinds of digital information ranging from structured to unstructured. The widespread adoption of electronic health records have resulted in an improved patient health and safety as well as significant savings in healthcare costs. Moreover, deploying healthcare records over cloud environment will enable access of critical patient's information at any time and from anywhere. But many enterprises are facing a major research challenge due to the unavailability of suitable cloud architecture for design, development, and deployment of healthcare services. In this paper, a flexible architecture for SaaS-based healthcare services has been proposed specifically for healthcare applications, which is capable of semi-structured healthcare data management and storing compatible with Health Level Seven (HL7) standard (Hennessy et al. in A framework and ontology for mobile sensor platforms in home health management, 2013; Liu et al. in iSMART: ontology-based semantic query of CDA documents AMIA annual symposium, pp. 375-379, 2009) [6, 7].

We constructs a multi-level resource graph model for cloud platforms, which realizes the formal description of resource entities, attributes and relationships. Based on this, we designe a resource capacity prediction method that integrates graph neural networks, which improves prediction accuracy by modeling node feature sequences. Meanwhile, we propose an improved multi-objective optimization algorithm that maximizes resource utilization, minimizes system energy consumption, and balances load as optimization objectives, ultimately achieving adaptive optimization of scheduling schemes. The experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, the proposed method improves resource utilization by 24%, reduces average response time by 52.8%, and achieves an SLA satisfaction rate of 98%. Further, in large-scale scenarios (1000+containers), the algorithm can converge to a stable solution within 9 iterations. When the cluster size expanded from 10 nodes to 50 nodes, the scheduling decision time only increased by 42%, verifying the good scalability of this method. The research results have important theoretical and practical value for improving the efficiency of cloud platform resource management.","2025","2025-11-10 09:33:01","2025-11-10 09:33:01","","189–192","","","","","","","BDCTA '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud Computing; Knowledge Graph; Multi-objective Optimization; Resource Scheduling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2WM9QNEF","conferencePaper","2022","El-Darieby, Mohamed; Daoud, George; Patel, Monil","Autonomous Vehicles Technology Stack &amp; Generated Data","Proceedings of the 32nd Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","","","","","This workshop discusses, presents, and demos examples of how advances in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) will benefit Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). CAV technologies provide an enormous opportunity to generate and collect traffic datasets that directly impact Highway Traffic Management Operations (HTOps). CAV provides novel datasets in terms of types and pervasiveness of coverage of highway networks at a scale that we have not been exposed to before. This enables current HTOps for extensions in features and enhancements in accuracies. HTOps, as defined by Canadian ITS architecture [1], aims at managing traffic to enhance the efficiency of highways, avoid congestion, increase the safety of travelers, and enable more sustainable transportation. This workshop focuses on answering the following question “What (and How) are the features of CAV-generated data that can leverage (HTOps)?” We compare CAV-generated data to traditional traffic data (those collected from relatively “fixed location” sources such as CCTV, electronic loop detectors) and those collected from probe floating vehicles.Extensive research has been conducted into creating self-driving cars that can drive and maneuver on roads in a safe manner. This is embodied in the development of advanced safety features that include blind spot information, reversing/ parking/ lane change assistance, collision warning, and more. CAV can make movement actions based on knowledge of surroundings which relies on hundreds of thousands of data points collected from embedded sensors (LiDAR, cameras, radars, OBD unit, an IMU), (estimated at) a few Terabytes/Vehicle/Day. For example, Volvo’s Cirrus [2] and Lyft Level 5 [3] open-sourced datasets make use of high-resolution video cameras as well as LiDAR sensors to produce Gaussian points that monitor vehicle 3600 surroundings.As an example HTOPS service, we discuss in detail Variable Speed Limits (VSL) and how CAV data can be used to optimize maximum travel speed limit in a dynamic manner over different highway zones based on traffic, congestion, and weather. VSL helps achieve the objectives of HTOps, including devising premeditated plans for peak hours operations and controlling the travel speed in order to increase the throughput of vehicles. To increase safety and ensure compliance, gradual implementation through increments/ decrements of speed along highway zones is required. The extent, expressiveness and quality of CAV data can help achieve such advanced HTOps. For example, the nuScenes dataset [4] that uses linked data to break down and simplify data schema (with various objects such as Category, Ego Pose, Instance, Lidarseg, Map, Sample_annotation, and Sample Data.) With the help of distance measurements, space headings can be accurately defined for vehicles in front and behind the main car. In addition, current vehicle speed data can be obtained from onboard in real-time. This can also be extended to other HTOps services such as Dynamic Lane Management (DLM) which sets lane allocation rules based on the given traffic state, assigning a lane(s) to a prioritized class of vehicle or assigning variable travel speeds for each lane.CAV manufacturers and researchers have made significant progress in building a CAV technology stack that allows a vehicle to drive itself in a safe manner. The technology stack consists of sensing (described above), perception, prediction, and planning layers. The higher three layers use sophisticated deep learning machine learning to process collected data and produce further information on highway traffic conditions. For example, with camera footage, object (e.g. pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs) detection software can be applied to identify, categorize and characterize surrounding objects. At the same time, LiDAR data can be mapped to provide a bird’s eye spatial view of the surrounding area. Such semantic object maps with binding boxes on objects and trajectory lines are valuable data that TMCs can use to understand the current roadway environment. This is important for understanding stopping time, and congestion levels between cars on the highway provided the current lane of the vehicle. However, due to how recent such developments are, the focus has been on developing the sensing and perception layers of that stack, with much less focus given to the prediction and planning layers.","2022","2025-11-10 09:33:01","2025-11-10 09:33:01","","227–228","","","","","","","CASCON '22","","","","IBM Corp.","USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Toronto, Canada","","","","Cloud computing; artificial intelligence; microservices; cloud operations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
