ENHANCED SECURITY MECHANISM AGAINST MALICIOUS ATTACKS FROM INTRUDERS IN CLOUDS,"N. Abhishek, M. Rakesh Chowdary, A. Yashwanth Reddy","Cloud computing is architecture for providing computing service via the internet on demand and pay per use access to a pool of shared resources namely networks, storage, servers, services and applications, without physically acquiring them. So it saves managing cost and time for organizations. Many industries, such as banking, healthcare and education are moving towards the cloud due to the efficiency of services provided by the pay-per-use pattern based on the resources such as processing power used, transactions carried out, bandwidth consumed, data transferred, or storage space occupied etc. Cloud computing is a completely internet dependent technology where client data is stored and maintain in the data center of a cloud provider like Google, Amazon, Salesforce.som and Microsoft etc. Limited control over the data may incur various security issues and threats which include data leakage, insecure interface, sharing of resources, data availability and inside attacks. There are various research challenges also there for adopting cloud computing such as well managed service level agreement (SLA), privacy, interoperability and reliability. Some logical and trial results prove the effectiveness of this new security infrastructure to safeguard mobile cloud services.",2017,"Security Issues, Cloud Security, Cloud Architecture, Data Protection, Cloud Platform & Grid Computing",10.5281/zenodo.1034471,,publication
