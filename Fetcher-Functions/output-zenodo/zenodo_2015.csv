The CHAIN-REDS Semantic Search Engine,"Barbera, Roberto, Carrubba, Carla, Inserra, Giuseppina, Ricceri, Rita, Mayo-Garcia, Rafael","<p>e-Infrastructures, and in particular Data Repositories and Open Access Data Infrastructures, are essential platforms for e-Science and e-Research and are being built since several years both in Europe and the rest of the world to support diverse multi/inter-disciplinary Virtual Research Communities. So far, however, it is difficult for scientists to correlate papers to datasets used to produce them and to discover data and documents in an easy way. In this paper, the CHAINREDS project&rsquo;s Knowledge Base and its Semantic Search Engine are presented, which attempt to address those drawbacks and contribute to the reproducibility of science.</p>",2015,"CHAIN-REDS, Cloud Computing, Data Repositories, e-Infrastructures, Grid Computing, Linked Data, Search Engines, Semantic Web",10.5281/zenodo.7720,,publication
"Looking for the Identity of Information Science in the Age of Big Data, Computing Clouds and Social Networks","Barcellos Almeida, Mauricio, Rocha Souza, Renato, Baracho Porto, Renata","<p>In this paper we discuss, under a critical point of view, the current Information Science landscape and some future prospects regarding contemporary information phenomena. We present thoughts about the process of thematic deflation of Information Science, through the analysis of the research objects currently under development in this field. In addition to this, we look at the process of absorption of these and other relevant objects in distinguished knowledge fields. We seek to challenge the emphasis and the volume of interdisciplinary research within the field, and present some comments about what might be the results of such processes for the future of Information Science. Subsequently, we analyze the impact in the Information Science field due to phenomena like information boom, the consolidation of the social networks as interactive spaces, cloud computing, as well as other key elements.</p>",2015,"Information science, Epistemology, Interdisciplinary studies, Information technology",10.5281/zenodo.17953,,publication
Building context-rich Mobile Cloud Services for Mobile Cloud Applications,"Karadimce, Aleksandar","<p>Abstract: Today&rsquo;s mobile applications require more computational by intensive capabilities such as natural language<br />
processing, computer vision and graphics, machine learning etc. These demands cannot be met just by production of more<br />
powerful mobile devices. Therefore, mobile applications will have to become more personalized, context aware, and able to<br />
recognize not only the location of the user, but also their cognitive preferences. To support these demands, the future mobile<br />
computing applications will be built in environments that provide a set of context-rich support services. These applications<br />
will leverage the mobile and cloud computing technology in order to deliver mobile cloud applications or mCloud<br />
applications. Developers will use these context-rich support services as building blocks to realize a large class of basic mobile<br />
cloud services or mCloud services in short. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a model of contextrich<br />
mCloud services that can support the development of mobile cloud applications. The proposed model will be verified by<br />
many use cases identifying the most appropriate services to generate custom-made multimedia output. The essence of the<br />
proposed model will consider the different aspects and influencing factors that are part of the Quality of Experience (QoE)<br />
process and metrics.</p>",2015,"mobile cloud applications, context-rich services, mobile cloud services, data mining",10.5281/zenodo.33143,,publication
