CloudScheduler V2: Distributed Cloud Computing in the 21st century,"Colin Roy Leavett-Brown, Colson Driemel, Danika MacDonell, Fernando Fernandez Galindo, Frank Berghaus, Marcus Ebert, Michael Paterson, Randall Sobie, Rolf Seuster, Shaelyn Tolkamp, Tahya Weiss-Gibbons","The cloudscheduler VM provisioning service has been running production jobs for ATLAS and Belle II for many years using commercial and private clouds in Europe, North America and Australia. Initially released in 2009, version 1 is a single Python 2 module implementing multiple threads to poll resources and jobs, and to create and destroy virtual machine. The code is difficult to scale, maintain or extend and lacks many desirable features, such as status displays, multiple user/project management, robust error analysis and handling, and time series plotting, to name just a few examples. To address these shortcomings, our team has re-engineered  the cloudscheduler VM provisioning service from the ground up. The new version, dubbed cloudscheduler version 2 or CSV2, is written in Python 3 runs on any modern Linux distribution, and uses current supporting applications and libraries. The system is composed of multiple, independent Python 3 modules communicating with each other through a central MariaDB (version 10) database. It features both graphical (web browser), and command line user interfaces and supports multiples users/projects with ease. Users have the ability to manage and monitor their own cloud resources without the intervention of a system administrator. The system is scalable, extensible, and maintainable. It is also far easier to use and is more flexible than its predecessor. We present the design, highlight the development process which utilizes unit tests, and show encouraging results from our operational experience with thousands of jobs and workernodes. We also present our experience with containers for running workloads, code development and software distribution.",2020,,10.5281/zenodo.3598905,,presentation
Detection of Malware in Cloud Computing using Sparse Autoencoders,"Srilatha, Doddi, Shyam, Gopal Krishna","<p>Cloud computing is a most inclining world view that gives conveyance of physical and intelligent assets as administrations over the Internet on request. Numerous malwares focus at customized personal computers (PCs) in cloud condition to obtain secret data and obstacle the cloud appropriation by organizations and clients. In this paper, we consider a way to deal with shielding the cloud from being assaulted by nearby PCs. Because of this issue, in view of the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls are removed from the Portable Executable (PE) files, we propose a novel Behavior-based Machine Learning Framework (BMLF) using Sparse Autoencoder (SpAE) which is worked in cloud stage for detection of malware. In the proposed BMLF, first we develop conduct graphs to give effective data of malware practices utilizing extricated through. We at that point utilize SpAEs for removing elevated level highlights from conduct graphs. The layers of SpAEs are embedded in a steady progression and the last layer is associated with an additional classifier. The design of SpAEs is 5,000-2,000-1000. The experimental results show that the proposed BMLF yields the semantics of more elevated level noxious practices and increments the normal detection accuracy by 2%.</p>",2020,"Cloud Computing, Malware Detection, Machine Learning, Behavior based Machine Learning Framework (BMLF), Sparse Autoencoders (SpAEs)",10.5281/zenodo.3974574,,publication

DEVELOPMENT OF A PROCEDURE FOR EXPERT ESTIMATION OF CAPABILITIES IN DEFENSE PLANNING UNDER MULTICRITERIAL CONDITIONS,"Oleksandr Nesterenko, Igor Netesin, Valery Polischuk, Oleksandr Trofymchuk","<p>Improving the decision-making efficiency in defense planning based on the capabilities of military forces and means for performing purposeful tasks requires new methodological approaches and their implementation in the form of software information-analytical tools. Given the complex information environment of defense planning, it is appropriate for the variants of capabilities development options to be chosen by experts on the methodological basis of multicriterial analysis.</p>

<p>The research result is the development of a procedure, in which it is proposed to generate criteria and evaluate alternative options by integrating ontology, the Analytical Hierarchy Process, and the method of directed graphs. The ontological representation of the data ensures the construction of the hierarchical taxonomy of a domain and the formation of the criteria vector. The Analytical Hierarchy Process is used to conduct an expert evaluation of capabilities by their pairwise comparison against determined criteria. Experts&rsquo; judgments are visualized and controlled using directed graphs. Application of the procedure will make it possible to ensure efficiency, versatility, and simplicity of technical implementation of a procedure of decision making support. The procedure was tested on the example of choosing a capability to conduct reconnaissance for the benefit of ground artillery. It was shown that the evaluation process in the expert activity is considerably simplified due to the graph visualization.</p>

<p>The proposed procedure introduces an innovative tool to achieve strategic goals and accomplish the basic tasks of the defense reform, which is relevant for many countries. The versatility of the procedure creates the basis for its application not only in defense but also in other force departments</p>",2020,"information technologies, multicriterial analysis, ontology, analytical hierarchy process, directed graphs, capabilities, defense planning",10.15587/1729-4061.2020.208603,,publication
A multi-objective spatial optimisation framework for sustainable urban development,"Tregonning, Grant","<p>Future urban development must address climate-related risks, increasing populations and multiple sustainability objectives. This includes reducing development on green space; reducing flood risk; reducing urban sprawl; improving access to public transport; prioritising brownfield development and; reducing urban heat island. Decision makers are therefore confronted with the challenge of achieving multi-objective spatial optimization to determine synergies and trade-offs between sustainability objectives and various risks. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are typically adopted within spatial optimization applications due to their ability to provide best possible trade off solutions to multiple objectives. However, the application of such methods within urban planning is limited due to the specialist knowledge required to facilitate the development of MOO frameworks. This paper explores the abilities of evolutionary computing techniques as a method to support multi-objective spatial optimization. The MOSO framework is applied to a number of UK-based case studies, two of which are presented within this paper (Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire). The study compares a set of spatial development plans and pareto-optimal fronts for each region and highlights the capability of multi-objective spatial optimization as a decision support tool within urban planning.</p>",2020,"sustainable development goals, multi-objective optimisation, cloud computing, spatial planning",10.5281/zenodo.3968850,,publication

Adaptive context-aware energy optimization for services on mobile devices with use of machine learning considering security aspects,"Nawrocki Piotr, Sniezynski Bartlomiej, Kolodziej Joanna, Szynkiewicz Pawel","<p>In this paper, we present an original adaptive task scheduling system, which optimizes the energy consumption of mobile devices using machine learning mechanisms and context information. The system learns how to allocate resources appropriately: how to schedule services/tasks optimally between the device and the cloud, which is especially important in mobile systems. Decisions are made taking the context into account (e.g. network connection type, location, potential time, and cost of executing the application or service). In this study, a supervised learning agent architecture and service selection algorithm are proposed to solve this problem. Adaptation is performed online, on a mobile device. Information about the context, task description, the decision made, and its results such as power consumption are stored and constitute training data for a supervised learning algorithm, which updates the knowledge used to determine the optimal location for the execution of a given type of task. To verify the solution proposed, appropriate software has been developed and a series of experiments have been conducted. Results show that due to the experience gathered and the learning process performed, the decision module has consequently become more efficient in assigning the task to either the mobile device or cloud resources. In face of presented improvements, the security issues inherent within the context of mobile application and cloud computing are further discussed. As threats associated with mobile data offloading are a serious concern, often preventing the utilization of cloud services, we propose a more security-focused approach for our solution, preferably without hindering the performance.</p>",2020,"adaptation , context-aware system , energy optimization , security , machine learning , Mobile Cloud Computing",10.5281/zenodo.4270647,,publication

DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION VISUALIZATION METHODS FOR USE IN MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS,"Yevhen Hrabovskyi, Natalia Brynza, Olga Vilkhivska","<p>The aim of the article is development of a technique for visualizing information for use in multimedia applications. In this study, to visualize information, it is proposed first to compile a list of key terms of the subject area and create data tables. Based on the structuring of fragments of the subject area, a visual display of key terms in the form of pictograms, a visual display of key terms in the form of images, and a visual display of data tables are performed. The types of visual structures that should be used to visualize information for further use in multimedia applications are considered. The analysis of existing visual structures in desktop publishing systems and word processors is performed.</p>

<p>To build a mechanism for visualizing information about the task as a presentation, a multimedia application is developed using Microsoft Visual Studio software, the C# programming language by using the Windows Forms application programming interface. An algorithm is proposed for separating pieces of information text that have key terms. Tabular data was visualized using the &ldquo;parametric ruler&rdquo; metaphorical visualization method, based on the metaphor of a slide rule.</p>

<p>The use of the parametric ruler method on the example of data visualization for the font design of children&#39;s publications is proposed. Interaction of using the method is ensured due to the fact that the user will enter the size of the size that interests for it and will see the ratio of the values of other parameters. The practical result of the work is the creation of a multimedia application &ldquo;Visualization of Publishing Standards&rdquo; for the visualization of information for the font design of publications for children. The result of the software implementation is the finished multimedia applications, which, according to the standardization visualization technique in terms of prepress preparation of publications, is the final product of the third stage of the presentation of the visual form</p>",2020,"information visualization, multimedia application, visual display, key terms",10.21303/2461-4262.2020.001103,,publication

The Effect of Information Technology on Organizational Performance: The Mediating Role of Quality Management Capabilities,"Fatafta, Laith Walid, Obeidat, Bader, Mohammed, Ashraf Bany, Kanaan, Raed Kareem","<p>This study aims to investigate the effect of information technology on organizational performance in Jordanian pharmaceutical companies, and whether quality management capabilities mediate the effect of information technology on organizational performance. Adopting a quantitative research design, data was collected by means of a questionnaire-based survey of employees in Jordanian pharmaceutical companies. Based on 338 usable responses, the results revealed a significant effect of information technology and one of its dimensions (enterprise resource planning) on organizational performance. The Other dimension (electronic data interchange) did not contribute to quality management capabilities. Additionally, the results showed that information technology has a significant effect on quality management capabilities, and that quality management capabilities in turn affect organizational performance. The findings confirm that quality management capabilities partially mediate the effect of information technology on organizational performance. The study emphases that Jordanian pharmaceutical companies should improve and promote information technology methods and practices in order to improve their performance. Pharmaceutical companies should also consider improving their quality management capabilities, as this plays a significant role in enhancing and supporting the effect of information technology on organizational performance. This study states many recommendations for future researches, but the most important ones are to apply such a research on other sectors.</p>",2020,"Information technology,, quality management capabilities, organizational performance, Jordanian pharmaceutical companies",10.25255/jss.2019.8.3.456.480,,publication
Top-K search scheme on encrypted data in cloud,"K. Pushpa Rani, L. Lakshmi, Ch. Sabitha, B. Dhana Lakshmi, S.

Cloud computing is providing people a very good knowledge on all the popular and relevant domains which they need in their daily life. For this, all the people who act as Data Owners must possess some knowledge on Cloud should be provided with more information so that it will help them to make the cloud maintenance and administration easy. And most important concern these days is privacy. Some sensitive data exposed in the cloud these days have security issues. So, sensitive information ought to be encrypted earlier before making the data externalized for confidentiality, which makes some keyword-based information retrieval methods outdated. But this has some other problems like the usage of this information becomes difficult and also all the ancient algorithms developed for performing search on these data are not so efficient now because of the encryption done to help data from breaches. In this project, we try to investigate the multi- keyword top-k search problem for encryption against privacy breaks and to establish an economical and secure resolution to the present drawback. we have a tendency to construct a special tree-based index structure and style a random traversal formula, which makes even identical question to supply totally different visiting ways on the index, and may additionally maintain the accuracy of queries unchanged below stronger privacy. For this purpose, we take the help of vector area models and TFIDF. The KNN set of rules are used to develop this approach.</p>",2020,"Cloud, Data proprietors, Multi keyword ranked seek over encrypted cloud facts, OTP, Product resemblance",10.11591/ijaas.v9.i1.pp67-69,,publication

Aïoli a reality-based 3D annotation for the collaborative documentation of heritage artefacts,"De Luca, Livio","<p>Archaeologists, architects, engineers, materials specialists, curators and restorers of cultural property, teachers, students, tourists, contribute to the daily knowledge and conservation of heritage artefacts. The need to identify a stable common denominator was born from the heterogeneous data produced by those observations. It is the starting point for the development of A&iuml;oli, an application that puts the heritage artefacts at the heart of the process.<br>
Each user is thus able to directly annotate the object, whether it is a site, a building, a sculpture, a painting, a work of art, or an archaeological fragment, to the benefit of their peers. This approach creates a bridge between the object and the information produced by a given community, thus creating a kind of &ldquo;digital epidermis&rdquo;.<br>
The platform also enables a multi-temporal analysis, in order to allow a follow-up on the state of its conservation and possible degradation. From simple photographs, the application generates a 3D representation of the object, which can directly be enriched with semantic annotations or additional resources related to the object (texts, images, videos, sounds. . .).<br>
This service is based on two major technological developments: the democratization of photogrammetry techniques, which allow us to compute a 3D model by correlation of images, and the possibility of massively processing and sharing gathered data through the cloud. This cloud computing performance is linked to a specific development for multidimensional propagation of spatial semantic annotations. Through this propagation process, annotations are automatically reprojected on all the 2D and 3D views of the object (past, present, and future).<br>
This tool, which is anchored in the development of citizen science, aims to create new methodologies for multidisciplinary work, and to put forward new scenarios of comparative and cooperative analysis of heritage objects.</p>",2020,"SSHOC, Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud, European Open Science Cloud, Semantic Annotation, Heritage Science Data, Innovations in data production, Reality-based 3D annotation of heritage artefacts, Aïoli platform",10.5281/zenodo.4279862,,presentation
Sharing Reproducible Analyses with Binder at Scale,"Gibson, Sarah","<p>15 minute talk given by Sarah Gibson during the Tools, Practices and Systems session at CognitionX 2020 (https://cogx.co)</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>The reproducibility crisis in scientific research is well known (<a href=""https://www.nature.com/collections/prbfkwmwvz"">https://www.nature.com/collections/prbfkwmwvz</a>). The combination of &#39;publish or perish&#39; incentives, secrecy around data and the drive for novelty at all costs can result in fragile advances and lots of wasted time and money. Even in data science, when a paper is published there is generally no way for an outsider to verify its results, because the data from which the findings were derived are not available for scrutiny. Such science cannot be built upon very easily: siloed science is slow science.</p>

<p>As reproducibility gains traction in the data science and research communities, the need to package code, data and computational environments is growing. There are many tools that address different aspects of this type of packaging, such as Jupyter Notebooks (<a href=""https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html"">https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html</a>) for literate programming, Docker (<a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/"">https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/</a>) for containerising and porting computational environments, and so on. But they represent barriers to reproducibility as each one requires time and effort to learn.</p>

<p>Scientists work with multiple tools, pipelines and collaborators to produce insights. Project Binder (<a href=""https://jupyter.org/binder"">https://jupyter.org/binder</a>) integrates Notebooks and Docker for generating reproducible computational analyses and combines them with a web-based interface and cloud orchestration engines. This means that analysts do not have to worry about all the moving parts so long as they have followed basic software best practices: their code is version controlled and they&#39;ve captured the dependencies the analysis needs to run. Binder, as a platform, provides easy access to the research for stakeholders by hosting the compute in the cloud and providing a unique URL to make it easily shareable, without imposing additional overheads on the analyst.</p>

<p>mybinder.org (<a href=""https://mybinder.org/"">https://mybinder.org</a>) is both a public service and a proof of concept of Binder&#39;s technologies. This site serves over 140,000 sessions per week and combines resources from four entities in the US and Europe, including The Alan Turing Institute. We support many programming languages and analysts from a range of research domains, and even facilitate a number of remote workshops and tutorials. For example, the Natural Language Processing course powered by mybinder.org (<a href=""https://course.spacy.io/"">https://course.spacy.io</a>) has over 5000 users, and the Institute of Computer Science at the University of St. Gallen uses our infrastructure for their university-wide Machine Learning course for explainable AI (<a href=""https://ics.unisg.ch/"">https://ics.unisg.ch</a>).</p>

<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, mybinder.org has seen a significant increase in usage correlating with the beginning of lockdown and many researchers began working and collaborating remotely. It is quickly becoming the &quot;go to&quot; tool for sharing results and facilitating remote teaching in this new landscape of research culture</p>

<p>Dr Sarah Gibson is a member of the mybinder.org operating team and is personally responsible for maintaining the Binder infrastructure deployed at the Turing. During this talk, she will introduce Binder (the service), BinderHub (the technological infrastructure) and mybinder.org (a public instance of a Binder service, free for anyone to use) and demonstrate how it can be utilised to share reproducible computational environments and analyses.</p>

<p><strong>Relevance</strong></p>

<p>Project Binder represents one pathway that technology can be utilised to lower the barrier to producing and sharing reproducible scientific insights with all stakeholders across domains and organisational structure, such as management teams. Binder is also an open source tool in and of itself and can therefore be deployed and modified within an organisation to suit their specific needs and be more opinionated regarding who has access than the free implementation at mybinder.org. CogX 2019 convened 20,000 visitors from government, third sector organisations, and businesses of all sizes. They represented expertise in technology, finance, advertising, media, and energy and aerospace engineering. Many of these audience members use open source tools and systems to leverage insights from data. It is because of these demographics that a talk on Project Binder would be of interest and relevant to the CogX audience.</p>

<p>This talk will be relevant to attendees interested in the next generation of infrastructure and cloud computing and educational tech revolution tracks. I will explain how cloud computing resources can be accessed with no overheads imposed on the users. I will also give examples on how mybinder.org is being utilised for remote workshops and teaching in such a way that the students don&#39;t have to worry about setting up their environments correctly.</p>

<p>The talk will be accessible for all audiences, there will be no assumed knowledge or technological expertise required.</p>",2020,,10.5281/zenodo.3885704,,presentation

A FRAMEWORK FOR A SMART SOCIALBLOOD DONATION SYSTEM BASEDON MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING,Almetwally M. Mostafa,"<p>Blood Donation and Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) are crucial for saving people&rsquo;s lives. Recently, worldwide efforts have been undertaken to utilize social media and smartphone applications to make the blood donation process more convenient, offer additional services, and create communities around blood donation centers. Blood banks suffer frequent shortage of blood;hence, advertisements are frequently seen on social networks urging healthy individuals to donate blood for patients who urgently require blood transfusion. The blood donation processusuallyconsumesa lot of time and effort from both donors and medical staff since there is no concrete information system that allows donorsand blood donation centers communicate efficiently and coordinate with each other tominimize time and effort required for blood donation process. Moreover, most blood banks work in isolation and are not integrated with other blood donation centers and health organizations which affect the blood donation and blood transfusion services&rsquo; quality. This work aims at developing a Blood Donation System (BDS) based on the cutting-edge information technologies of cloud computing and mobile computing. The proposedsystem facilitates communication between blood donorsand blood donation centers and integrates the blood information dispersed among different blood donation centers and health organizations acrossa country.Stakeholders will be able to use the BDS as an application installed on their smartphones to help them complete the blood donation process with minimal effort and time. Thisapplication helps people receive notifications on urgent blood donation calls, know their eligibility to give blood, search for the nearest blood center, and reserve a convenient appointment using temporal and/or spatial information. It also helps establish a blood donation community through social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>",2020,Blood donation systems; Cloud computing; Mobile computing; Ontology,10.5281/zenodo.3932681,,publication
Teaching Writing in the Cloud: Networked Writing Communities in the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Classrooms,"Limbu, Marohang","<p>Our knowledge is constantly shifting from analog to digital literacies, industrial to information societies, paper to screen literacies, and mono-modal to multimodal literacies, for which digital technology has become a disruptive force. Whether we realize or not, we are invariably encountering digital technologies and are embracing such knowledge shift/epistemic shift in business, science, education, and engineering alike. This epistemic shift demonstrates that digital literacy has become an inescapable element in the twenty-first century&rsquo;s networked communities. Based on the epistemic transformation, this article discusses potentials of teaching writing in the cloud, such as how instructors can welcome this epistemic shift in the writing classes; how instructors can engage students in cloud environment; how students can share a complex set of linguistic and cultural narratives; and how students can collaborate and cooperate to create their realities in the context of the networked first-year composition classrooms.</p>",2020,"Cloud computing, digital literacies, cloud pedagogy, cross-culture, mobile apps, sync",10.5281/zenodo.4252798,,publication
"FROM LATENCY, THROUGH OUTBREAK, TO DECLINE: DETECTING DIFFERENT STATES OF EMERGENCY EVENTS USING WEB RESOURCES","S. Vatchala, A. Sathish, S. Ravimaran","<p>A crisis occasion is an abrupt, pressing, generally unforeseen episode or event that requires a quick response or help for crisis circumstances, which assumes an undeniably critical job in the worldwide economy and in our day-by-day lives. As of late, the web is turning into an imperative occasion data supplier and storehouse because of its continuous, open, and dynamic highlights. In this paper, web assets based states recognizing calculation of an occasion is created to tell the general population of a crisis occasion unmistakably and help the social gathering or government process the crisis occasions adequately. The connection among web and crisis occasions is first presented, which is the establishment of utilizing web assets to identify the highly sensitive situation occasions imaged on the web. Second, five worldly highlights of crisis occasions are created to give the premise to state discovery. Moreover, the episode control and the vacillation control are displayed to incorporate the above fleeting highlights for estimating the diverse conditions of a crisis occasion. Utilizing these two powers, a programmed state distinguishing calculation for crisis Occasions is proposed. What&#39;s more, heuristic guidelines for recognizing the highly sensitive situations occasion on the web are talked about. Our assessments utilizing true informational indexes exhibit the utility of the proposed calculation, as far as execution and adequacy in the examination of crisis occasions.</p>",2020,Events; Emergency Management; Automatic States Detection & Web Mining,10.5281/zenodo.3597067,,publication
