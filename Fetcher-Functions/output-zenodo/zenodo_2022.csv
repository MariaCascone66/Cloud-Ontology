An Ontology based Agent Generation for Information Retrieval on Cloud Environment,"Chang, Yue-Shan, Yang, Chao-Tung, Luo, Yu-Cheng","Retrieving information or discovering knowledge from a well organized data center in general is requested to be familiar with its schema, structure, and architecture, which against the inherent concept and characteristics of cloud environment. An effective approach to retrieve desired information or to extract useful knowledge is an important issue in the emerging information/knowledge cloud. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based agent generation framework for information retrieval in a flexible, transparent, and easy way on cloud environment. While user submitting a flat-text based request for retrieving information on a cloud environment, the request will be automatically deduced by a Reasoning Agent (RA) based on predefined ontology and reasoning rule, and then be translated to a Mobile Information Retrieving Agent Description File (MIRADF) that is formatted in a proposed Mobile Agent Description Language (MADF). A generating agent, named MIRA-GA, is also implemented to generate a MIRA according to the MIRADF. We also design and implement a prototype to integrate these agents and show an interesting example to demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture.",2022,"ontology, agent generation, information retrieval, cloud computing",10.3217/jucs-017-08-1135,,publication
A Mixed Methods Systematic Analysis of Issues and Factors Influencing Organizational Cloud Computing Adoption and Usage in the Public Sector: Initial Findings,Mark Theby,"<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cloud computing has been shown to be an essential enabling technology for public sector organizations (PSOs) and offers numerous potential benefits, including reduced information technology infrastructure costs, increased innovation potential, and improved resource resilience and scalability. Despite governments&rsquo; intensifying efforts to realize the benefits of this technology, cloud computing adoption and usage proves to be challenging, posing a variety of organizational and operational issues for PSOs. This systematic analysis constitutes the initial phase of a larger research effort that involves forthcoming case studies of specific public sector cloud stakeholders; it aims to identify and synthesize the available knowledge on organizational cloud computing adoption and utilization in the public sector to provide public sector decision makers and stakeholders with reliable, evidence-based, actionable insights that inform and improve public sector IT practice and policy.&nbsp;</p>

An Intelligent Model to Rank Risks of Cloud Computing based on Firm's Ambidexterity Performance under Neutrosophic Environment,"Mahmoud Ismail, Nayef Alrashidi, Nabil Moustafa","<p>In recent years, cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary technology that offers several benefits to businesses; nevertheless, like any other technology, it comes with significant risks. Firms can gain a competitive advantage by investing in cloud computing while simultaneously exploring new opportunities and leveraging their existing knowledge and capabilities. Cloud computing dangers, on the other hand, may limit these capabilities. We have shown that prospective cloud computing risks have a considerable impact on organizations&rsquo; performance in two key areas of explorative and exploitative innovation using the ambidexterity theoretical lens. To achieve these goals, the Neutrosophic VlseKriterijumska Optimizcija I Kaompromisno Resenje in Serbian (VIKOR) and multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) techniques were used, in which the Neutrosophic approach aids experts in expressing their opinions using linguistic variables, and the VIKOR and MABAC techniques rank cloud computing risks based on ambidexterity criteria. There are eight criteria and ten alternatives are used in this study</p>",2022,Cloud Computing; Risks; Neutrosophic; Uncertainty; VIKOR; MABAC,10.5281/zenodo.6041467,,publication

CLOUD COMPUTING – KEY PILLAR FOR DIGITAL INDIA,Kirtankumar R. Rathod,"<p>Companies are doing marketing or branding of their products and services using digital media. Life is becoming so smooth and transparent by the sharing of information through the digital mediums. Whether it is a small or a big company, everybody is running for the competition, because they want to lock their customers. In this paper current market scenario is included with respect to cloud computing solution. Data access at present has limitations. Government data which is publicly accessible should have some policy. Cloud Computing is likely to be one of the key pillars on which various e-Governance services would ride. Digital India is a program to prepare India for a knowledge future. Digital India should have policy wherein the Government will be providing information and services to internal and external stakeholders. Cloud computing has become the most stimulating development and delivery alternative in the new millennium. A lot of departments are showing interest to adopt Cloud technology, but awareness on Cloud security needs to be increased.

REMOTE DISPLAY SOLUTIONS FOR MOBILE CLOUD COMPUTING,"Rajesh S. Yemul, Prof. Ms. Aradhana  Deshmukh","<p><em>&ldquo;Remote display solution for mobile cloud computing is an attempt to separate the input/output interface from the application logic for the mobile devices.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Essentially, the principle of mobile cloud computing physically separates the user interface from the application logic. Only a viewer component is executed on the mobile device, operating as a remote display for the applications running on distant servers in the cloud. Any remote display framework is composed of three components: a server side component that intercepts, encodes and transmits the application graphics to the client, a viewer component on the client and a remote display protocol that transfers display updates and user events between both endpoints.</em></p>

<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using standard thin client solutions, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and Virtual Network Computing (VNC), in a mobile cloud computing context is not straightforward.</em></p>

<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These architectures were originally designed for corporate environments, where users connect over a wired local area network to the central company server executing typical office applications. In this setting, the technical challenges are limited, because delay and jitter are small, bandwidth availability is seldom a limiting factor and office applications exhibit rather static displays when compared with multimedia applications. In a mobile cloud computing environment, the remote display protocol must be able to deliver complex multimedia graphics over wireless links and render these graphics on a resource constrained mobile device.</em></p>

International Journal on Cloud Computing: Services and Architecture (IJCCSA),"Sebastian Floerecke, Florian Felix Röck and Franz Lehner","<p>Despite the highly competitive situation within the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) market and the resulting pressure and uncertainty for the involved providers, only little knowledge is available about business model characteristics (BMCs) related to success. Merely few qualitative studies are existing that propose hypotheses on success-driving business model characteristics (SDBMCs), however, a general and comparative quantitative evaluation and thus an evidence for their impact on business success is still missing. But this knowledge is essential for IaaS providers as it would allow them to focus their limited resources and efforts on the truly decisive BMCs and, at the same time, save costs by avoiding activities and investments of minor importance. Aiming to reduce this gap, a web-based survey was carried out, in which representatives of IaaS providers of different size rated the level of relevance of the proposed SDBMCs. As this study is still going on, this paper focuses on presenting the study design and an analysis of the data collected so far. As a preliminary result, nearly 80 % of the SDBMCs were rated as extremely important or important, meaning that the existing qualitative research results were confirmed to a high degree.

Cloud Warehousing,"Ma, Hui, Schewe, Klaus-Dieter, Thalheim, Bernhard, Wang, Qing","Data warehouses integrate and aggregate data from various sources to support decision making within an enterprise. Usually, it is assumed that data are extracted from operational databases used by the enterprise. Cloud warehousing relaxes this view permitting data sources to be located anywhere on the world-wide web in a so-called ""cloud"", which is understood as a registry of services. Thus, we need a model of dataintensive web services, for which we adopt the view of the recently introduced model of abstract state services (AS2s). An AS2 combines a hidden database layer with an operation-equipped view layer, and thus provides an abstraction of web services that can be made available for use by other systems. In this paper we extend this model to an abstract model of clouds by means of an ontology for service description. The ontology can be specified using description logics, where the ABox contains the set of services, and the TBox can be queried to find suitable services. Consequently, AS2 composition can be used for cloud warehousing.",2022,"cloud computing, data warehouse, service-oriented computing, service composition, tenants, service ontology",10.3217/jucs-017-08-1183,,publication

BiCIKL's goal is to realise that vision by linking biodiversity data infrastructures, particularly for literature, molecular sequences, specimens, nomenclature and analytics. To make those links we need to better understand the existing infrastructures, their limitations, the nature of the data they hold, the services they provide and particularly how they can interoperate. In light of those aims, in the autumn of 2021, 74 people from the biodiversity data community engaged in a total of twelve hackathon topics with the aim to assess the current state of interoperability between infrastructures holding biodiversity data. These topics examined interoperability from several angles. Some were research subjects that required interoperability to get results, some examined modalities of access and the use and implementation of standards, while others tested technologies and workflows to improve linkage of different data types.</p><p>These topics and the issues in regard to interoperability uncovered by the hackathon participants inspired the formulation of the following recommendations for infrastructures related to (1) the use of data brokers, (2) building communities and trust, (3) cloud computing as a collaborative tool, (4) standards and (5) multiple modalities of access:</p><ul><p>If direct linking cannot be supported between infrastructures, explore using data brokers to store links</p><p>Cooperate with open linkage brokers to provide a simple way to allow two-way links between infrastructures, without having to co-organize between many different organisations</p><p>Facilitate and encourage the external reporting of issues related to their infrastructure and its interoperability.</p><p>Facilitate and encourage requests for new features related to their infrastructure and its interoperability.</p><p>Provide development roadmaps openly</p><p>Provide a mechanism for anyone to ask for help</p><p>Discuss issues in an open forum</p><p>Provide cloud-based environments to allow external participants to contribute and test changes to features</p><p>Consider the opportunities that cloud computing brings as a means to enable shared management of the infrastructure.</p><p>Promote the sharing of knowledge around big data technologies amongst partners, using cloud computing as a training environment</p><p>Invest in standards compliance and work with standards organisations to develop new, and extend existing standards</p><p>Report on and review standards compliance within an infrastructure with metrics that give credit for work on standard compliance and development</p><p>Provide as many different modalities of access as possible</p><p>Avoid requiring personal contacts to download data</p><p>Provide a full description of an API and the data it serves</p></ul><p>Finally, the hackathons were an ideal meeting opportunity to build, diversify and extend the BiCIKL community further, and to ensure the alignment of the community with a common vision on how best to link data from specimens, samples, sequences, taxonomic names and taxonomic literature.</p>",2022,"hackathon, biodiversity informatics, API, Wikidata, cloud computing, data standards, FAIR data, linking",10.3897/rio.8.e96180,,publication
Intelligent Service Orchestration in Edge Cloud Networks,"Engin Zeydan, Josep Mangues, Yekta Turk","<p>The surge in data traffic is challenging for network infrastructure owners coping with stringent service requirements (e.g., high bandwidth, ultralow latency) as well as shrinking per-gigabyte revenues. Network softwarization and edge computing are powerful candidates to mitigate these issues. In parallel, there is an increasing demand for network virtualization and container-based services. In this study, we investigate the management of software defined networking (SDN)-based transport network and edge cloud service orchestration. To this end, we use a machine learning (ML)-based design to manage both transport and edge cloud resources of a mobile network effectively. To generate and use real-world data inside our ML platform, we use the Graphical Network Simulator-3 (GNS3) emulator environment. Our emulation results indicate that almost all of the trained ML models can accurately select the correct edge clouds (ECs) (i.e., with high test accuracy) under the considered two scenarios when transport and EC network parameters are considered in comparison to models trained via only transport or cloud-based parameters.

A versatile Cloud Computing environment to facilitate African-European partnership in research: EO AFRICA R&D Innovation Lab,"Adam, Fabian, Leclair, Robin, Mora, Brice, Stancioi, Nicu, Roth, Tereza, Farnaghi, Mahdi, Girgin, Serkan, Vekerdy, Zoltán","<p>The African Framework for Research, Innovation, Communities and Applications (<a href=""https://eo4society.esa.int/eo-africa/"">EO AFRICA</a>) is an ESA initiative in collaboration with the African Union Commission that aims to foster an African-European R&amp;D partnership facilitating the sustainable adoption of Earth Observation and related space technologies in Africa. <a href=""http://eoafrica-rd.org"">EO AFRICA R&amp;D Facility</a> is the flagship of EO AFRICA with the overarching goals of enabling an active research community and promoting creative and collaborative innovation processes by providing funding, advanced training, and computing resources. <a href=""https://eoafrica-rd.org/innovation-lab/"">The Innovation Lab</a> is a state-of-the-art Cloud Computing infrastructure provided by the Facility to 30 research projects of African-European research tandems and participants of the capacity development activities of the Space Academy. The Innovation Lab creates new opportunities for innovative research to develop EO algorithms and applications adapted to African challenges and needs, through interactive Virtual Research Environments (VREs) with ready-to-use research and EO analysis software, and facilitated access to a wide range of analysis-ready EO datasets by leveraging the host DIAS infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Innovation Lab is a cloud-based, user-friendly, and versatile Platform as a service (PaaS) that allows the users to develop, test, run, and optimize their research code making full use of the Copernicus DIAS infrastructure and a tailor-made interactive computing environment for geospatial analysis. Co-located data and computing services enable fast data exploitation and analysis, which in turn facilitates the utilization of multi-spectral spatiotemporal big data and machine learning methods. Each user has direct access to all online EO data available on the host DIAS (CreoDIAS), especially for Africa, and if required, can also request archived data, which is automatically retrieved and made available within a short delay. The Innovation Lab also supports user-provided in-situ data and allows access to EO data on the Cloud (e.g., other DIASes, CNES PEPS, Copernicus Hub, etc.) through a unified and easy-to-use and open-source data access API (EODAG). Because all data access and analysis are performed on the server-side, the platform does not require a fast Internet connection, and it is adapted for low bandwidth access to enable active collaboration of African &ndash; European research tandems. As a minimum configuration, each user has access to computing units with four virtual CPUs, 32 GB RAM, 100 GB local SSD storage, and 1 TB network storage. To a limited extent and for specific needs (e.g., AI applications like Deep Learning), GPU-enabled computing units are also provided.</p>

<p>The user interface of the Innovation Lab allows the use of interactive Jupyter notebooks through the JupyterLab environment, which is served by a JupyterHub deployment with improved security and scalability features. For advanced research code development purposes, the Innovation Lab features a web-based VS Code integrated development environment, which provides specialized tools for programming in different languages, such as Python and R. Code analytics tools are also available for benchmarking, code profiling, and memory/performance monitoring. For specific EO workflows that require exploiting desktop applications (e.g., ESA SNAP, QGIS) for pre-processing, analysis, or visualization purposes, the Innovation Lab provides a web-based remote desktop with ready-to-use EO desktop applications. The users can also customize their working environment by using standard package managers.</p>

<p>As endorsed by the European Commission Open Science approach, data and code sharing and versioning are crucial to allow reuse and reproduction of the algorithms, workflows, and results. In this context, the Innovation Lab has tools integrated into its interactive development environment that provide direct access to code repositories and allow easy version control. Although public code repositories (e.g., Github) are advised for better visibility, the Innovation Lab also includes a dedicated code repository to support the users&#39; particular needs (e.g., storage of sensitive information). The assets (e.g., files, folders) stored on the platform can be easily accessed and shared externally through the FileBrowser tool.</p>

<p>Besides providing a state-of-the-art computing infrastructure, the Innovation Lab also includes other necessary services to ensure a comfortable virtual research experience. All research projects granted by the EO AFRICA R&amp;D Facility receive dedicated technical support for the Innovation Lab facilities. Scientific support and advice from senior researchers and experts for developing geospatial computing workflows are also provided. Users are able to request support contacting a helpdesk via a dedicated ticketing and chat system.</p>

<p>After a 6-month development and testing period, the Innovation Lab became operational in September 2021. The first field testing of the platform took place in November 2021 during a 3-day hackathon jointly organized by EO AFRICA R&amp;D, GMES &amp; Africa, and CURAT as part of the AfricaGIS 2021 conference. Forty participants utilized the platform to develop innovative solutions to food security and water resources challenges, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural production or linking the decrease in agricultural production to armed conflicts. The activity was successful and similar ones are expected to be organized during major GIS and EO conferences in Africa during the lifetime of the project. Thirty research projects of African-European research tandems granted by the Facility will utilize the Innovation Lab to develop innovative and open-source EO algorithms and applications, preferably as interactive notebooks, adapted to African solutions to African challenges in food security and water scarcity by leveraging cutting-edge cloud-based data access and computing infrastructure. The call for the first 15 research projects was published in November 2021, and the projects are expected to start using the Innovation Lab in February 2022.</p>

<p>In parallel, the Innovation Lab provides the computing environment for the capacity development activities of the EO AFRICA R&amp;D Facility, which are organized under the umbrella of EO AFRICA Space Academy. These capacity development activities include several MOOCs, webinars, online and face-to-face courses designed and tailored to improve the knowledge and skills of African researchers in the utilization of Cloud Computing technology to work with EO data. Selected participants of the capacity development activities will use the Innovation Lab during their training. Moreover, the instructors in the Facility use the Innovation Lab to develop the training materials for the Space Academy. Access to the Innovation Lab will also be granted to individual researchers and EO experts depending on the use case and resource availability. Application for access can be made easily through the EO AFRICA R&amp;D web portal after becoming a member of the EO AFRICA Community.</p>",2022,"cloud computing, computing platform, earth observation, Africa, research support, capacity development",10.5281/zenodo.6606914,,poster

In an otherwise saturated business, using QR codes for your real estate information might help you stand out. It may especially assist you in increasing prospect engagement and generating more leads. A QR code is a handy, very adaptable graphic that can be scanned and used in a variety of ways. It makes it simple to provide consumers more information than can fit on a single sheet of paper. It also shows how to effectively transfer offline conversations Online, whether by phone, email, text, or a website.</p>

<p>Various organizations have begun to employ two-dimensional bar codes, also called QR (quick response) code, to encode information, like that URLs that can be recited by devices, arithmetical tablets, and other electronic devices in recent years. In this codes might be used to elicit a customer response or a certain activity. Their major advantage is that they relieve smartphone users of the tiresome effort of inputting and searching for information.</p>

Replication Package for: Streaming vs. Functions: A Cost Perspective on Cloud Event Processing,"Pfandzelter, Tobias, Henning, Sören, Schirmer, Trever, Hasselbring, Wilhelm, Bermbach, David","<p>In cloud event processing, data generated at the edge is processed in real-time by cloud resources. Both distributed stream processing (DSP) and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) have been proposed to implement such event processing applications. FaaS emphasizes fast development and easy operation, while DSP emphasizes efficient handling of large data volumes. Despite their architectural differences, both can be used to model and implement loosely-coupled job graphs. In this paper, we consider the selection of FaaS and DSP from a cost perspective. We implement stateless and stateful workflows from the Theodolite benchmarking suite using cloud FaaS and DSP.

An Adaptive Hidden Markov Model with CCA for Privacy Preserving of Correlated Big Data,"Sujatha K, Rajesh N","<p>Due to technological advancements and increase in the use of smart devices, huge amount of data is generated and has open access to various social media servers all around the world. Most of the social media providers seldom care on security and or preservation of private data. One of the greatest challenges that prevail due to the existence of correlated information is privacy preserving data mining. Many research methodologies have been proposed yet maintaining the privacy in social network is a complex process. In this proposed method, a novel methodology for preserving the privacy of Correlated big data using various techniques. The proposed method consists of three main processes they are, correlated big data identification, correlated big data analysis and correlated iteration mechanism. In first process an adaptive Hidden Markov Model (AHMM)used for identifying the Correlated big data present in the datasets. Then in the second process, using the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) the correlation matrix is find out for sensitivity measure. In last process, to answer the large group of queries designed a correlated iteration mechanism. Thus implemented the proposed system and the implementation results are compared with the conventional techniques. Ultimately the proposed method suggests that the performance is better for the privacy preserving of correlated dataset.</p>",2022,"Differential privacy, Correlated big data, Privacy preserving big data, Hidden Markov Model, Canonical correlation analysis",10.5281/zenodo.6625361,,publication

A special place in which social networks occupy. The world&#39;s leading states are conducting information operations in this environment to achieve geopolitical goals. Such processes are reflected in real social and political life. This makes it possible to influence not only the social groups of society, but also to ensure manipulation in political &quot;games&quot; in the conduct of hybrid wars.</p>

<p>The simultaneous interaction of social factors, influencing factors, the presence of communities in social networks forms a full-fledged socio-cyber-physical system capable of integrating real and virtual interactions to manage regional communities.</p>

<p>The article proposes a method for predicting the assessment of social mutual influence between &ldquo;formal&rdquo; and &ldquo;informal&rdquo; leaders and regional societies. The proposed models make it possible to form not only a forecast of the influence of agents, but also the interaction of various agents, taking into account their formal and informal influences, the use of administrative resources, political moods of the regional society. This approach allows dynamic modeling based on impact and relationship analysis.</p>

Identification of forensic artifacts from the registry of windows 10 device in relation to idrive cloud storage usage,"Adesoji A. Adesina, Ayodele Ariyo Adebiyi, Charles K. Ayo","<p>The accessibility of cloud storage over the internet as a result of cloud computing technology provides the opportunity to store, share and upload data online with the use of digital devices which can be accessed anytime and anywhere. These benefits can also be exploited by the cybercriminals to perform various criminal activities including storing and exchanging of illegal materials on cloud storage platforms. The logs of malicious usages can be obtained from the cloud service providers for forensic investigations but the privacy issue among other factors make it difficult for such logs to be shared. Therefore, there is a need to perform client-side forensics to be able to carry out forensic investigation on digital devices as related to the activities on cloud storage. This study identifies relevant artifacts that can be forensically extracted from the registry of a window 10 device that accessed iDrive cloud storage. The study explores different experimental setups for the forensic analysis and adopted an integrated conceptual digital forensic framework in the investigation process to detect relevant forensic artifacts from the registry of a windows 10 device.

Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture-Precipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI); 21-year drought monitoring in Iran using satellite imagery within Google Earth Engine,"Soroosh Mehravar, Meisam Amani, Armin Moghimi, Farzaneh Dadrass Javan, Farhad Samadzadegan, Arsalan Ghorbanian, Alfred Stein, Ali Mohammadzadeh, S. Mohammad Mirmazloumi","<p>Remote Sensing (RS) offers efficient tools for drought monitoring, especially in countries with a lack of reliable and consistent <em>in-situ</em> multi-temporal datasets. In this study, a novel RS-based Drought Index (RSDI) named Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture-Precipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI) was proposed. To the best of our knowledge, TVMPDI is the first RSDI using four different drought indicators in its formulation. TVMPDI was then validated and compared with six conventional RSDIs including VCI, TCI, VHI, TVDI, MPDI and TVMDI. To this end, precipitation and soil temperature <em>in-situ</em> data have been used. Different time scales of meteorological Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) index have also been used for the validation of the RSDIs. TVMPDI was highly correlated with the monthly precipitation and soil temperature in-situ data at 0.76 and 0.81 values respectively. The correlation coefficients between the RSDIs and 3-month SPI ranged from 0.07 to 0.28, identifying the TVMPDI as the most suitable index for subsequent analyses. Since the proposed TVMPDI could considerably outperform the other selected RSDIs, all spatiotemporal drought monitoring analyses in Iran were conducted by TVMPDI over the past 21&nbsp;years. In this study, different products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission&nbsp;(TRMM), and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) datasets containing 15,206 images were used on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. According to the results, Iran experienced the most severe drought in 2000 with a 0.715 TVMPDI value lasting for almost two years. Conversely, the TVMPDI showed a minimum value equal to 0.6781 in 2019 as the lowest annual drought level. The drought severity and trend in the 31 provinces of Iran have also been mapped. Consequently, various levels of decrease over the 21&nbsp;years were found for different provinces, while Isfahan and Gilan were the only provinces showing an ascending drought trend (with a 0.004% and 0.002% trendline slope respectively). Khuzestan also faced a worrying drought prevalence that occurred in several years. In summary, this study provides updated information about drought trends in Iran using an advanced and efficient RSDI implemented in the cloud computing GEE platform. These results are beneficial for decision-makers and officials responsible for environmental sustainability, agriculture and the effects of climate change.</p>",2022,"Drought index, Drought in Iran, MODIS, Monitoring, Remote Sensing (RS), TVPMDI",10.5281/zenodo.6137154,,publication

Development of computational method for matched filtration with analytical profile of the blurred digital image,"Sergii Khlamov, Vladimir Vlasenko, Vadym Savanevych, Oleksandr Briukhovetskyi, Tetiana Trunova, Victor Chelombitko, Iryna Tabakova","<p>A computational method for matched filtration with analytical profile of the blurred digital image of the investigated objects on digital frames has been developed. Such &laquo;blurred&raquo; objects can be the result of an involuntary shift of a fixed camera, an incorrect choice of the mode of guiding the telescope (diurnal or object tracking) or a failure of the diurnal tracking.</p>

<p>This computational method is based on the analytical selection of the typical form of the object&rsquo;s image, as well as on the choice of special parameters for the transfer function of the matched filter for the blurred digital image, which makes it possible to evaluate the required parameters of the blurred digital image.</p>

<p>In addition, determining the number of Gaussians of the object&rsquo;s image makes it possible to perform the most accurate assessment of the initial approximation of the parameters of their shape. Thus, matched filtration makes it possible to highlight the investigated objects with a blurred image of a typical shape against the background of substrate noise. Using the computational method of matched filtration makes it possible to improve the segmentation of images of reference objects on the frame and reduce the number of false detections.</p>

<p>The developed computational method for matched filtration with analytical profile of the blurred digital image of the investigated objects on the frames was tested in practice as part of the research of the CoLiTec project. It was implemented in the intraframe processing unit of the Lemur software for the operational automated detection of new and observation of known objects with a weak brightness. Owing to the Lemur software using and the proposed computational method introduced into it, more than 500,000 measurements of the various investigated objects were successfully processed and identified.</p>",2022,"matched filter, transfer function, OLS evaluation, Gaussian, image processing",10.15587/1729-4061.2022.265309,,publication

In this study, a novel RS-based Drought Index (RSDI) named Temperature-Vegetation-soil MoisturePrecipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI) was proposed. To the best of our knowledge, TVMPDI is the first RSDI using four different drought indicators in its formulation. TVMPDI was then validated and compared with six conventional RSDIs including VCI, TCI, VHI, TVDI, MPDI and TVMDI. To this end, precipitation and soil temperature in-situ data have been used. Different time scales of meteorological Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) index have also been used for the validation of the RSDIs. TVMPDI was highly correlated with the monthly precipitation and soil temperature in-situ data at 0.76 and 0.81 values respectively. The correlation coefficients between the RSDIs and 3-month SPI ranged from 0.07 to 0.28, identifying the TVMPDI as the most suitable index for subsequent analyses. Since the proposed TVMPDI could considerably outperform the other selected RSDIs, all spatiotemporal drought monitoring analyses in Iran were conducted by TVMPDI over the past 21 years. In this study, different products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) datasets containing 15,206 images were used on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. According to the results, Iran experienced the most severe drought in 2000 with a 0.715 TVMPDI value lasting for almost two years. Conversely, the TVMPDI showed a minimum value equal to 0.6781 in 2019 as the lowest annual drought level. The drought severity and trend in the 31 provinces of Iran have also been mapped. Consequently, various levels of decrease over the 21 years were found for different provinces, while Isfahan and Gilan were the only provinces showing an ascending drought trend (with a 0.004% and 0.002% trendline slope respectively). Khuzestan also faced a worrying drought prevalence that occurred in several years.

Enterprise risk arising from legacy production systems: a probabilistic perspective,"Bludova, Tetiana, Usherenko, Svitlana, Moskovchuk, Alla, Kaminska, Iryna, Kyslytsyna, Olga","The model of estimation of effective minimization of strategic risks arising at modernization of the software of legacy production systems is presented. It is shown that incompatible hypotheses of strategic risks of the enterprise in the digital economy form a complete group of pairwise incompatible independent events, and their probabilities are found by mathematical methods of processing an inversely symmetric matrix, made by experts in pairwise comparison on a 5-point scale of relative importance errors of calculations of the constructed matrix (no more than 15 %). For these matrices, solutions of characteristic equations are found to determine the maximum values of the eigenvalues of matrices, which appear in the assessment of the adequacy of composite expert matrices together with the corresponding orders of matrices.


To substantiate the statistical measurement under the condition of quantitative or qualitative assessment of the risk of occurrence of events, the a priori value of the probabilities of occurrence of risk in the occurrence of events is taken. The full probability formula is the formula for the probability of occurrence of an event of effective minimization of strategic risks. It is shown that to determine the a priori values of conditional probabilities of hypotheses of effective minimization of strategic risks of the enterprise it is necessary to make statistically significant sections of these hypotheses at selected enterprises for several periods, which may be subject to statistical distribution laws. Thus, the presented model for quantitative measurement, comprehensive analysis of the level of software modernization of legacy production systems of the enterprise is the initial theoretical basis for improving the system of strategic management of the enterprise in terms of digitalization.",2022,"project risk, expert matrix, full group of events, conditional probabilities, reengineering, business processes",10.21303/2461-4262.2022.002529,,publication

Dostępność danych w czasach sztucznej inteligencji a prawa człowieka w dziedzinie nauki,"Szoszkiewicz, Łukasz","<p>Kilka lat temu, zar&oacute;wno na forum ONZ, Unii Europejskiej, jak i Rady Europy, zagadnie- nie rozwoju Sztucznej Inteligencji było przedmiotem dokument&oacute;w programowych, analiz oraz projekt&oacute;w regulacji, jednak stosunkowo niewiele było źr&oacute;deł prawa, z kt&oacute;rych wynikałyby wiążące obowiązki dla państw. Nie było r&oacute;wnież pewności, że toczące się dyskusje znajdą przełożenie na instrumenty, kt&oacute;re by takie obowiązki nakładały, a także jak dalece proponowane regulacje będą odbiegać od istniejących rozwiązań.</p>

<p>Pomysł podjęcia tematyki dostępności danych narodził się w 2015 r., kiedy rewolucja cyfrowa wciąż znajdowała się w punkcie, w kt&oacute;rym trudno było określić jej wpływ na nasze życie. Było to przed historycznym zwycięstwem programu AlphaGo nad człowiekiem w starochińskiej grze go, a także przed referendum ws. Brexitu oraz wyborami prezydenckimi w USA (2016 r.), w kt&oacute;rych przedsiębiorstwo Cambridge Analytica wykorzystało analitykę danych do wpływania na decyzje podejmowane przez obywateli.</p>

<p>Objęcie ochroną takiej wartości jak nauka, wiąże się z wyznaczeniem granic dopuszczalnej ingerencji ze strony władz publicznych. W tym kontekście art. 15 ust. 3, ustanawiający ochronę wolności naukowej, zobowiązuje państwa do przyznania pierwszeństwa w uregulowaniu uprawiania nauki samym badaczom &ndash; przede wszystkim poprzez wypracowanie standard&oacute;w etycznych w zakresie prowadzenia badań z wykorzystaniem danych osobowych. Pozostawienie nauki poza sferą imperium państwa, jest niezbędne dla zapewnienia, aby prowadzone badania nie były podporządkowywane celom politycznym, np. dla uzasadnienia polityk publicznych, tak jak to miało miejsce w pierwszej połowie XX wieku. Z praw w dziedzinie nauki wynikają także obowiązki do podejmowania wsp&oacute;łpracy międzynarodowej w obszarze nauki. Realizacja tego obowiązku jest szczeg&oacute;lnie istotna w kontekście wzmacniania dostępności danych, kt&oacute;re stanowią zas&oacute;b napędzający rozw&oacute;j zar&oacute;wno nauki, jak i gospodarki. Otwieranie danych sektora prywatnego przedsiębiorstw zlokalizowanych w państwach rozwiniętych, może ponadto sprzyjać wzmacnianiu transferu wiedzy oraz rozwojowi społeczno-gospodarczemu państw rozwijających się.</p>

<p>Obecne traktaty z obszaru praw człowieka stwarzają silne podstawy dla ochrony praw w dziedzinie nauki. Obok art. 15 MPPGSiK, ochronę przed nadużyciami nauki, jaką jest eksperyment badawczy bez zgody uczestnika, ustanawia art. 7 MPPOiP. Z kolei Konwencja Praw Dziecka precyzuje obowiązek podejmowania wsp&oacute;łpracy między- narodowej, zmierzającej do wzmacniania dostępu do wiedzy naukowej oraz technicznej (art. 28 ust. 3). Rekomendację w zakresie ochrony wolności naukowej wydało r&oacute;wnież UNESCO (najpierw w 1974 r., kt&oacute;ra została następnie zrewidowana w 2017 r.). Przegląd zaleceń formułowanych przez organy traktatowe wskazuje ponadto na dużą aktywność Komitetu ds. Likwidacji Dyskryminacji Kobiet, w szczeg&oacute;lności w zakresie budowania kompetencji cyfrowych, a także zwiększania reprezentacji kobiet w naukach technicznych. Osiągnięcie wysokiej r&oacute;żnorodności w środowisku naukowym jest bowiem niezbędne dla zapewnienia, że prowadzone badania będą uwzględniały potrzeby i wartości r&oacute;żnych grup społecznych.</p>

<p>W monografii wydanej nakładem Wydawnictwa INP PAN, a będącej zaktualizowaną wersję rozprawy doktorskiej dr Łukasza Szoszkiewicza, Autor dokonał analizy wpływu paradygmatu <em>big data</em> na rolę i obowiązki państwa wynikające z praw człowieka chronionych przez międzynarodowe pakty praw człowieka ONZ. Wskazał na obowiązki państwa w zarządzaniu danymi (ang. <em>data governance</em>), w szczeg&oacute;lności tych związanych z zapewnieniem dostępności danych oraz uregulowaniu dopuszczalności eksploracji danych przy użyciu technik uczenia maszynowego.</p>

<p>W najbliższym czasie zainteresowanie organ&oacute;w traktatowych ONZ w tym zakresie prawdopodobnie tylko wzrośnie. Wynika to przede wszystkim z przyjęcia przez Komitet PGSK w kwietniu 2020 r. Komentarza Og&oacute;lnego, poświęconego prawom w dziedzinie nauki. Komitet dokonał w niej wykładni szczeg&oacute;łowych obowiązk&oacute;w państw, wskazując zarazem na konieczność uregulowania wyzwań związanych z rewolucją cyfrową. Należy oczekiwać, że wykładnia dokonana przez Komitet PGSK będzie w przyszłości stosowana przez organy traktatowe ONZ w ramach procedury rozpatrywania sprawozdań państw, a także prac nad kolejnymi komentarzami og&oacute;lnymi. W tym kontekście niniejszą monografię należy postrzegać jako pr&oacute;bę operacjonalizacji tejże wykładni, jako mogącej znaleźć zastosowanie przy okazji oceny wywiązywania się przez państwa z realizacji po- stanowień MPPGSiK.</p>",2022,,10.5281/zenodo.5808312,,publication

The migration to the cloud allowed benefits such as scalability, agility, and better return on investment. Cloud computing requires more significant involvement in software testing to ensure that services work as expected. In addition to testing cloud applications, cloud computing has paved the way for testing in the Test-as-a-Service model.
