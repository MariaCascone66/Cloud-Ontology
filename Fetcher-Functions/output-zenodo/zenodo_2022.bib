  title  = {Cloud computing is one of the most popular and sophisticated technologies adopted by organizations worldwide. Some world-leading organizations enhance their efficiency and effectiveness by using cloud computing technology. Working from home (WFH) has been a popular trend among organizations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The COVID-19 saw a breakthrough in work cultures and environments where working from home was a remarkable success in remote working environments, despite being a rare phenomenon in Sri Lanka. Yet, it is argued that the deployment of work from home has not been effective among Sri Lankan business organizations due to a lack of IT infrastructure, facilities, and knowledge. The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of cloud computing, embracing the service models (Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service) as theoretical lenses and testing the COVID-19 as the moderator. The study has been conducted based on a deductive approach and adopted a stratified random sampling method. The sample consisted of 384 IT employees  among those who had experienced working from home. The study utilized multiple regression and found that cloud computing service models significantly impact work from home with the moderating effect of COVID-19.},
