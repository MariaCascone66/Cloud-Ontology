Clustering composite SaaS components in Cloud computing using a Grouping Genetic Algorithm,"Yusoh, Zeratul Izzah Mohd, Tang, Maolin","Recently, Software as a Service (SaaS) in Cloud computing, has become more and more significant among software users and providers. To offer a SaaS with flexible functions at a low cost, SaaS providers have focused on the decomposition of the SaaS functionalities, or known as composite SaaS. This approach has introduced new challenges in SaaS resource management in data centres. One of the challenges is managing the resources allocated to the composite SaaS. Due to the dynamic environment of a Cloud data centre, resources that have been initially allocated to SaaS components may be overloaded or wasted. As such, reconfiguration for the components' placement is triggered to maintain the performance of the composite SaaS. However, existing approaches often ignore the communication or dependencies between SaaS components in their implementation. In a composite SaaS, it is important to include these elements, as they will directly affect the performance of the SaaS. This paper will propose a Grouping Genetic Algorithm (GGA) for multiple composite SaaS application component clustering in Cloud computing that will address this gap. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to handle multiple composite SaaS reconfiguration placement in a dynamic Cloud environment. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and the scalability of the GGA.",2018,,10.1109/cec.2012.6256562,,publication

A Pipeline for Processing Specimen Images in iDigBio - Applying and Generalizing an Examination of Mercury Use in Preparing Herbarium Specimens,"Yeole, Gaurav, Sahdev, Saniya, Collins, Matthew, Thompson, Alex, Dikow, Rebecca, Frandsen, Paul, Orli, Sylvia, Figueiredo, Renato","<p>iDigBio currently references over 22 million media files, and stores approximately 120 terabytes worth of those media files co-located with our computing infrastructure (Matsunaga et al. 2013). Using these images for scientific research is a logistical and technical challenge. Transferring large numbers of images requires programming skill, bandwidth, and storage space. While simple image transformations such as resizing and generating histograms are approachable on desktops and laptops, the neural networks commonly used for learning from images require server-based graphical processing units (GPUs) to run effectively.</p>
  <p>Using the GUODA (Global Unified Open Data Access) infrastructure, we are building a model pipeline for applying user-defined processing to all or any subset of images stored in iDigBio on servers located in the Advanced Computing and Information Systems lab (ACIS) alongside the iDigBio storage system. This pipeline utilizes Apache Spark, the Hadoop File System (HDFS), and Mesos (Collins et al. 2017). We have placed a Jupyter notebook server in front of this architecture, which provides an easy environment for end users to write their own Python or R software programs. Users can access the stored data and images and manipulate them per their requirements and make their work publicly available on GitHub.</p>
  <p>As an example of how this pipeline can be used in research, we are applying a neural network developed at the Smithsonian Institution to identify herbarium sheets that were prepared with hazardous mercury-containing solutions (Schuettpelz, <em>in preparation</em>). The model was trained on Smithsonian servers using their herbarium images and it is being transferred to the GUODA infrastructure hosted at the ACIS lab. All herbarium images in iDigBio are being classified using this model to illustrate the application of these techniques to larger sets of images using a deep convolutional neural network that detects visible mercury crystallization present on digitized herbarium sheets. Such an automated detection process can potentially be used, for instance, to notify other data publishers of any contamination. We are presenting the results of this classification not as a verified research result, but as an example of the collaborative and scalable workflows this pipeline and infrastructure enable.</p>",2018,"Biocollection Infrastructure, Cloud Computing, Neural Networks, Deep Learning",10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20326,,publication

Orchestrating Your Cloud Orchestra,"Hindle, Abram","Cloud computing potentially ushers in a new era of computer music performance with exceptionally large computer music instruments consisting of 10s to 100s of virtual machines which we propose to call a `cloud-orchestra'. Cloud computing allows for the rapid provisioning of resources, but to deploy such a complicated and interconnected network of software synthesizers in the cloud requires a lot of manual work, system administration knowledge, and developer/operator skills. This is a barrier to computer musicians whose goal is to produce and perform music, and not to administer 100s of computers. This work discusses the issues facing cloud-orchestra deployment and offers an abstract solution and a concrete implementation. The abstract solution is to generate cloud-orchestra deployment plans by allowing computer musicians to model their network of synthesizers and to describe their resources. A model optimizer will compute near-optimal deployment plans to synchronize, deploy, and orchestrate the start-up of a complex network of synthesizers deployed to many computers. This model driven development approach frees computer musicians from much of the hassle of deployment and allocation. Computer musicians can focus on the configuration of musical components and leave the resource allocation up to the modelling software to optimize.",2018,,10.5281/zenodo.1179090,,publication

Towards a Secure Storage in Cloud Computing,"Mohamed Elkholy, Ahmed Elfatatry","Cloud computing has emerged as a flexible computing paradigm that reshaped the Information Technology map. However, cloud computing brought about a number of security challenges as a result of the physical distribution of computational resources and the limited control that users have over the physical storage. This situation raises many security challenges for data integrity and confidentiality as well as authentication and access control. This work proposes a security mechanism for data integrity that allows a data owner to be aware of any modification that takes place to his data. The data integrity mechanism is integrated with an extended Kerberos authentication that ensures authorized access control. The proposed mechanism protects data confidentiality even if data are stored on an untrusted storage. The proposed mechanism has been evaluated against different types of attacks and proved its efficiency to protect cloud data storage from different malicious attacks.",2018,"Access control, data integrity, data confidentiality, Kerberos authentication, cloud security.",10.5281/zenodo.1123945,,publication

New Security Approach of Confidential Resources in Hybrid Clouds,"Haythem Yahyaoui, Samir Moalla, Mounir Bouden, Skander Ghorbel","<p>Nowadays, cloud environments are becoming a need for companies, this new technology gives the opportunities to access to the data anywhere and anytime. It also provides an optimized and secured access to the resources and gives more security for the data which is stored in the platform. However, some companies do not trust Cloud providers, they think that providers can access and modify some confidential data such as bank accounts. Many works have been done in this context, they conclude that encryption methods realized by providers ensure the confidentiality, but, they forgot that Cloud providers can decrypt the confidential resources. The best solution here is to apply some operations on the data before sending them to the provider Cloud in the objective to make them unreadable. The principal idea is to allow user how it can protect his data with his own methods. In this paper, we are going to demonstrate our approach and prove that is more efficient in term of execution time than some existing methods.

Security Issues in Cloud Computing Solution of DDOS and Introducing Two-Tier CAPTCHA,Poonam Yadav1 and Sujata2,"<p>Cloud computing is simply a metaphor for the internet. User does not required knowledge, control, and ownership in the computer infrastructure. User simply access or rent the software and paying only for what they use. Advantage of cloud computing is huge like Broad network access, Cost effectiveness, Rapid elasticity, Measured services, On-Demand service, Resource pooling, Location independence, Reliability, Energy saving and so on. But its global phenomenon that everything in this world has advantage as well as disadvantage, cloud computing also suffering from some drawback like security &amp; privacy, Internet Dependency, Availability, And Current Enterprise Applications Can&#39;t Be Migrated Easily. I conclude that security is biggest hurdle in wide acceptance of cloud computing. User of cloud services are in fear of data loss, security and availability issues.</p>

<p>&nbsp;At virtual level DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service Attack) is biggest threat of availability in cloud computing. In Denial of service attack an attacker prevent legitimate users of service from using the desired resources by flood a network or by consuming bandwidth .So authentication is need to distinguish legitimated clients from malicious clients, which can be performed through strong cryptographic verification (for a private server) or graphical Turing tests (for a public server). Where the authentication is performed by Graphical Turing Tests, which is widely used to distinguish human users from robots through their reaction .</p>

<p>On the other hand, CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) is used for Graphical Turing Test. There are many OCR or Non-OCR based CAPTCHA&rsquo;s are used widely but they are vulnerable to many attacks like Pixel-Count Attack, Recognition by using OCR, Dictionary Attack, and Vertical Segmentation. This paper introduces a new CAPTCHA method called Two-Tier CAPTCHA. In this method CLAD node need to generate two things, first a alphanumeric CAPTCHA code with image. Second Query related to that CAPTCHA code. E.g. enter only Digit&rsquo;s .We can increase the rate of its difficulty in order to improve its resistance against the attacks by adding more and more query and combination in database. The algorithm of this method makes it hard for bot programs which mean that it is more secure.

Performance Evaluation of Parallel Surface Modeling and Generation on Actual and Virtual Multicore Systems,Nyeng P. Gyang,"Even though past, current and future trends suggest that multicore and cloud computing systems are increasingly prevalent/ubiquitous, this class of parallel systems is nonetheless underutilized, in general, and barely used for research on employing parallel Delaunay triangulation for parallel surface modeling and generation, in particular. The performances, of actual/physical and virtual/cloud multicore systems/machines, at executing various algorithms, which implement various parallelization strategies of the incremental insertion technique of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm, were evaluated. <em>T</em>-tests were run on the data collected, in order to determine whether various performance metrics differences (including execution time, speedup and efficiency) were statistically significant. Results show that the actual machine is approximately twice faster than the virtual machine at executing the same programs for the various parallelization strategies. Results, which furnish the scalability behaviors of the various parallelization strategies, also show that some of the differences between the performances of these systems, during different runs of the algorithms on the systems, were statistically significant. A few pseudo superlinear speedup results, which were computed from the raw data collected, are not true superlinear speedup values. These pseudo superlinear speedup values, which arise as a result of one way of computing speedups, disappear and give way to asymmetric speedups, which are the accurate kind of speedups that occur in the experiments performed.",2018,"Cloud computing systems, multicore systems, parallel delaunay triangulation, parallel surface modeling and generation.",10.5281/zenodo.1316161,,publication

consolidation rules are introduced, and a decision model is proposed to
optimally allocate source services to physical target servers while
maximizing the average resource utilization and preference value. Our
model can be regarded as a multi-objective multi-dimension

The evaluation results show the reduction in the virtual machine migrations, the increase of efficiency and the reduction of energy consumption.</p>",2018,"Energy Consumption, Virtual Machine Placement, Harmony Search Algorithm, Server Consolidation,, Binpacking Problem",10.5121/ijccsa.2016.6401,,publication
Creation of a Care Robot Impact Assessment,E. Fosch-Villaronga,"This paper pioneers Care Robot Impact Assessment
(CRIA), a methodology used to identify, analyze, mitigate and
eliminate the risks posed by the insertion of non-medical personal
care robots (PCR) in medical care facilities. Its precedent instruments
[Privacy and Surveillance Impact Assessment (PIA and SIA)] fall
behind in coping with robots. Indeed, personal care robots change
dramatically how care is delivered. The paper presents a specific
risk-sector methodology, identifies which robots are under its scope
and presents some of the challenges introduced by these robots.",2018,"Ethics, Impact Assessment, Law, Personal Care

Modeling Bessel Beams and Their Discrete Superpositions from the Generalized Lorenz-Mie Theory to Calculate Optical Forces over Spherical Dielectric Particles,"Leonardo A. Ambrosio, Carlos. H. Silva Santos, Ivan E. L. Rodrigues, Ayumi K. de Campos, Leandro A. Machado","In this work, we propose an algorithm developed under Python language for the modeling of ordinary scalar Bessel beams and their discrete superpositions and subsequent calculation of optical forces exerted over dielectric spherical particles. The mathematical formalism, based on the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory, is implemented in Python for its large number of free mathematical (as SciPy and NumPy), data visualization (Matplotlib and PyJamas) and multiprocessing libraries. We also propose an approach, provided by a synchronized Software as Service (SaaS) in cloud computing, to develop a user interface embedded on a mobile application, thus providing users with the necessary means to easily introduce desired unknowns and parameters and see the graphical outcomes of the simulations right at their mobile devices. Initially proposed as a free Android-based application, such an App enables data post-processing in cloud-based architectures and visualization of results, figures and numerical tables.",2018,,10.5281/zenodo.1339039,,publication
Performance Assessment of Multi-Level Ensemble for Multi-Class Problems,"Rodolfo Lorbieski, Silvia Modesto Nassar","Many supervised machine learning tasks require<br>
decision making across numerous different classes. Multi-class<br>
classification has several applications, such as face recognition, text<br>
recognition and medical diagnostics. The objective of this article is<br>
to analyze an adapted method of Stacking in multi-class problems,<br>
which combines ensembles within the ensemble itself. For this<br>
purpose, a training similar to Stacking was used, but with three<br>
levels, where the final decision-maker (level 2) performs its training<br>
by combining outputs from the tree-based pair of meta-classifiers<br>
(level 1) from Bayesian families. These are in turn trained by pairs<br>
of base classifiers (level 0) of the same family. This strategy seeks to<br>
promote diversity among the ensembles forming the meta-classifier<br>
level 2. Three performance measures were used: (1) accuracy, (2)<br>
area under the ROC curve, and (3) time for three factors: (a)<br>
datasets, (b) experiments and (c) levels. To compare the factors,<br>
ANOVA three-way test was executed for each performance measure,<br>
considering 5 datasets by 25 experiments by 3 levels. A triple<br>
interaction between factors was observed only in time. The accuracy<br>
and area under the ROC curve presented similar results, showing<br>
a double interaction between level and experiment, as well as for<br>
the dataset factor. It was concluded that level 2 had an average<br>
performance above the other levels and that the proposed method<br>
is especially efficient for multi-class problems when compared to<br>
binary problems.",2018,"Stacking, multi-layers, ensemble, multi-class.",10.5281/zenodo.1316043,,publication
THE REALIZATION OPPORTUNITY OF IDEAL ENERGY SYSTEM USING NANOTECHNOLOGY BASED RESEARCH AND INNOVATIONS,"Shubhrajyotsna Aithal, P. S. Aithal","<p>An energy system is primarily designed to produce or convert and deliver energy for useful work. It supports the dynamic functions of the people both for their basic needs and luxurious wants. Out of many energy sources used in practice, renewable energy sources are finding importance due to their inherent ability to support a sustainable world. The challenges of developing such an efficient system can be handled effectively by considering the model and the characteristics of the ideal energy system. In our previous paper, we have developed a model and identified about 34 characteristics of an ideal energy system as a predictive hypothetical system and discussed the possibility of developing at least optimum energy system using suitable technology. In this paper, we made an attempt to use nanotechnology, one of the two universal technologies of the 21<sup>st</sup> century to realize many characteristics of an ideal energy system. We also proposed and analysed the possibility of using some nonlinear Dye Sensitized Nanocomposite doped Polymer Films in the process of designing highly efficient, low cost solar energy to electric energy converters. This predictive analysis opens up various research possibilities of nanomaterials usage in developing optimum energy systems towards the objective of achieving ideal energy system.</p>",2018,"Energy, System, Ideal Energy System, Renewable Energy Systems & Nanotechnology",10.5281/zenodo.2521570,,publication
