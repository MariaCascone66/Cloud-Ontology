Automating Cloud Security and Compliance at Scale Strategies and Best Practices,"Rajashekar Reddy Yasani, Karthik Venkatesh Ratnam","<p><span>Many rules, guidelines, and software controls have been developed by various agencies and standards bodies throughout the world to address data protection concerns, and they are all meant to be applied to data stored in the Cloud. Compliance obligations have so increased for service providers who store private information about their end users. It takes a lot of human work to follow these rules because they aren't in a machine-processable format. Providers often have to put in extra work to meet all of the regulations because numerous laws have similar requirements but don't mention each other. Every single data protection regulation that pertains to data stored in the cloud has been thoroughly researched by us. We have created a knowledge graph that incorporates all of these data compliance rules and is rich in semantic information. This encompasses both the data threats and the necessary security policies to lessen those risks. In this work, we showcase this knowledge graph and the evaluation system we built in great detail. We have checked our knowledge graph with the privacy policies of several cloud providers, including Rackspace, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and IBM. Businesses may automate their compliance procedures and establish enterprise-level Cloud security rules with the help of this publicly-available knowledge graph.</span></p>",2024,"Cloud computing, cloud security, security domains, security compliance models, cloud security models",10.5281/zenodo.13912688,,publication

Infrastructure for scientific research and collaboration should embrace this structure to make science more productive and inclusive. For the Year of Open Science, NASA and other federal funding agencies have begun to transition their data stores and computing into the cloud to make them more transparent, reproducible, and accessible. However, to accomplish research goals and fully leverage new cloud capabilities, substantial barriers exist for individual users to make the transition from their local systems to the cloud, including: estimating cloud costs, infrastructure deployment complexity, and a general lack of community awareness and knowledge.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, we have built, in partnership with the International Interactive Computing Collaboration and funded by the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission and NASA ICESat-2 Project Science Office, a persistent JupyterHub called CryoCloud (cryointhecloud.com) designed for cryosphere science research communities. We rolled out our persistent hub space across a series of conference, workshop, and hackathon events to help the NASA ICESat-2 Science Team and other NASA cryosphere researchers build community and transition to a collaborative cloud workspace. We gathered user data from over 160 scientists in the first nine months of the project to understand the cloud needs of researchers. Our community is enabled by cloud and software expertise provided as a service. Familiar, easy-to-use, and modular software enables the infrastructure customization required to meet the needs of a specialized community of practice. Openly shared knowledge and code reduce research and computing overhead while accelerating collaboration and feedback among scientists. We share examples of how these cloud tools and community best practices make scientific computing more intuitive, cost- and time-efficient, and open for all. CryoCloud provides a transferable community model for building a research community while enabling learning and curation of the technical knowledge required to facilitate NASA&rsquo;s open-source, interconnected, and science-accelerated vision of the future.</p>",2024,"cloud computing, open science, jupyter, jupyterhub, NASA",10.5281/zenodo.10633254,,presentation

Consequences of Enterprise Cloud Migration on Institutional Information Technology Knowledge,Dr.A.Shaji George,"<p><span>As enterprise adoption of cloud computing accelerates, driven by desires to reduce costs and improve agility, IT departments face an unintended consequence - the gradual erosion of internal expertise related to on-premises systems. Surveys indicate 80% of companies have migrated major systems to the cloud, projecting 90% adoption by 2025. While touting benefits like reduced capital expenses and faster provisioning, the reality is many organizations are dependent on external cloud vendors for mission-critical services they no longer fully understand. This knowledge drain regarding legacy infrastructure and applications has left IT teams without the specialized skills to optimize performance, strengthen security, or even adequately evaluate vendor offerings. Analysis shows 70% of IT staff lack deep expertise with cloud platforms and modern devOps tools after migration, struggling to adapt. Entire administrative and troubleshooting tasks around server clusters, data centers, and networks have been ceded to third parties. Though some skills remain transferable, few cloud architects grasp intricacies of the organization's aging ERP system or database infrastructure; this increases risk of issues during any hybrid cloud transition. As veteran staffers with operations experience retire, replacement hires versed in application integration and container orchestration hardly fill the gap. This skill deficit leaves institutions vulnerable when the cloud fails, unable to diagnose internal causes or vendor SLA violations. Outages at leading providers like AWS and Azure have caused significant disruption, while misconfigurations account for nearly 80% of breaches; without in-house technical knowledge, resolving these problems relies entirely on outside support. Delays and downtime can cost millions. Facing this complexity gap, IT leaders must make reskilling existing teams a priority, rather than continued layoffs, while mandating documentation of legacy platforms and processes before that expertise permanently dissipates. Though the cloud journey has lifted basic burdens, organizations must take care not to outsource their entire technological competency along the way.</span></p>",2024,"Cloud migration, Legacy systems, Knowledge drain, IT skills gap, Hybrid infrastructure, Multi-cloud, Reskilling, Vendor lock-in, Cloud outages, Digital transformation.",10.5281/zenodo.10938874,,publication

Load Balancing Strategies in Heterogeneous Environments,"Wang, Lun, Fang, Wei, Du, Yudi","<p>In the realm of network systems, load balancing plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient resource utilization and maintaining optimal performance levels. As network environments become increasingly heterogeneous, characterized by a wide range of hardware capabilities, operating systems, and application requirements, the challenge of achieving effective load balancing becomes more complex. This paper explores various load balancing strategies specifically designed for heterogeneous environments, providing a comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness through both theoretical frameworks and experimental evaluations.<br>The study begins by categorizing load balancing techniques into static and dynamic approaches, examining their fundamental principles and operational mechanisms. Static load balancing techniques, such as Weighted Round Robin, are assessed for their simplicity and ease of implementation, while dynamic techniques, like Adaptive Load Balancing, are evaluated for their ability to respond to real-time changes in the network environment.<br>To rigorously evaluate these strategies, a simulation framework is developed, replicating a heterogeneous network environment with nodes of varying processing power, memory, and network bandwidth. This framework allows for controlled experimentation, where different load balancing algorithms are applied to a variety of workload scenarios, ranging from compute-intensive to I/O-bound tasks.<br>Experimental data, meticulously generated and analyzed, provide critical insights into the performance metrics of each strategy, including response time, throughput, and resource utilization. These metrics are crucial for understanding the practical implications of each load balancing approach, guiding network administrators and system architects in selecting the most appropriate strategy for their specific needs.<br>The findings of this study not only highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each load balancing technique but also offer recommendations for optimizing load distribution in heterogeneous environments. By bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and practical implementation, this paper aims to contribute to the development of more robust and efficient network systems capable of meeting the demands of increasingly diverse and complex applications.</p>",2024,"Load Balancing, Heterogeneous Environments, Network Performance, Scalability, Resource Allocation, Dynamic Load Distribution, Fault Tolerance, Traffic Management, Virtualization, Cloud Computing, Algorithm Optimization, Service Reliability, Performance Metrics, Adaptive Strategies, Distributed Systems",10.5281/zenodo.12599358,,publication

"MorphoBank: phylophenomics in the ""cloud""","O'Leary, Maureen A., Kaufman, Seth","(Uploaded by Plazi for the Bat Literature Project) A highly interoperable informatics infrastructure rapidly emerged to handle genomic data used for phylogenetics and was instrumental in the growth of molecular systematics. Parallel growth in software and databases to address needs peculiar to phylophenomics has been relatively slow and fragmented. Systematists currently face the challenge that Earth may hold tens of millions of species (living and fossil) to be described and classified. Grappling with research on this scale has increasingly resulted in work by teams, many constructing large phenomic supermatrices. Until now, phylogeneticists have managed data in single-user, filebased desktop software wholly unsuitable for real-time, team-based collaborative work. Furthermore, phenomic data often differ from genomic data in readily lending themselves to media representation (e.g. 2D and 3D images, video, sound). Phenomic data are a growing component of phylogenetics, and thus teams require the ability to record homology hypotheses using media and to share and archive these data. Here we describe MorphoBank, a web application and database leveraging software as a service methodology compatible with ''cloud'' computing technology for the construction of matrices of phenomic data. In its tenth year, and fully available to the scientific community at-large since inception, MorphoBank enables interactive collaboration not possible with desktop software, permitting self-assembling teams to develop matrices, in real time, with linked media in a secure web environment. MorphoBank also provides any user with tools to build character and media ontologies (rule sets) within matrices, and to display these as directed acyclic graphs. These rule sets record the phylogenetic interrelatedness of characters (e.g. if X is absent, Y is inapplicable, or X–Z characters share a media view). MorphoBank has enabled an order of magnitude increase in phylophenomic data collection: a recent collaboration by more than 25 researchers has produced a database of &gt; 4500 phenomic characters supported by &gt; 10 000 media.",2024,"Biodiversity, Mammalia, Chiroptera, Chordata, Animalia, bats, bat",10.5281/zenodo.13521770,,publication
Enabling DevOps for Fog Applications in the Smart Manufacturing domain: A Model-Driven based Platform Engineering approach,"Cuadra, Julen, Hurtado, Ekaitz, Sarachaga, Isabel, Estévez, Elisabet, Casquero, Oskar, Armentia, Aintzane","<p>Cloud Computing is revolutionizing smart manufacturing by offering on-demand and scalable computer systems that facilitate plant data analysis and operational efficiency optimization. DevOps is a methodology, widely used for developing Cloud Computing systems, that streamlines software development by improving its integration, delivery, and deployment.

The deployment environment is also relevant since, as such applications are often hosted in the Fog, the proliferation of application components may hinder their composition and validation. This work is aimed at embracing the Platform Engineering approach to provide a tailored toolkit that guides the design and development of OpenFog compliant applications for the experts in the Smart Manufacturing domain. The platform uses Model Driven Engineering techniques and a flow-based visual editor to allow application designers to graphically compose applications from components previously delivered by component developers, abstracting them from the underlying technologies.

Quantum Circuit Optimization of Arithmetic Circuits using ZX Calculus,Reena Monica P,"<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum computing is an emerging technology in which quantum mechanical properties are suitably utilized to perform certain compute-intensive operations faster than classical computers. Quantum algorithms are designed as a combination of quantum circuits that each require a large number of quantum gates, which is a challenge considering the limited number of qubit resources available in quantum computing systems. Our work proposes a technique to optimize quantum arithmetic algorithms by reducing the hardware resources and the number of qubits based on ZX calculus. We have utilized ZX calculus rewrite rules for the optimization of fault-tolerant quantum multiplier circuits where we are able to achieve a significant reduction in the number of ancilla bits and T-gates as compared to the originally required numbers to achieve fault-tolerance. Our work is the first step in the series of arithmetic circuit optimization using graphicalrewrite tools and it pavesthe way for advancing the optimization of various complex quantum circuits and establishing the potential for new applications of the same.</p>",2024,"Circuit Optimization, Quantum Circuit, Quantum Computing, T-count, ZX-calculus",10.35940/ijitee.B9794.13020124,,publication

Students' acceptance of learning management system: Analysis of responses based on generational differences,"Syafri, Mohamad, Dewi, Jayanti Puspita","<p>The dynamic improvement of technology has led the world to move at lightning speed, affecting aspects of human life, including education. The Learning Management System (LMS) is one of the crucial technologies nowadays, especially during and post-COVID-19. Prior studies have explored this subject, including seeing the user's responses. However, little of the study could have a vast range with various background users as most education institutions are unlikely to have students from too heterogeneous backgrounds, especially age. Thus, this study aims to see how people from different generations, namely Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z, respond to the LMS application. The study took place at Universitas Terbuka, one of the universities that implemented distance learning in their learning process. The 23-question adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model of Davis was designed and sent to students of Universitas Terbuka using Google Forms. Two main aspects of technology acceptance, behavior, and technology usefulness were the focus. Kendall&rsquo;s Tau formula was utilized to analyze the obtained survey data. The findings show that all generations respond well to technology: Generation X (2,04/2,15), Millenials (1,90/1,94), and Generation Z (2,07/2,17). The further analysis explained that there was no correlation between age and technology acceptance for behavior towards technology (0,964) and usefulness (0,886). The research result is believed to help educators and stakeholders maximize the use of technology in education.

The Metamorphosis of Work: How Technology is Transforming the Employee Experience from Industrial to Digital,Dr.A.Shaji George,"<p><span>The nature of work and the employee experience are undergoing a metamorphosis, transitioning away from the rigid structures and norms of the industrial era towards the flexible and democratized environs of the digital age. This research paper explores the key dimensions of this transformation through a comparative analysis of industrial and digital-era work models. The industrial work paradigm is characterized by regimented schedules, corporate office locales, knowledge hoarding, hierarchical career ladders, impersonal communications, and an emphasis on input metrics over outputs. In contrast, the emerging digital model offers employees increased autonomy over when and where they work via flexible schedules and remote options. Career paths are self-directed rather than confined to pre-defined corporate ladders. Information flows openly across peer networks, supported by collaborative technologies that enable rich communication. The focus has shifted from inputs to outcomes, with results determining success over merely putting in time. Several intertwined factors are catalyzing this metamorphosis. Pivotal are ongoing technological innovations, such as mobile devices, collaborative software, cloud computing, and AI/automation, which dismantle spatial and temporal boundaries while empowering individual workers. Generational mindset shifts also play a role, as Millennials and Gen Zer&rsquo;s expect meaningful, flexible work and continuous learning. Moreover, globalized, hyper-competitive markets pressure companies to rapidly adapt, fueling flatter, more agile organizational forms. This transformation poses new challenges for employers and employees alike. Organizations must rethink how they manage remote workers, facilitate ongoing peer learning, measure performance based on outputs, and nurture engagement and inclusion in virtual environments. Similarly, employees must adapt to self-directed career management, learn digital era skills, embrace risk, and find purpose and community in more dispersed networks. While acknowledging potential growing pains, the research suggests the metamorphosis towards digitally enabled employee experiences holds significant promise. Knowledge work stands to become more creative, fulfilling, and human centered. This paper synthesizes current scholarship on the changing nature of work in the digital age while proposing frameworks to guide organizations and individuals through the workplace metamorphosis already underway. The onset of a new era is disruptive, yet by understanding its contours, we gain agency to shape its trajectory in humanistic and socially conscious ways.</span></p>",2024,"Digital transformation, Workplace evolution, Human-centric work, Remote work, Automation, Employee empowerment, Self-directed careers, Knowledge sharing, Agile management, Continuous learning.",10.5281/zenodo.10673376,,publication

The Abandonment of the Assignment of Subject Headings and Classification Codes in University Libraries Due to the Massive Emergence of Electronic Books,"Gil-Leiva, Isidoro, Spotti Lopes Fujita, Mariângela, Díaz Ortuño, Pedro, Dos Reis, Daniela Majorie","<p>The massive and unstoppable emergence of electronic books in libraries has altered their organization. This disruptive technology has led to structural changes. Currently, an e-book exists only if its metadata exists. The objective of this article is to analyse the impact that the massive incorporation of electronic books in university library systems is having in the processes of assignment of subject headings and classification codes. We carried out a survey of more than six hundred libraries, which means almost all the university libraries in Portugal, Spain, England, United States, Brazil, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Australia. From the results obtained, it is deduced that: 1) librarians expect e books to be provided with descriptive metadata related to the subject headings and classification codes; 2) the biblio graphic records provided by publishers/providers seem to be improvable; 3) the quality of the metadata provided by the providers does not seem to be taken into account when selecting publishers for the purchase; 4) the discovery tools are also clearly improvable; 5) it seems that there is no &ldquo;frustration&rdquo; or &ldquo;stress&rdquo; among librarians about the changes produced in relation to technical processes; and, 6) it does not seem that we are facing a paradigm shift motivated by these issues.</p>",2024,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-8-646,,publication

Landscape Dynamics and Environmental Fragility Zoning in Hinh River Basin: Insights for protecting natural ecosystems,"Nguyen, Quoc Khanh, Tong, Hanh, Nguyen, Liem, Nguyen, Thu Nga, Ngo, Trung Dung, Hong Quang, Nguyen, Dinh, Anh Tu, Pham, Mai-Phuong","<p>The landscapes in the Hinh River Basin are crucial and highly sensitive to climate change for the coastal province of Phu Yen and the entire south-central coastal region of Vietnam, offering vital environmental services to its downstream areas. Hinh River Basin has a rich system of rivers and streams and abundant surface water resources. However, it remains one of the region's top localities at risk and a very vulnerable region. This study aims to evaluate the changes in landscape (LC) over 10 years (2010-2023) and predict LC over the next six years using machine-learning (ML) algorithms on Google Earth Engine. To achieve these study goals, we establish: (i) potential environmental fragility (PEF) levels based on: terrain slope; geological domains; river hierarchy; percentage of sand in soil; annual mean precipitations; and (ii) emergent environmental fragility (EEF) levels through the addition of LC parameter to model. The methodology includes integrating the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) into a Geographic Information System (GIS). Results show that three LC types (water, annual industrial crop, forest) are related to extremely high EEF. The predictive model suggests that, by 2030, the forest and annual industrial crop LCs in the study area will increase by around 20%. The analysis results show that there has been an increase in the area of planted forests, which can confirm the futher effectiveness of agricultural, forestry, afforestation and forest protection programmes in the study area (Plan for the implementation of forestry development strategy for the period 2021-2030, with a vision to 2050, Phu Yen Province, No 126/KH-UBND 13/7/2021; and Decision on the approval of the project for planting 15 million trees in Phu Yen Province for the period 2021-2025, No 1646/QĐ-UBND 16/11/2021).</p>",2024,"landscape, dynamic, environmental fragility, Google Earth Engine, MCA",10.3897/oneeco.9.e134088,,publication

A Comparative Analysis of Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree Algorithm for Predicting Fault in Uninterruptible Power Supply Systems,Dr. Benjamin Odoi,"<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Power supply systems can have problems, and Ghana Gas Limited is not an exception. Ghana Gas Limited uses an intricate Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system which is made up of several parts such as electromechanical components, PCB boards, and electrolytic capacitors. The majority of components have technical lifespans that are governed by usage, operational environment, and working conditions, such as electrical stress, working hours, and working cycles. Most of the time, these errors affect the integrity and power supply after manufacture. The issue is that it takes longer for the professionals who operate on this machine to recognize these flaws, which makes it difficult for them to predict errors quickly or anticipate the likelihood of faults happening in the system components at an early stage for effective corrective action to be performed. Support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees were used in this study to anticipate faultsfortechnical data scheduling of uninterruptible power supply systems for Ghana Gas Limited in an efficient manner. Based on a comparative analysis using these two techniques, faults in Ghana Gas Limited's power supply system were predicted using a four-hour daily interval dataset on UPS recordings, including input voltage, battery voltage, battery current, and alarm, spanning from August 2017 to October 2023. The findings depicted that the support vector machine was more efficient in detecting the fault locations in the power supply system with an accuracy of 96.80%, recall of 99.80%, precision of 100 %, F1-score of 93.15%. The results from the error metrics also validate the measures in assessing the predictive ability of the model with MAE of 0.42%, MSE of 1.18%, RMSE of 4.45%, R2 of 99.97%, RMSLE of 0.036%, and MAPE of 0.21%.</p>",2024,"Power Supply System, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Algorithm, Precision, Accuracy, Error Metrics",10.35940/ijitee.F9871.13060524,,publication

Graph Query Language: A Data Consolidation Layer,Khirod Chandra Panda,"<p><span><span>API integration is a crucial aspect of modern software development, enabling smooth communication between applications and external services. Among the various integration methods available, GraphQL has emerged as a powerful API query language, offering flexibility and efficiency in retrieving data. This article aims to explore API integration using GraphQL in-depth, covering its core concepts, advantages over traditional REST APIs, implementation strategies, best practices, real-world use cases, and its future in software development. GraphQL revolutionizes the way APIs are queried and executed. Unlike traditional REST APIs, which limit clients' control over the data they receive, GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they require. This approach reduces unnecessary data fetching, leading to more effective communication between clients and servers. In a GraphQL Web API, a GraphQL schema defines the types of data objects that can be queried, while resolver functions fetch the relevant data from underlying sources based on the queries. This architecture not only enables efficient data access but also facilitates data integration. When the GraphQL schema accurately represents the semantics of data from various sources, and resolver functions can retrieve and structure data accordingly, GraphQL can act as a unified interface for accessing and integrating diverse data sources. However, current approaches to GraphQL for data integration lack semantic awareness and formal methods for defining GraphQL APIs based on ontologies. To bridge this gap, a framework is proposed in which a global domain ontology guides the generation of a GraphQL server. This framework includes an algorithm for generating a GraphQL schema based on ontology and generic resolver functions based on semantic mappings.</span></span></p>",2024,"Batching, Data, DoS, GraphQL, Introspection, Mutation, Query, Schema",10.5281/zenodo.11089895,,publication

A Review on Business Intelligence for Small and Midsize Businesses (SMBS),Pranay Mungara,"<p><span>Every single organization is confronted with an enormous number of obstacles, but this is especially true for small and medium-sized organizations who are seeking to grow with traditional technologies. Therefore, in order for organizations to be successful in overcoming the challenges, they need to implement business intelligence by utilizing the management of information technology systems. This study proposes a conceptual framework that identifies the potential factors that influence the adoption of business intelligence systems in the context of the small and medium-sized company (SME) sector in Libya. The SME sector is a sector that is comprised of small and medium-sized businesses. Two key concepts that served as the basis for this research effort were the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the unified theory of adopting and using technology (UTAUT). Both of these models were developed by the National Institute of Technology (NIST). This research suggested a conceptual framework that would incorporate a number of different aspects, such as the management of change, the sharing of knowledge, the quality of information, the management of business intelligence projects, the perceived usefulness of a business intelligence system (BIS), and the perceived simplicity of adopting a BIS. The findings of earlier research that explored this kind of influence are consistent with this proposal, which is in accordance with those findings. This study did not take into account the impact that environmental factors have on the adoption of a business intelligence system (BIS). This is because individual small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have their own distinct features in terms of the sector or industry type in which they operate.</span></p>",2024,"small and medium-sized organizations, business intelligence systems, technology acceptance model (TAM)",10.5281/zenodo.12787725,,publication
New Trends in Web Mining for Business Companies Using Cloud Mining (Bit Coin),"Dr. K. John Peter, K. Senbagam, E. Dilip Kumar","<p><span>In this work, we present research on the extraction of important knowledge from online mining through cloud mining in corporate enterprises, along with a comparative analysis of web mining. This essay provides examples of current, past, and future cloud-based web mining. We are now starting to use real-time datasets to recover network facts (web content mining) and identify client-server approach relationships (web management mining), which improve web mining issues. Furthermore, we used cloud mining in corporate organizations to illustrate online mining in a similar way. An emerging form of web mining is cloud mining. The primary advantage of the company handling all common mining issues is that. Operating a mining rig has associated costs that are reduced by cloud mining. Cloud mining is a process that uses rented cloud computing to mine crypto currencies like bit coin without immediately controlling or connecting the related hardware and software. The process continues when the first processor to notice a solution to the issue captures the next Bit coin block. For complex computations and arithmetic problems to be explained, Bit coin mining requires sophisticated technology. We have covered to work and is advantageous for business companies in this paper. A cloud mining service's structure is what we've suggested. Business plan and strategy, hardware acquisition and configuration, dashboard and user interface, customer service and training, etc., all support these services. Deals for cloud mining services are frequently deceptive or fraudulent. Suppliers and businesses involved in cloud mining profit from leasing their hardware in exchange for cash. Trading mining gear appears to be a way for prospects to save money.</span></p>",2024,,10.5281/zenodo.13193771,,publication
AI in drug discovery and its clinical relevance,"Qureshi, R., Irfan, M., Gondal, T., Khan, Sh., Wu, J., Hadi, M., Heymach, J., Le, X., Yan, H., Alam, T.","<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for novel drug discovery process. However, the journey from conceptualizing a drug to its eventual implementation in clinical settings is a long, complex, and expensive process, with many potential points of failure. Over the past decade, a vast growth in medical information has coincided with advances in computational hardware (cloud computing, GPUs, and TPUs) and the rise of deep learning. Medical data generated from large molecular screening profiles, personal health or pathology records, and public health organizations could benefit from analysis by Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to speed up and prevent failures in the drug discovery pipeline. We present applications of AI at various stages of drug discovery pipelines, including the inherently computational approaches of&nbsp;<em>de novo</em> design and prediction of a drug's likely properties. Open-source databases and AI-based software tools that facilitate drug design are discussed along with their associated problems of molecule representation, data collection, complexity, labeling, and disparities among labels. How contemporary AI methods, such as graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and generated models, along with structure-based methods, (i.e., molecular dynamics simulations and molecular docking) can contribute to drug discovery applications and analysis of drug responses is also explored. Finally, recent developments and investments in AI-based start-up companies for biotechnology, drug design and their current progress, hopes and promotions are discussed in this article.</p>",2024,"Artificial intelligence, Biotechnology, Graph neural networks, Molecule representation, Reinforcement learning, Drug discovery, Molecular dynamics simulation",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e17575,,publication
