Semantic SLA for Clouds: Combining SLAC and OWL-Q,"Kyriakos Kritikos, Rafael Brundo Uriarte","<p>Several SLA languages have been proposed, some specifically for the cloud domain. However, after extensively<br>
analysing the domain’s requirements considering the SLA lifecycle, we conclude that none of them covers the<br>
necessary aspects for application in diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose SSLAC, where we<br>
combine the capabilities of two prominent service specification and SLA languages: OWL-Q and SLAC. These<br>
languages have different scopes but complementary features. SLAC is domain specific with validation and<br>
verification capabilities. OWL-Q is a higher level language based on ontologies and well defined semantics.<br>
Their combination advances the state of the art in many perspectives. It enables the SLA’s semantic verification<br>
and inference and, at the same time, its constraint-based modelling and enforcement. It also provides a complete<br>
formal approach for defining non-functional terms and an enforcement framework covering real-world scenarios.<br>
The advantages of SSLAC, in terms of expressiveness and features, are then shown in a use case modelled by it.</p>",2017,"SLA, Cloud Computing",10.5281/zenodo.1001162,,publication
Providing a New Model for Discovering Cloud Services Based on Ontology,"Heydari, B., Aajami, M.","<p>Due to its efficient, flexible, and dynamic substructure in information technology and service quality parameters estimation, cloud computing has become one of the most important issues in computer world. Discovering cloud services has been posed as a fundamental issue in reaching out high efficiency. In order to do one&rsquo;s own operations in cloud space, any user needs to request several various services either simultaneously or according to a working routine. These services can be presented by different cloud producers or different decision-making policies. Therefore, service management is one of the important and challenging issues in cloud computing. With the advent of semantic web and practical services accordingly in cloud computing space, access to different kinds of applications has become possible. Ontology is the core of semantic web and can be used to ease the process of discovering services. A new model based on ontology has been proposed in this paper. The results indicate that the proposed model has explored cloud services based on user search results in lesser time compared to other models.</p>",2017,"cloud, computing, service, semantic, web, ontology",10.5281/zenodo.1118362,,publication
Proposing New Intelligent  System for Suggesting Better  Service Providers in Cloud  Computing based on Kalman  Filtering,"Darbandi, Mehdi","<p>There are lots of different companies which present IT services to the users and other companies.

A CROMLECH EDITION OF CLOUD COMPUTING FRAMEWORK USING CONCEPT OF ONTOLOGY WITH QUERY RETRIEVAL AND REFINEMENT MECHANISM,Navita,"<p>We all are living in the world of clouds. User has become adaptive to latest technology trends of information and communication technologies. Cloud computing has made our lives practical and keeps providing us services like consulting, data management and storage in efficient way. Cloud computing is one of emerging areas that is prevailing in industries at grandiose rate. It is combination of Internet and centralized network servers forming a mesh called CLOUD. In this paper, various aspects of cloud computing and its applications are presented. Some differences are provided between network models of cloud computing that are governing organizations and enterprisers. For achieving fault tolerance strategy, there is need to introduce multiple clouds and resource management architecture.</p>

<p>It is believed that existing model must be improved time to time to ensure efficient computing of tasks. The paper presents an improved version of cloud computing detailed architecture. It lists deficiencies between existing cloud information architecture and proposed ontology based architecture. Two additional modules have been introduced in model viz Query Retrieval and Query Refinement. Refinement of queries is done using Rocchio formula that extracts results based on relevance criteria i.e. by distinguishing relevant and non relevant results. They are introduced in order to get efficient indexed results after transforming user query.</p>",2017,"Cloud computing, Deployment models, Query Retrieval and Refinement Mechanism.",10.5281/zenodo.886882,,publication
A Semantically-Enhanced Modelling Environment for Business Process as a Service,"Knut Hinkelmann, Sabrina Kurjakovic, Benjamin Lammel, Emanuele Laurenzi, Robert Woitsch","<p>In this paper we present a hybrid modeling approach which supports the continuous alignment of business and IT in the cloud. Business Process as a Service provides the end-to-end cloud support for business processes instead of single applications. A graphical modelling environment allows non-technical modelers to design business processes and to specify requirements in human-interpretable way. Via semantic lifting, the graphical models can be annotated with classes and values from an enterprise ontology. The BPaaS Ontology contains the relevant classes for the smart Business and IT-Cloud alignment. It supports the modeler in using a standard terminology and thus ensures consistent modeling. </p>",2017,"semantic lifting, enterprise modelling, business process as a service, cloud computing",10.5281/zenodo.250875,,publication
Secure Online Cloud Data Storage System Using Blowfish Algorithm,N.Jayapandian,"<p>The Government set aside several relief schemes for people, who are affecting in natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, cyclones and so on. The relief funds aided for the people those who are suffering in disaster. Initially, this endowment is helpful for surfers to get their basic necessary services. The benefits of this fund are transacted to sufferers through officers or politicians. But, these funds are not properly reached to the correct hands. Those funds are misused and corrupted by wrong persons. Because, the duplication of the government proofs like ration card, voter id, and so on are getting easily to corrupt the fund. To overcome that, we enhance some security levels for fund transaction through online using cloud computing. The three security levels of the proposed schemes are data collection, encryption and face detection. First, users must sign up or create an account in the relief fund transaction form. After that, the user should submit the details like family, bank details, documents that listed in that module. This submission is saved in cloud server, so it could be taken or seen from anywhere. Second, the submitted details are encrypted for more protection. Third, the user face must be detected using web cameras. All these levels is processed under a service level agreement (SLA); it is the contract between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the customer. The service provider must give assurance that, the above documents that the user submitted in cloud server will not be corrupted by any hackers. These three layers are called as tri-level security. The proposed design supports continued safe and efficient security measures, including uploaded proofs, encrypted data, and detect consumer face. By using our proposed system, hackers cannot get the money only the authorized person can receive the fund. So that, the rate of corruption will be low and also the funds will properly reach the sufferer people. Here we use Blowfish algorithm for encryption process, also we compare blowfish and hash chain algorithm. The proposed scheme the combination of face detection and blowfish algorithm give highest security level for cloud environments.</p>",2017,"Blowfish algorithm, Hash Chain algorithm, Cloud Computing, Encryption, Data Storage.",10.5281/zenodo.918341,,publication
INDIAN SMEs MAKE THE MOST OF CLOUD – A SURVEY BASED ANALYSIS ON CLOUD USAGE,"Monisha Singh*1, C. Suresh Kumar2","<p>Cloud computing is an internet-based computing which lets users acquire knowledge, products and services they need for business. In developing countries, SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) are the nurturing grounds for entrepreneurs and major contributors of economic growth. Indian enterprises are gradually changing their perception of IT (Information Technology) by adopting the flexible and global way of accessing data anytime and anywhere. This paper investigates the usage of cloud computing by SMEs in India. The study involves quantitative techniques for collecting and analysing data from 120 SMEs that have adopted cloud computing as their business strategy. These SMEs belong to various sectors including finance, education, government, healthcare, IT, etc., from 6 cities of India. The findings reveal that majority of SMEs demand services of cloud. But at the same time, it is also found that SMEs are more worried about security, interoperability and vendor lock-in issues of cloud as these services are accessed over internet. As cloud computing evolves, more SMEs in India may adopt it as a default method of IT delivery and consequently remove the barriers of the digital divide in developing countries.</p>",2017,"Cloud Adoption, Cloud Computing, Cloud Usage, Indian SMEs.",10.5281/zenodo.834565,,publication
DocCloud: A document recommender system on cloud computing with plausible deniability,"Vera del Campo, Juan, Pegueroles, Josep, Hernández Serrano, Juan, Soriano, Miguel","<p>Recommender systems select the most interesting products for costumers based on their interests. The move of a recommender system to a cloud faces many challenges from the perspective of the protection of the participants. Little work has been done regarding secure recommender systems or how to cope with the legal liability of the cloud provider and any virtual machine inside the cloud. We propose DocCloud, a recommender system that focused on the protection of all participants against legal attacks. We present the architecture of DocCloud and analyze the security mechanisms that the system includes. Specifically, we study the properties of plausible deniability and anonymity of the recommenders and intermediate nodes.

CLOUD SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE - A SEMANTIC APPROACH IN END TO END SECURITY,"Kalaiprasath, R., Elankavi, R., Udayakumar, R.","The Cloud services are becoming an essential part of many organizations. Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology.",2017,"Cloud computing, cloud security, Security compliance models, Cloud security models.",10.21307/ijssis-2017-265,,publication
ScipionCloud: An integrative and interactive gateway for large scale cryo electron microscopy image processing on commercial and academic clouds,"Cuenca Alba, Jesus, del Cano, Laura, Gomez Blanco, Josue, de la Rosa Trevin, Jose Miguel, Conesa Mingo, Pablo, Marabini, Roberto, Sorzano Sanchez, Carlos Oscar, Carazo Garcia, Jose Maria","<p>New instrumentation for cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) has significantly increased data collection rate as well as data quality, creating bottlenecks at the image processing level. Current image processing model of moving the acquired images from the data source (electron microscope) to desktops or local clusters for processing is encountering many practical limitations. However, computing may also take place in distributed and decentralized environments. In this way, cloud is a new form of accessing computing and storage resources on demand. Here, we evaluate on how this new computational paradigm can be effectively used by extending our current integrative framework for image processing, creating ScipionCloud. This new development has resulted in a full installation of Scipion both in public and private clouds, accessible as public “images”, with all the required preinstalled cryoEM software, just requiring a Web browser to access all Graphical User Interfaces. We have profiled the performance of different configurations on Amazon Web Services and the European Federated Cloud, always on architectures incorporating GPU’s, and compared them with a local facility. We have also analyzed the economical convenience of different scenarios, so cryoEM scientists have a clearer picture of the setup that is best suited for their needs and budgets.</p>",2017,"Cryo-electron microscopy, Cloud computing, Distributed computing",10.1016/j.jsb.2017.06.004,,publication
Need for a Transport API in 5G for Global Orchestration of Cloud and Networks Through a Virtualized Infrastructure Manager and Planner,"Mayoral, Arturo, Muñoz, Raül, Vilalta, Ricard, Casellas, Ramon, Martínez, Ricardo, López, Víctor","<p>The new 5G paradigm seeks for a scalable architecture that is able to efficiently manage the increasing volume of traffic generated by smart devices to be processed in a distributed cloud infrastructure. To this end, coordinated management of the network and the cloud resources forming an end-to-end system is of great importance. Software defined networking and network function virtualization architectures are the key enablers for integrating network and cloud resources, enabling cross optimization on both sides. This optimization requires efficient resource allocation algorithms, which take into account computing and network resources. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end orchestration architecture for distributed cloud and network resources aligned with the European Telecommunications Standards Institute management and orchestration architecture. The proposed architecture includes the virtual infrastructure manager and planner (VIMaP) component to enable dynamic resource allocation for interconnected virtual instances in distributed cloud locations. A heuristic algorithm for dynamic virtual machine graphs resource allocation is included to validate the VIMaP architecture and exploit its functionalities. Moreover, the control orchestration protocol is included between the architecture components to offer end-to-end transport services. Finally, the proposed architecture is experimentally validated, and the heuristic algorithm performance is evaluated.</p>",2017,"Cloud computing, Control orchestration protocol, Network function virtualization, Orchestration, Resource allocation, Software defined networking (SDN).",10.1364/JOCN.9.000A55,,publication
Enabling Trust Assessment In Clouds-of-Clouds: A Similarity-Based Approach,"Yaich, Reda, Cuppens, Nora, Cuppens, Frédéric","<p>In multi-cloud paradigm, cloud providers collaborate to form adhoc and ephemeral groups to fullfill the request of a single customer. In such settings, malevolent cloud providers may be tempted to provide cloud services that are below the expected quality. This temptation is further exacerbated by the inability of customers to effectively identify the responsible of service outage or degradation.<br>
Furthermore, the highly competitive nature of cloud marketplaces leads each provider to propose regularly innovative new services, making the system open and highly dynamic. The introduction of new cloud services into the system challenges the established trust order as customers and providers must accept the risk of taking decisions under uncertainty. This problem, known as the cold-start problem, have been studied in the literature from the perspective of the individuals (providers/customers) but to the best of our knowledge, no prior work tried to address it from the perspective of the exchanged services and resources. To that aim, we propose in this paper a similarity-based trust model that tackles both multi-cloud (i.e., group-reputation) and services high turnover (i.e., cold-start). In our model, past similar experiences are transferred to the providers proposing new services to enable and boost decision making and collaboration. We propose also a schema to derive multi-cloud trust using both customers and providers feedback experiences. We present also evaluations results to show the benefit of using our proposal and their impact on the simulated cloud-marketplace.</p>",2017,"Trust, Multi-Clouds, Group-Reputation, Cold-Start, Similarity",10.1145/3098954.3098970,,publication
SPynq: Acceleration of Machine Learning Applications over Spark on Pynq,"Christoforos Kachris, Elias Koromilas, Ioannis Stamelos, Dimitrios Soudris","<p>Spark is one of the most widely used frameworks for data analytics that offers fast development of applications like machine learning and graph computations in distributed systems. In this paper, we present SPynq: A framework for the efficient utilization of hardware accelerators over the Spark framework on heterogeneous MPSoC FPGAs, such as Zynq. Spark has been mapped to the Pynq platform and the proposed framework allows the seamless utilization of the programmable logic for the hardware acceleration of computational intensive Spark kernels. We have also developed the required libraries in Spark that hide the accelerator’s details to minimize the design effort to utilize the accelerators. A cluster of 4 nodes (workers) based on the all-programmable MPSoCs has been implemented and the proposed platform is evaluated in a typical machine learning application based on logistic regression. The logistic regression kernel has been developed as an accelerator and incorporated to the Spark. The developed system is compared to a high-performance Xeon cluster that is typically used in cloud computing. The performance evaluation shows that the heterogeneous accelerator-based MpSoC can achieve up to 2.3x system speedup compared with a Xeon system (with 90% accuracy) and 20x better energy efficiency. For embedded application, the proposed system can achieve up to 40x speedup compared to the software only implementation on low-power embedded processors and 30x lower energy consumption.</p>",2017,"Spark, Pynq, hardware acceleration, H2020",10.5281/zenodo.836712,,publication
Advanced Concepts for Renewable Energy Supply of Data Centres,"Jaume Salom (ed.), Thorsten Urbaneck (ed.), Eduard Oró (ed.)","<p>The rapid increase of cloud computing, high performance computing (HPC) and the vast growth in Internet and Social Media use have aroused the interest in energy consumption and the carbon footprint of Data Centres. Data Centres primarily contain electronic equipment used for data processing (servers), data storage (storage equipment), and communications (network equipment). Collectively, this equipment processes, stores, and transmits digital information and is known as information technology (IT) equipment.</p>

<p><em>Advanced Concepts for Renewable Energy Supply of Data Centres</em> introduces a number of technical solutions for the supply of power and cooling energy into Data Centres with enhanced utilisation of renewable energy sources in order to achieve low energy Data Centres. Because of the high energy density nature of these unique infrastructures, it is essential to implement energy efficiency measures and reduce consumption before introducing any renewable energy source. A holistic approach is used with the objective of integrating many technical solutions such as management of the IT (Information Technology) load, efficient electrical supply to the IT systems, Low-Ex air-conditioning systems, interaction with district heating and cooling networks, re-use of heat, free cooling (air, seawater, groundwater), optimal use of heat and cold storage, electrical storage and integration in smart grids.</p>

<p>This book is therefore a catalogue of advanced technical concepts that could be integrated into Data Centres portfolio in order to increase the overall efficiency and the share of renewable energies in power and cooling supply. Based on dynamic energy models implemented in TRNSYS some concepts are deeply evaluated through yearly simulations. The results of the simulation are illustrated with Sankey charts, where the energy flows per year within the subsystems of each concept for a selected scenario are shown, and graphs showing the results of parametric analysis. A set of environmental metrics (as the non-renewable primary energy) and financial metrics (CAPEX and OPEX) as well of energy efficiency metrics like the well-known PUE, are described and used to evaluate the different technical concepts.</p>",2017,"Information technology, Data centres, IT management, Energy efficiency, Power supply, Cooling supply, Renewable energy, Environmental impact and financial metrics",10.13052/rp-9788793519411,,publication

A COST-EFFECTIVE PRIVACY PRESERVING USING ANONYMIZATION BASED HYBRID BAT ALGORITHM WITH SIMULATED ANNEALING APPROACH FOR INTERMEDIATE DATA SETS OVER CLOUD COMPUTING,"J. Sasidevi, Dr. R. Sugumar, P. Shanmuaga Priya","<p>Cloud computing is the long dreamed vision of computing as a utility, where users can remotely store their data into the cloud. In the existing research, balanced aware Fire Fly Optimization (BFFO) algorithm is used for privacy aware data set scheduling. However the existing algorithm has running time complexity and privacy preserving efficiency is reduced significantly due to lack of anonymization algorithm. To overcome the above mentioned issues, in this research, anonymization based hybrid bat algorithm with simulated annealing (AHBSA) is introduced. In the proposed system, anonymization method is used to ensure the privacy on sensitive dataset. It prevents the original information from the malicious users in the cloud environment. HBSA optimization algorithm is applied for selecting the significant attributes and achieved the privacy based on the privacy policy. It is also used to reduce the privacy preservation cost considerably. AHBSA algorithm is finding the unauthorized users and protects the intermediate dataset by providing the privacy. The efficient encryption technique is applied to provide security hence the cloud users can obtain the secret information without compromising privacy. The experimental result prove that the proposed system shows higher privacy, lower cost, lower time complexity and better anonymization by using AHBSA approach than the existing cost based Heuristic (C_HEU) &nbsp;and BFFO algorithms.</p>",2017,"Privacy Preserving, Anonymization, Intermediate Data Set, AHBSA Algorithm & Cloud Computing",10.5281/zenodo.1069736,,publication

ROLE BASED SECURED ACCESS OF DATA IN CLOUDS,"R. Saravana Kumar, Dr. P. Suresh","<p>In mobile wireless sensor network, coverage and energyCloud computing is a type of internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g., computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services, which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Attribute-based access control defines an access control paradigm whereby access rights are granted to users through the use of policies which combine attributes together. The policies can use any type of attributes such as user attributes, resource attributes, object and environment attributes etc. This model supports Boolean logic, in which rules contain ""if-then"" statements about who is making the request, the resource and the action. The main problem in attribute–based access control is not having user-centric approach for authorization rules. In ABAC model role hierarchy and object hierarchy is not achieved and restriction in level of expressiveness in access control rules.Secured role-based access control allows managing authorization based on rule-based approach where rules are under the control of data owner and provides enriched role-based expressiveness including role and object hierarchies. Data user without the knowledge of data owner cannot use the cloud server where privilege is provided to data user by data owner. Access control computations are delegated to the cloud service provider, being this not only unable to access the data, but also unable to release it to unauthorized parties. A identity-based proxy re-encryption scheme has been used in order to provide a comprehensive and feasible solution for data centric-approach. Semantic web technologies have been exposed for the representation and evaluation of the authorization model.</p>",2017,"Data-Centric Security, Cloud Computing, Role-Based Access Control & Authorization",10.5281/zenodo.438627,,publication

Analysis results show that this scheme can resist conspired attacks.</p>",2017,"Cloud storage security, sharing storage, attributes, Hash algorithm.",10.5281/zenodo.1127308,,publication
Ontology-Based Backpropagation Neural Network Classification and Reasoning Strategy for NoSQL and SQL Databases,"Hao-Hsiang Ku, Ching-Ho Chi","<p>Big data applications have become an imperative for many fields. Many researchers have been devoted into increasing correct rates and reducing time complexities. Hence, the study designs and proposes an Ontology-based backpropagation neural network classification and reasoning strategy for NoSQL big data applications, which is called ON4NoSQL. ON4NoSQL is responsible for enhancing the performances of classifications in NoSQL and SQL databases to build up mass behavior models. Mass behavior models are made by MapReduce techniques and Hadoop distributed file system based on Hadoop service platform. The reference engine of ON4NoSQL is the ontology-based backpropagation neural network classification and reasoning strategy. Simulation results indicate that ON4NoSQL can efficiently achieve to construct a high performance environment for data storing, searching, and retrieving.</p>",2017,"Hadoop, NoSQL, ontology, backpropagation neural network, and high distributed file system.",10.5281/zenodo.1132613,,publication
BALANCED AWARE FIREFLY OPTIMIZATION BASED COST-EFFECTIVE PRIVACY PRESERVING APPROACH OF INTERMEDIATE DATA SETS OVER CLOUD COMPUTING,"J. Sasidevi, Dr. R. Sugumar, P. Shanmuaga Priya","<p>Cloud computing is an embryonic archetype with remarkable impetus; however its exclusive facets intensify safety and privacy confronts. In the previous method, the privacy of intermediate data set problems is dealt with which is concentrated to regain privacy sensitive information. Alternatively the previous system contains problem with time and cost intricacy. As well it contains issue with dealing privacy conscious well-organized scheduling of intermediate data sets in cloud by considering privacy preserving. In order to surmount the above stated problems, in the existing system, enhanced balanced scheduling methodology is presented to get better the cost complexity and privacy preservation. Balanced aware FireFly Optimization (BFFO) is used for proficient privacy conscious data set scheduling. This technique is utilized to discover the resolution that carries out best on poise amongst a set of resolutions with similar execution time. Consequently the research system gives superior privacy preservation and enhanced scheduling cost more willingly than the previous method. The encryption technique is used to guarantee the security and end users decrypted the real information with improved privacy. The experimentation outcome show that the presented method confirms superior privacy, lesser cost, lesser time complexity and proficient storage metrics utilizing BFFO methodology compared to the previous Cost based Heuristic (C_HEU) algorithm.</p>",2017,,10.5281/zenodo.1069726,,publication
Conceptualizing the Knowledge to Manage and Utilize Data Assets in the Context of Digitization: Case Studies of Multinational Industrial Enterprises,"Martin Böhmer, Agatha Dabrowski, Boris Otto","<p>The trend of digitization significantly changes the role of data for enterprises. Data turn from an enabler to an intangible organizational asset that requires management and qualifies as a tradeable good. The idea of a networked economy has gained momentum in the data domain as collaborative approaches for data management emerge. Traditional organizational knowledge consequently needs to be extended by comprehensive knowledge about data. The knowledge about data is vital for organizations to ensure that data quality requirements are met and data can be effectively utilized and sovereignly governed. As this specific knowledge has been paid little attention to so far by academics, the aim of the research presented in this paper is to conceptualize it by proposing a &ldquo;data knowledge model&rdquo;. Relevant model entities have been identified based on a design science research (DSR) approach that iteratively integrates insights of various industry case studies and literature research.</p>",2017,"Data management, digitization, Industry 4.0, knowledge engineering, metamodel.",10.5281/zenodo.1129760,,publication
Collision Detection Algorithm Based on Data Parallelism,"Zhen Peng, Baifeng Wu","<p>Modern computing technology enters the era of parallel computing with the trend of sustainable and scalable parallelism. Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) is an important way to go along with the trend. It is able to gather more and more computing ability by increasing the number of processor cores without the need of modifying the program. Meanwhile, in the field of scientific computing and engineering design, many computation intensive applications are facing the challenge of increasingly large amount of data. Data parallel computing will be an important way to further improve the performance of these applications. In this paper, we take the accurate collision detection in building information modeling as an example. We demonstrate a model for constructing a data parallel algorithm. According to the model, a complex object is decomposed into the sets of simple objects; collision detection among complex objects is converted into those among simple objects. The resulting algorithm is a typical SIMD algorithm, and its advantages in parallelism and scalability is unparalleled in respect to the traditional algorithms.</p>",2017,"Data parallelism, collision detection, single instruction multiple data, building information modeling, continuous scalability.",10.5281/zenodo.1129097,,publication
Analysis of the Diffusion Behavior of an Information and Communication Technology Platform for City Logistics,"Giulio Mangano, Alberto De Marco, Giovanni Zenezini","<p>The concept of City Logistics (CL) has emerged to improve the impacts of last mile freight distribution in urban areas. In this paper, a System Dynamics (SD) model exploring the dynamics of the diffusion of a ICT platform for CL management across different populations is proposed. For the development of the model two sources have been used. On the one hand, the major diffusion variables and feedback loops are derived from a literature review of existing diffusion models. On the other hand, the parameters are represented by the value propositions delivered by the platform as a response to some of the users&rsquo; needs. To extract the most important value propositions the Business Model Canvas approach has been used. Such approach in fact focuses on understanding how a company can create value for her target customers. These variables and parameters are thus translated into a SD diffusion model with three different populations namely municipalities, logistics service providers, and own account carriers. Results show that, the three populations under analysis fully adopt the platform within the simulation time frame, highlighting a strong demand by different stakeholders for CL projects aiming at carrying out more efficient urban logistics operations.</p>",2017,"City logistics, simulation, system dynamics, business model.",10.5281/zenodo.1132335,,publication
